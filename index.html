      CHAPTER 1. Loomings.

      Call me Ishmael. Some years ago—never mind how long precisely—having
      little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me
      on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part
      of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and
      regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about
      the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever
      I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and
      bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever
      my hypos get such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral
      principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and
      methodically knocking people’s hats off—then, I account it high time to
      get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball.
      With a philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I
      quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they
      but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other,
      cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.
      
      There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by
      wharves as Indian isles by coral reefs—commerce surrounds it with her
      surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme
      downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and
      cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of
      land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.
      
      Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears
      Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What
      do you see?—Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand
      thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some
      leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some
      looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the
      rigging, as if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these
      are all landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster—tied to
      counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are
      the green fields gone? What do they here?
      
      But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and
      seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the
      extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder
      warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water
      as they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand—miles of
      them—leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets
      and avenues—north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell
      me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all
      those ships attract them thither?
      
      Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take
      almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a
      dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in
      it. Let the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest
      reveries—stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will
      infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region.
      Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this
      experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical
      professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for
      ever.
      
      But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest,
      quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley
      of the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his
      trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were
      within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up
      from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands
      winds a mazy way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in
      their hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and
      though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this
      shepherd’s head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd’s eye were
      fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June,
      when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among
      Tiger-lilies—what is the one charm wanting?—Water—there is not a drop
      of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would you travel
      your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon
      suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy
      him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian
      trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy with a
      robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea?
      Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a
      mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out
      of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did
      the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely
      all this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that
      story of Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild
      image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that
      same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image
      of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.
      
      Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin
      to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my
      lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a
      passenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a
      purse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers
      get sea-sick—grow quarrelsome—don’t sleep of nights—do not enjoy
      themselves much, as a general thing;—no, I never go as a passenger;
      nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a
      Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction
      of such offices to those who like them. For my part, I abominate all
      honorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind
      whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to take care of myself,
      without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not.
      And as for going as cook,—though I confess there is considerable glory
      in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board—yet, somehow, I
      never fancied broiling fowls;—though once broiled, judiciously
      buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who
      will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled
      fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old
      Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse, that you see the
      mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the pyramids.
      
      No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,
      plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head.
      True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to
      spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of
      thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one’s sense of honor,
      particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the
      Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if
      just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been
      lording it as a country schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in
      awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a
      schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and
      the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear it. But even this wears off
      in time.
      
      What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom
      and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed,
      I mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel
      Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and
      respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who ain’t
      a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may
      order me about—however they may thump and punch me about, I have the
      satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is
      one way or other served in much the same way—either in a physical or
      metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is
      passed round, and all hands should rub each other’s shoulder-blades,
      and be content.
      
      Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of
      paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single
      penny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must
      pay. And there is all the difference in the world between paying and
      being paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable
      infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us. But _being
      paid_,—what will compare with it? The urbane activity with which a man
      receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so earnestly
      believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no
      account can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we consign
      ourselves to perdition!
      
      Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome
      exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world,
      head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if
      you never violate the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the
      Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from
      the sailors on the forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not
      so. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many
      other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it. But
      wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a
      merchant sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a whaling
      voyage; this the invisible police officer of the Fates, who has the
      constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in
      some unaccountable way—he can better answer than any one else. And,
      doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand
      programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in
      as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive
      performances. I take it that this part of the bill must have run
      something like this:
      
      “_Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States._
      “WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. “BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.”
      
      Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the
      Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when
      others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short
      and easy parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces—though I
      cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the
      circumstances, I think I can see a little into the springs and motives
      which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced
      me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the
      delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill
      and discriminating judgment.
      
      Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale
      himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my
      curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island
      bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all
      the attending marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds,
      helped to sway me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things
      would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an
      everlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and
      land on barbarous coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to
      perceive a horror, and could still be social with it—would they let
      me—since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of
      the place one lodges in.
      
      By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the
      great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild
      conceits that swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into
      my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them
      all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.
      
      
      CHAPTER 2. The Carpet-Bag.
      
      I stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet-bag, tucked it under my
      arm, and started for Cape Horn and the Pacific. Quitting the good city
      of old Manhatto, I duly arrived in New Bedford. It was a Saturday night
      in December. Much was I disappointed upon learning that the little
      packet for Nantucket had already sailed, and that no way of reaching
      that place would offer, till the following Monday.
      
      As most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at
      this same New Bedford, thence to embark on their voyage, it may as well
      be related that I, for one, had no idea of so doing. For my mind was
      made up to sail in no other than a Nantucket craft, because there was a
      fine, boisterous something about everything connected with that famous
      old island, which amazingly pleased me. Besides though New Bedford has
      of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling, and though
      in this matter poor old Nantucket is now much behind her, yet Nantucket
      was her great original—the Tyre of this Carthage;—the place where the
      first dead American whale was stranded. Where else but from Nantucket
      did those aboriginal whalemen, the Red-Men, first sally out in canoes
      to give chase to the Leviathan? And where but from Nantucket, too, did
      that first adventurous little sloop put forth, partly laden with
      imported cobblestones—so goes the story—to throw at the whales, in
      order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the
      bowsprit?
      
      Now having a night, a day, and still another night following before me
      in New Bedford, ere I could embark for my destined port, it became a
      matter of concernment where I was to eat and sleep meanwhile. It was a
      very dubious-looking, nay, a very dark and dismal night, bitingly cold
      and cheerless. I knew no one in the place. With anxious grapnels I had
      sounded my pocket, and only brought up a few pieces of silver,—So,
      wherever you go, Ishmael, said I to myself, as I stood in the middle of
      a dreary street shouldering my bag, and comparing the gloom towards the
      north with the darkness towards the south—wherever in your wisdom you
      may conclude to lodge for the night, my dear Ishmael, be sure to
      inquire the price, and don’t be too particular.
      
      With halting steps I paced the streets, and passed the sign of “The
      Crossed Harpoons”—but it looked too expensive and jolly there. Further
      on, from the bright red windows of the “Sword-Fish Inn,” there came
      such fervent rays, that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and
      ice from before the house, for everywhere else the congealed frost lay
      ten inches thick in a hard, asphaltic pavement,—rather weary for me,
      when I struck my foot against the flinty projections, because from
      hard, remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most
      miserable plight. Too expensive and jolly, again thought I, pausing one
      moment to watch the broad glare in the street, and hear the sounds of
      the tinkling glasses within. But go on, Ishmael, said I at last; don’t
      you hear? get away from before the door; your patched boots are
      stopping the way. So on I went. I now by instinct followed the streets
      that took me waterward, for there, doubtless, were the cheapest, if not
      the cheeriest inns.
      
      Such dreary streets! blocks of blackness, not houses, on either hand,
      and here and there a candle, like a candle moving about in a tomb. At
      this hour of the night, of the last day of the week, that quarter of
      the town proved all but deserted. But presently I came to a smoky light
      proceeding from a low, wide building, the door of which stood
      invitingly open. It had a careless look, as if it were meant for the
      uses of the public; so, entering, the first thing I did was to stumble
      over an ash-box in the porch. Ha! thought I, ha, as the flying
      particles almost choked me, are these ashes from that destroyed city,
      Gomorrah? But “The Crossed Harpoons,” and “The Sword-Fish?”—this, then
      must needs be the sign of “The Trap.” However, I picked myself up and
      hearing a loud voice within, pushed on and opened a second, interior
      door.
      
      It seemed the great Black Parliament sitting in Tophet. A hundred black
      faces turned round in their rows to peer; and beyond, a black Angel of
      Doom was beating a book in a pulpit. It was a negro church; and the
      preacher’s text was about the blackness of darkness, and the weeping
      and wailing and teeth-gnashing there. Ha, Ishmael, muttered I, backing
      out, Wretched entertainment at the sign of ‘The Trap!’
      
      Moving on, I at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the
      docks, and heard a forlorn creaking in the air; and looking up, saw a
      swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it, faintly
      representing a tall straight jet of misty spray, and these words
      underneath—“The Spouter Inn:—Peter Coffin.”
      
      Coffin?—Spouter?—Rather ominous in that particular connexion, thought
      I. But it is a common name in Nantucket, they say, and I suppose this
      Peter here is an emigrant from there. As the light looked so dim, and
      the place, for the time, looked quiet enough, and the dilapidated
      little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here
      from the ruins of some burnt district, and as the swinging sign had a
      poverty-stricken sort of creak to it, I thought that here was the very
      spot for cheap lodgings, and the best of pea coffee.
      
      It was a queer sort of place—a gable-ended old house, one side palsied
      as it were, and leaning over sadly. It stood on a sharp bleak corner,
      where that tempestuous wind Euroclydon kept up a worse howling than
      ever it did about poor Paul’s tossed craft. Euroclydon, nevertheless,
      is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one in-doors, with his feet on the
      hob quietly toasting for bed. “In judging of that tempestuous wind
      called Euroclydon,” says an old writer—of whose works I possess the
      only copy extant—“it maketh a marvellous difference, whether thou
      lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the
      outside, or whether thou observest it from that sashless window, where
      the frost is on both sides, and of which the wight Death is the only
      glazier.” True enough, thought I, as this passage occurred to my
      mind—old black-letter, thou reasonest well. Yes, these eyes are
      windows, and this body of mine is the house. What a pity they didn’t
      stop up the chinks and the crannies though, and thrust in a little lint
      here and there. But it’s too late to make any improvements now. The
      universe is finished; the copestone is on, and the chips were carted
      off a million years ago. Poor Lazarus there, chattering his teeth
      against the curbstone for his pillow, and shaking off his tatters with
      his shiverings, he might plug up both ears with rags, and put a
      corn-cob into his mouth, and yet that would not keep out the
      tempestuous Euroclydon. Euroclydon! says old Dives, in his red silken
      wrapper—(he had a redder one afterwards) pooh, pooh! What a fine frosty
      night; how Orion glitters; what northern lights! Let them talk of their
      oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories; give me the
      privilege of making my own summer with my own coals.
      
      But what thinks Lazarus? Can he warm his blue hands by holding them up
      to the grand northern lights? Would not Lazarus rather be in Sumatra
      than here? Would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the
      line of the equator; yea, ye gods! go down to the fiery pit itself, in
      order to keep out this frost?
      
      Now, that Lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the
      door of Dives, this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be
      moored to one of the Moluccas. Yet Dives himself, he too lives like a
      Czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs, and being a president of a
      temperance society, he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans.
      
      But no more of this blubbering now, we are going a-whaling, and there
      is plenty of that yet to come. Let us scrape the ice from our frosted
      feet, and see what sort of a place this “Spouter” may be.
      
      
      CHAPTER 3. The Spouter-Inn.
      
      Entering that gable-ended Spouter-Inn, you found yourself in a wide,
      low, straggling entry with old-fashioned wainscots, reminding one of
      the bulwarks of some condemned old craft. On one side hung a very large
      oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked, and every way defaced, that in the
      unequal crosslights by which you viewed it, it was only by diligent
      study and a series of systematic visits to it, and careful inquiry of
      the neighbors, that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its
      purpose. Such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows, that at first
      you almost thought some ambitious young artist, in the time of the New
      England hags, had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched. But by dint
      of much and earnest contemplation, and oft repeated ponderings, and
      especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the
      entry, you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea, however
      wild, might not be altogether unwarranted.
      
      But what most puzzled and confounded you was a long, limber,
      portentous, black mass of something hovering in the centre of the
      picture over three blue, dim, perpendicular lines floating in a
      nameless yeast. A boggy, soggy, squitchy picture truly, enough to drive
      a nervous man distracted. Yet was there a sort of indefinite,
      half-attained, unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to
      it, till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what
      that marvellous painting meant. Ever and anon a bright, but, alas,
      deceptive idea would dart you through.—It’s the Black Sea in a midnight
      gale.—It’s the unnatural combat of the four primal elements.—It’s a
      blasted heath.—It’s a Hyperborean winter scene.—It’s the breaking-up of
      the icebound stream of Time. But at last all these fancies yielded to
      that one portentous something in the picture’s midst. _That_ once found
      out, and all the rest were plain. But stop; does it not bear a faint
      resemblance to a gigantic fish? even the great leviathan himself?
      
      In fact, the artist’s design seemed this: a final theory of my own,
      partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with
      whom I conversed upon the subject. The picture represents a Cape-Horner
      in a great hurricane; the half-foundered ship weltering there with its
      three dismantled masts alone visible; and an exasperated whale,
      purposing to spring clean over the craft, is in the enormous act of
      impaling himself upon the three mast-heads.
      
      The opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish
      array of monstrous clubs and spears. Some were thickly set with
      glittering teeth resembling ivory saws; others were tufted with knots
      of human hair; and one was sickle-shaped, with a vast handle sweeping
      round like the segment made in the new-mown grass by a long-armed
      mower. You shuddered as you gazed, and wondered what monstrous cannibal
      and savage could ever have gone a death-harvesting with such a hacking,
      horrifying implement. Mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances
      and harpoons all broken and deformed. Some were storied weapons. With
      this once long lance, now wildly elbowed, fifty years ago did Nathan
      Swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset. And that
      harpoon—so like a corkscrew now—was flung in Javan seas, and run away
      with by a whale, years afterwards slain off the Cape of Blanco. The
      original iron entered nigh the tail, and, like a restless needle
      sojourning in the body of a man, travelled full forty feet, and at last
      was found imbedded in the hump.
      
      Crossing this dusky entry, and on through yon low-arched way—cut
      through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with
      fireplaces all round—you enter the public room. A still duskier place
      is this, with such low ponderous beams above, and such old wrinkled
      planks beneath, that you would almost fancy you trod some old craft’s
      cockpits, especially of such a howling night, when this corner-anchored
      old ark rocked so furiously. On one side stood a long, low, shelf-like
      table covered with cracked glass cases, filled with dusty rarities
      gathered from this wide world’s remotest nooks. Projecting from the
      further angle of the room stands a dark-looking den—the bar—a rude
      attempt at a right whale’s head. Be that how it may, there stands the
      vast arched bone of the whale’s jaw, so wide, a coach might almost
      drive beneath it. Within are shabby shelves, ranged round with old
      decanters, bottles, flasks; and in those jaws of swift destruction,
      like another cursed Jonah (by which name indeed they called him),
      bustles a little withered old man, who, for their money, dearly sells
      the sailors deliriums and death.
      
      Abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison. Though true
      cylinders without—within, the villanous green goggling glasses
      deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom. Parallel meridians
      rudely pecked into the glass, surround these footpads’ goblets. Fill to
      _this_ mark, and your charge is but a penny; to _this_ a penny more;
      and so on to the full glass—the Cape Horn measure, which you may gulp
      down for a shilling.
      
      Upon entering the place I found a number of young seamen gathered about
      a table, examining by a dim light divers specimens of _skrimshander_. I
      sought the landlord, and telling him I desired to be accommodated with
      a room, received for answer that his house was full—not a bed
      unoccupied. “But avast,” he added, tapping his forehead, “you haint no
      objections to sharing a harpooneer’s blanket, have ye? I s’pose you are
      goin’ a-whalin’, so you’d better get used to that sort of thing.”
      
      I told him that I never liked to sleep two in a bed; that if I should
      ever do so, it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be, and that
      if he (the landlord) really had no other place for me, and the
      harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable, why rather than wander
      further about a strange town on so bitter a night, I would put up with
      the half of any decent man’s blanket.
      
      “I thought so. All right; take a seat. Supper?—you want supper?
      Supper’ll be ready directly.”
      
      I sat down on an old wooden settle, carved all over like a bench on the
      Battery. At one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with
      his jack-knife, stooping over and diligently working away at the space
      between his legs. He was trying his hand at a ship under full sail, but
      he didn’t make much headway, I thought.
      
      At last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an
      adjoining room. It was cold as Iceland—no fire at all—the landlord said
      he couldn’t afford it. Nothing but two dismal tallow candles, each in a
      winding sheet. We were fain to button up our monkey jackets, and hold
      to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers. But the
      fare was of the most substantial kind—not only meat and potatoes, but
      dumplings; good heavens! dumplings for supper! One young fellow in a
      green box coat, addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful
      manner.
      
      “My boy,” said the landlord, “you’ll have the nightmare to a dead
      sartainty.”
      
      “Landlord,” I whispered, “that aint the harpooneer is it?”
      
      “Oh, no,” said he, looking a sort of diabolically funny, “the
      harpooneer is a dark complexioned chap. He never eats dumplings, he
      don’t—he eats nothing but steaks, and he likes ’em rare.”
      
      “The devil he does,” says I. “Where is that harpooneer? Is he here?”
      
      “He’ll be here afore long,” was the answer.
      
      I could not help it, but I began to feel suspicious of this “dark
      complexioned” harpooneer. At any rate, I made up my mind that if it so
      turned out that we should sleep together, he must undress and get into
      bed before I did.
      
      Supper over, the company went back to the bar-room, when, knowing not
      what else to do with myself, I resolved to spend the rest of the
      evening as a looker on.
      
      Presently a rioting noise was heard without. Starting up, the landlord
      cried, “That’s the Grampus’s crew. I seed her reported in the offing
      this morning; a three years’ voyage, and a full ship. Hurrah, boys; now
      we’ll have the latest news from the Feegees.”
      
      A tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry; the door was flung
      open, and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough. Enveloped in their
      shaggy watch coats, and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters,
      all bedarned and ragged, and their beards stiff with icicles, they
      seemed an eruption of bears from Labrador. They had just landed from
      their boat, and this was the first house they entered. No wonder, then,
      that they made a straight wake for the whale’s mouth—the bar—when the
      wrinkled little old Jonah, there officiating, soon poured them out
      brimmers all round. One complained of a bad cold in his head, upon
      which Jonah mixed him a pitch-like potion of gin and molasses, which he
      swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever, never
      mind of how long standing, or whether caught off the coast of Labrador,
      or on the weather side of an ice-island.
      
      The liquor soon mounted into their heads, as it generally does even
      with the arrantest topers newly landed from sea, and they began
      capering about most obstreperously.
      
      I observed, however, that one of them held somewhat aloof, and though
      he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his
      own sober face, yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much
      noise as the rest. This man interested me at once; and since the
      sea-gods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate (though
      but a sleeping-partner one, so far as this narrative is concerned), I
      will here venture upon a little description of him. He stood full six
      feet in height, with noble shoulders, and a chest like a coffer-dam. I
      have seldom seen such brawn in a man. His face was deeply brown and
      burnt, making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast; while in the
      deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem
      to give him much joy. His voice at once announced that he was a
      Southerner, and from his fine stature, I thought he must be one of
      those tall mountaineers from the Alleghanian Ridge in Virginia. When
      the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height, this man
      slipped away unobserved, and I saw no more of him till he became my
      comrade on the sea. In a few minutes, however, he was missed by his
      shipmates, and being, it seems, for some reason a huge favourite with
      them, they raised a cry of “Bulkington! Bulkington! where’s
      Bulkington?” and darted out of the house in pursuit of him.
      
      It was now about nine o’clock, and the room seeming almost
      supernaturally quiet after these orgies, I began to congratulate myself
      upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the
      entrance of the seamen.
      
      No man prefers to sleep two in a bed. In fact, you would a good deal
      rather not sleep with your own brother. I don’t know how it is, but
      people like to be private when they are sleeping. And when it comes to
      sleeping with an unknown stranger, in a strange inn, in a strange town,
      and that stranger a harpooneer, then your objections indefinitely
      multiply. Nor was there any earthly reason why I as a sailor should
      sleep two in a bed, more than anybody else; for sailors no more sleep
      two in a bed at sea, than bachelor Kings do ashore. To be sure they all
      sleep together in one apartment, but you have your own hammock, and
      cover yourself with your own blanket, and sleep in your own skin.
      
      The more I pondered over this harpooneer, the more I abominated the
      thought of sleeping with him. It was fair to presume that being a
      harpooneer, his linen or woollen, as the case might be, would not be of
      the tidiest, certainly none of the finest. I began to twitch all over.
      Besides, it was getting late, and my decent harpooneer ought to be home
      and going bedwards. Suppose now, he should tumble in upon me at
      midnight—how could I tell from what vile hole he had been coming?
      
      “Landlord! I’ve changed my mind about that harpooneer.—I shan’t sleep
      with him. I’ll try the bench here.”
      
      “Just as you please; I’m sorry I can’t spare ye a tablecloth for a
      mattress, and it’s a plaguy rough board here”—feeling of the knots and
      notches. “But wait a bit, Skrimshander; I’ve got a carpenter’s plane
      there in the bar—wait, I say, and I’ll make ye snug enough.” So saying
      he procured the plane; and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting
      the bench, vigorously set to planing away at my bed, the while grinning
      like an ape. The shavings flew right and left; till at last the
      plane-iron came bump against an indestructible knot. The landlord was
      near spraining his wrist, and I told him for heaven’s sake to quit—the
      bed was soft enough to suit me, and I did not know how all the planing
      in the world could make eider down of a pine plank. So gathering up the
      shavings with another grin, and throwing them into the great stove in
      the middle of the room, he went about his business, and left me in a
      brown study.
      
      I now took the measure of the bench, and found that it was a foot too
      short; but that could be mended with a chair. But it was a foot too
      narrow, and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher
      than the planed one—so there was no yoking them. I then placed the
      first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall,
      leaving a little interval between, for my back to settle down in. But I
      soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from
      under the sill of the window, that this plan would never do at all,
      especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from
      the window, and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in
      the immediate vicinity of the spot where I had thought to spend the
      night.
      
      The devil fetch that harpooneer, thought I, but stop, couldn’t I steal
      a march on him—bolt his door inside, and jump into his bed, not to be
      wakened by the most violent knockings? It seemed no bad idea; but upon
      second thoughts I dismissed it. For who could tell but what the next
      morning, so soon as I popped out of the room, the harpooneer might be
      standing in the entry, all ready to knock me down!
      
      Still, looking round me again, and seeing no possible chance of
      spending a sufferable night unless in some other person’s bed, I began
      to think that after all I might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices
      against this unknown harpooneer. Thinks I, I’ll wait awhile; he must be
      dropping in before long. I’ll have a good look at him then, and perhaps
      we may become jolly good bedfellows after all—there’s no telling.
      
      But though the other boarders kept coming in by ones, twos, and threes,
      and going to bed, yet no sign of my harpooneer.
      
      “Landlord!” said I, “what sort of a chap is he—does he always keep such
      late hours?” It was now hard upon twelve o’clock.
      
      The landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle, and seemed to be
      mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension. “No,” he
      answered, “generally he’s an early bird—airley to bed and airley to
      rise—yes, he’s the bird what catches the worm. But to-night he went out
      a peddling, you see, and I don’t see what on airth keeps him so late,
      unless, may be, he can’t sell his head.”
      
      “Can’t sell his head?—What sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are
      telling me?” getting into a towering rage. “Do you pretend to say,
      landlord, that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed
      Saturday night, or rather Sunday morning, in peddling his head around
      this town?”
      
      “That’s precisely it,” said the landlord, “and I told him he couldn’t
      sell it here, the market’s overstocked.”
      
      “With what?” shouted I.
      
      “With heads to be sure; ain’t there too many heads in the world?”
      
      “I tell you what it is, landlord,” said I quite calmly, “you’d better
      stop spinning that yarn to me—I’m not green.”
      
      “May be not,” taking out a stick and whittling a toothpick, “but I
      rayther guess you’ll be done _brown_ if that ere harpooneer hears you a
      slanderin’ his head.”
      
      “I’ll break it for him,” said I, now flying into a passion again at
      this unaccountable farrago of the landlord’s.
      
      “It’s broke a’ready,” said he.
      
      “Broke,” said I—“_broke_, do you mean?”
      
      “Sartain, and that’s the very reason he can’t sell it, I guess.”
      
      “Landlord,” said I, going up to him as cool as Mt. Hecla in a
      snow-storm—“landlord, stop whittling. You and I must understand one
      another, and that too without delay. I come to your house and want a
      bed; you tell me you can only give me half a one; that the other half
      belongs to a certain harpooneer. And about this harpooneer, whom I have
      not yet seen, you persist in telling me the most mystifying and
      exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling
      towards the man whom you design for my bedfellow—a sort of connexion,
      landlord, which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest
      degree. I now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this
      harpooneer is, and whether I shall be in all respects safe to spend the
      night with him. And in the first place, you will be so good as to unsay
      that story about selling his head, which if true I take to be good
      evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad, and I’ve no idea of
      sleeping with a madman; and you, sir, _you_ I mean, landlord, _you_,
      sir, by trying to induce me to do so knowingly, would thereby render
      yourself liable to a criminal prosecution.”
      
      “Wall,” said the landlord, fetching a long breath, “that’s a purty long
      sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then. But be easy, be
      easy, this here harpooneer I have been tellin’ you of has just arrived
      from the south seas, where he bought up a lot of ’balmed New Zealand
      heads (great curios, you know), and he’s sold all on ’em but one, and
      that one he’s trying to sell to-night, cause to-morrow’s Sunday, and it
      would not do to be sellin’ human heads about the streets when folks is
      goin’ to churches. He wanted to, last Sunday, but I stopped him just as
      he was goin’ out of the door with four heads strung on a string, for
      all the airth like a string of inions.”
      
      This account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery, and showed
      that the landlord, after all, had had no idea of fooling me—but at the
      same time what could I think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a
      Saturday night clean into the holy Sabbath, engaged in such a cannibal
      business as selling the heads of dead idolators?
      
      “Depend upon it, landlord, that harpooneer is a dangerous man.”
      
      “He pays reg’lar,” was the rejoinder. “But come, it’s getting dreadful
      late, you had better be turning flukes—it’s a nice bed; Sal and me
      slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced. There’s plenty of room
      for two to kick about in that bed; it’s an almighty big bed that. Why,
      afore we give it up, Sal used to put our Sam and little Johnny in the
      foot of it. But I got a dreaming and sprawling about one night, and
      somehow, Sam got pitched on the floor, and came near breaking his arm.
      Arter that, Sal said it wouldn’t do. Come along here, I’ll give ye a
      glim in a jiffy;” and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards
      me, offering to lead the way. But I stood irresolute; when looking at a
      clock in the corner, he exclaimed “I vum it’s Sunday—you won’t see that
      harpooneer to-night; he’s come to anchor somewhere—come along then;
      _do_ come; _won’t_ ye come?”
      
      I considered the matter a moment, and then up stairs we went, and I was
      ushered into a small room, cold as a clam, and furnished, sure enough,
      with a prodigious bed, almost big enough indeed for any four
      harpooneers to sleep abreast.
      
      “There,” said the landlord, placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest
      that did double duty as a wash-stand and centre table; “there, make
      yourself comfortable now, and good night to ye.” I turned round from
      eyeing the bed, but he had disappeared.
      
      Folding back the counterpane, I stooped over the bed. Though none of
      the most elegant, it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well. I then
      glanced round the room; and besides the bedstead and centre table,
      could see no other furniture belonging to the place, but a rude shelf,
      the four walls, and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a
      whale. Of things not properly belonging to the room, there was a
      hammock lashed up, and thrown upon the floor in one corner; also a
      large seaman’s bag, containing the harpooneer’s wardrobe, no doubt in
      lieu of a land trunk. Likewise, there was a parcel of outlandish bone
      fish hooks on the shelf over the fire-place, and a tall harpoon
      standing at the head of the bed.
      
      But what is this on the chest? I took it up, and held it close to the
      light, and felt it, and smelt it, and tried every way possible to
      arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it. I can compare it
      to nothing but a large door mat, ornamented at the edges with little
      tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an
      Indian moccasin. There was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat, as
      you see the same in South American ponchos. But could it be possible
      that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat, and parade the
      streets of any Christian town in that sort of guise? I put it on, to
      try it, and it weighed me down like a hamper, being uncommonly shaggy
      and thick, and I thought a little damp, as though this mysterious
      harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day. I went up in it to a bit
      of glass stuck against the wall, and I never saw such a sight in my
      life. I tore myself out of it in such a hurry that I gave myself a kink
      in the neck.
      
      I sat down on the side of the bed, and commenced thinking about this
      head-peddling harpooneer, and his door mat. After thinking some time on
      the bed-side, I got up and took off my monkey jacket, and then stood in
      the middle of the room thinking. I then took off my coat, and thought a
      little more in my shirt sleeves. But beginning to feel very cold now,
      half undressed as I was, and remembering what the landlord said about
      the harpooneer’s not coming home at all that night, it being so very
      late, I made no more ado, but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots,
      and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed, and commended myself
      to the care of heaven.
      
      Whether that mattress was stuffed with corn-cobs or broken crockery,
      there is no telling, but I rolled about a good deal, and could not
      sleep for a long time. At last I slid off into a light doze, and had
      pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of Nod, when I heard
      a heavy footfall in the passage, and saw a glimmer of light come into
      the room from under the door.
      
      Lord save me, thinks I, that must be the harpooneer, the infernal
      head-peddler. But I lay perfectly still, and resolved not to say a word
      till spoken to. Holding a light in one hand, and that identical New
      Zealand head in the other, the stranger entered the room, and without
      looking towards the bed, placed his candle a good way off from me on
      the floor in one corner, and then began working away at the knotted
      cords of the large bag I before spoke of as being in the room. I was
      all eagerness to see his face, but he kept it averted for some time
      while employed in unlacing the bag’s mouth. This accomplished, however,
      he turned round—when, good heavens! what a sight! Such a face! It was
      of a dark, purplish, yellow colour, here and there stuck over with
      large blackish looking squares. Yes, it’s just as I thought, he’s a
      terrible bedfellow; he’s been in a fight, got dreadfully cut, and here
      he is, just from the surgeon. But at that moment he chanced to turn his
      face so towards the light, that I plainly saw they could not be
      sticking-plasters at all, those black squares on his cheeks. They were
      stains of some sort or other. At first I knew not what to make of this;
      but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me. I remembered a story
      of a white man—a whaleman too—who, falling among the cannibals, had
      been tattooed by them. I concluded that this harpooneer, in the course
      of his distant voyages, must have met with a similar adventure. And
      what is it, thought I, after all! It’s only his outside; a man can be
      honest in any sort of skin. But then, what to make of his unearthly
      complexion, that part of it, I mean, lying round about, and completely
      independent of the squares of tattooing. To be sure, it might be
      nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning; but I never heard of a hot
      sun’s tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one. However, I had
      never been in the South Seas; and perhaps the sun there produced these
      extraordinary effects upon the skin. Now, while all these ideas were
      passing through me like lightning, this harpooneer never noticed me at
      all. But, after some difficulty having opened his bag, he commenced
      fumbling in it, and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk, and a
      seal-skin wallet with the hair on. Placing these on the old chest in
      the middle of the room, he then took the New Zealand head—a ghastly
      thing enough—and crammed it down into the bag. He now took off his
      hat—a new beaver hat—when I came nigh singing out with fresh surprise.
      There was no hair on his head—none to speak of at least—nothing but a
      small scalp-knot twisted up on his forehead. His bald purplish head now
      looked for all the world like a mildewed skull. Had not the stranger
      stood between me and the door, I would have bolted out of it quicker
      than ever I bolted a dinner.
      
      Even as it was, I thought something of slipping out of the window, but
      it was the second floor back. I am no coward, but what to make of this
      head-peddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension.
      Ignorance is the parent of fear, and being completely nonplussed and
      confounded about the stranger, I confess I was now as much afraid of
      him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at
      the dead of night. In fact, I was so afraid of him that I was not game
      enough just then to address him, and demand a satisfactory answer
      concerning what seemed inexplicable in him.
      
      Meanwhile, he continued the business of undressing, and at last showed
      his chest and arms. As I live, these covered parts of him were
      checkered with the same squares as his face; his back, too, was all
      over the same dark squares; he seemed to have been in a Thirty Years’
      War, and just escaped from it with a sticking-plaster shirt. Still
      more, his very legs were marked, as if a parcel of dark green frogs
      were running up the trunks of young palms. It was now quite plain that
      he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman
      in the South Seas, and so landed in this Christian country. I quaked to
      think of it. A peddler of heads too—perhaps the heads of his own
      brothers. He might take a fancy to mine—heavens! look at that tomahawk!
      
      But there was no time for shuddering, for now the savage went about
      something that completely fascinated my attention, and convinced me
      that he must indeed be a heathen. Going to his heavy grego, or wrapall,
      or dreadnaught, which he had previously hung on a chair, he fumbled in
      the pockets, and produced at length a curious little deformed image
      with a hunch on its back, and exactly the colour of a three days’ old
      Congo baby. Remembering the embalmed head, at first I almost thought
      that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar
      manner. But seeing that it was not at all limber, and that it glistened
      a good deal like polished ebony, I concluded that it must be nothing
      but a wooden idol, which indeed it proved to be. For now the savage
      goes up to the empty fire-place, and removing the papered fire-board,
      sets up this little hunch-backed image, like a tenpin, between the
      andirons. The chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty,
      so that I thought this fire-place made a very appropriate little shrine
      or chapel for his Congo idol.
      
      I now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image, feeling but
      ill at ease meantime—to see what was next to follow. First he takes
      about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket, and places
      them carefully before the idol; then laying a bit of ship biscuit on
      top and applying the flame from the lamp, he kindled the shavings into
      a sacrificial blaze. Presently, after many hasty snatches into the
      fire, and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers (whereby he seemed
      to be scorching them badly), he at last succeeded in drawing out the
      biscuit; then blowing off the heat and ashes a little, he made a polite
      offer of it to the little negro. But the little devil did not seem to
      fancy such dry sort of fare at all; he never moved his lips. All these
      strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from
      the devotee, who seemed to be praying in a sing-song or else singing
      some pagan psalmody or other, during which his face twitched about in
      the most unnatural manner. At last extinguishing the fire, he took the
      idol up very unceremoniously, and bagged it again in his grego pocket
      as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock.
      
      All these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness, and seeing
      him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business
      operations, and jumping into bed with me, I thought it was high time,
      now or never, before the light was put out, to break the spell in which
      I had so long been bound.
      
      But the interval I spent in deliberating what to say, was a fatal one.
      Taking up his tomahawk from the table, he examined the head of it for
      an instant, and then holding it to the light, with his mouth at the
      handle, he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke. The next moment
      the light was extinguished, and this wild cannibal, tomahawk between
      his teeth, sprang into bed with me. I sang out, I could not help it
      now; and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me.
      
      Stammering out something, I knew not what, I rolled away from him
      against the wall, and then conjured him, whoever or whatever he might
      be, to keep quiet, and let me get up and light the lamp again. But his
      guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my
      meaning.
      
      “Who-e debel you?”—he at last said—“you no speak-e, dam-me, I kill-e.”
      And so saying the lighted tomahawk began flourishing about me in the
      dark.
      
      “Landlord, for God’s sake, Peter Coffin!” shouted I. “Landlord! Watch!
      Coffin! Angels! save me!”
      
      “Speak-e! tell-ee me who-ee be, or dam-me, I kill-e!” again growled the
      cannibal, while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the
      hot tobacco ashes about me till I thought my linen would get on fire.
      But thank heaven, at that moment the landlord came into the room light
      in hand, and leaping from the bed I ran up to him.
      
      “Don’t be afraid now,” said he, grinning again, “Queequeg here wouldn’t
      harm a hair of your head.”
      
      “Stop your grinning,” shouted I, “and why didn’t you tell me that that
      infernal harpooneer was a cannibal?”
      
      “I thought ye know’d it;—didn’t I tell ye, he was a peddlin’ heads
      around town?—but turn flukes again and go to sleep. Queequeg, look
      here—you sabbee me, I sabbee—you this man sleepe you—you sabbee?”
      
      “Me sabbee plenty”—grunted Queequeg, puffing away at his pipe and
      sitting up in bed.
      
      “You gettee in,” he added, motioning to me with his tomahawk, and
      throwing the clothes to one side. He really did this in not only a
      civil but a really kind and charitable way. I stood looking at him a
      moment. For all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean, comely
      looking cannibal. What’s all this fuss I have been making about,
      thought I to myself—the man’s a human being just as I am: he has just
      as much reason to fear me, as I have to be afraid of him. Better sleep
      with a sober cannibal than a drunken Christian.
      
      “Landlord,” said I, “tell him to stash his tomahawk there, or pipe, or
      whatever you call it; tell him to stop smoking, in short, and I will
      turn in with him. But I don’t fancy having a man smoking in bed with
      me. It’s dangerous. Besides, I ain’t insured.”
      
      This being told to Queequeg, he at once complied, and again politely
      motioned me to get into bed—rolling over to one side as much as to
      say—“I won’t touch a leg of ye.”
      
      “Good night, landlord,” said I, “you may go.”
      
      I turned in, and never slept better in my life.
      
      
      CHAPTER 4. The Counterpane.
      
      Upon waking next morning about daylight, I found Queequeg’s arm thrown
      over me in the most loving and affectionate manner. You had almost
      thought I had been his wife. The counterpane was of patchwork, full of
      odd little parti-coloured squares and triangles; and this arm of his
      tattooed all over with an interminable Cretan labyrinth of a figure, no
      two parts of which were of one precise shade—owing I suppose to his
      keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade, his shirt
      sleeves irregularly rolled up at various times—this same arm of his, I
      say, looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork
      quilt. Indeed, partly lying on it as the arm did when I first awoke, I
      could hardly tell it from the quilt, they so blended their hues
      together; and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that I
      could tell that Queequeg was hugging me.
      
      My sensations were strange. Let me try to explain them. When I was a
      child, I well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me;
      whether it was a reality or a dream, I never could entirely settle. The
      circumstance was this. I had been cutting up some caper or other—I
      think it was trying to crawl up the chimney, as I had seen a little
      sweep do a few days previous; and my stepmother who, somehow or other,
      was all the time whipping me, or sending me to bed supperless,—my
      mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to
      bed, though it was only two o’clock in the afternoon of the 21st June,
      the longest day in the year in our hemisphere. I felt dreadfully. But
      there was no help for it, so up stairs I went to my little room in the
      third floor, undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time,
      and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets.
      
      I lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse
      before I could hope for a resurrection. Sixteen hours in bed! the small
      of my back ached to think of it. And it was so light too; the sun
      shining in at the window, and a great rattling of coaches in the
      streets, and the sound of gay voices all over the house. I felt worse
      and worse—at last I got up, dressed, and softly going down in my
      stockinged feet, sought out my stepmother, and suddenly threw myself at
      her feet, beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good
      slippering for my misbehaviour; anything indeed but condemning me to
      lie abed such an unendurable length of time. But she was the best and
      most conscientious of stepmothers, and back I had to go to my room. For
      several hours I lay there broad awake, feeling a great deal worse than
      I have ever done since, even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes.
      At last I must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze; and
      slowly waking from it—half steeped in dreams—I opened my eyes, and the
      before sun-lit room was now wrapped in outer darkness. Instantly I felt
      a shock running through all my frame; nothing was to be seen, and
      nothing was to be heard; but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine.
      My arm hung over the counterpane, and the nameless, unimaginable,
      silent form or phantom, to which the hand belonged, seemed closely
      seated by my bed-side. For what seemed ages piled on ages, I lay there,
      frozen with the most awful fears, not daring to drag away my hand; yet
      ever thinking that if I could but stir it one single inch, the horrid
      spell would be broken. I knew not how this consciousness at last glided
      away from me; but waking in the morning, I shudderingly remembered it
      all, and for days and weeks and months afterwards I lost myself in
      confounding attempts to explain the mystery. Nay, to this very hour, I
      often puzzle myself with it.
      
      Now, take away the awful fear, and my sensations at feeling the
      supernatural hand in mine were very similar, in their strangeness, to
      those which I experienced on waking up and seeing Queequeg’s pagan arm
      thrown round me. But at length all the past night’s events soberly
      recurred, one by one, in fixed reality, and then I lay only alive to
      the comical predicament. For though I tried to move his arm—unlock his
      bridegroom clasp—yet, sleeping as he was, he still hugged me tightly,
      as though naught but death should part us twain. I now strove to rouse
      him—“Queequeg!”—but his only answer was a snore. I then rolled over, my
      neck feeling as if it were in a horse-collar; and suddenly felt a
      slight scratch. Throwing aside the counterpane, there lay the tomahawk
      sleeping by the savage’s side, as if it were a hatchet-faced baby. A
      pretty pickle, truly, thought I; abed here in a strange house in the
      broad day, with a cannibal and a tomahawk! “Queequeg!—in the name of
      goodness, Queequeg, wake!” At length, by dint of much wriggling, and
      loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his
      hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style, I succeeded in
      extracting a grunt; and presently, he drew back his arm, shook himself
      all over like a Newfoundland dog just from the water, and sat up in
      bed, stiff as a pike-staff, looking at me, and rubbing his eyes as if
      he did not altogether remember how I came to be there, though a dim
      consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over
      him. Meanwhile, I lay quietly eyeing him, having no serious misgivings
      now, and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature. When, at
      last, his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow,
      and he became, as it were, reconciled to the fact; he jumped out upon
      the floor, and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that,
      if it pleased me, he would dress first and then leave me to dress
      afterwards, leaving the whole apartment to myself. Thinks I, Queequeg,
      under the circumstances, this is a very civilized overture; but, the
      truth is, these savages have an innate sense of delicacy, say what you
      will; it is marvellous how essentially polite they are. I pay this
      particular compliment to Queequeg, because he treated me with so much
      civility and consideration, while I was guilty of great rudeness;
      staring at him from the bed, and watching all his toilette motions; for
      the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding. Nevertheless,
      a man like Queequeg you don’t see every day, he and his ways were well
      worth unusual regarding.
      
      He commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat, a very tall
      one, by the by, and then—still minus his trowsers—he hunted up his
      boots. What under the heavens he did it for, I cannot tell, but his
      next movement was to crush himself—boots in hand, and hat on—under the
      bed; when, from sundry violent gaspings and strainings, I inferred he
      was hard at work booting himself; though by no law of propriety that I
      ever heard of, is any man required to be private when putting on his
      boots. But Queequeg, do you see, was a creature in the transition
      stage—neither caterpillar nor butterfly. He was just enough civilized
      to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners. His
      education was not yet completed. He was an undergraduate. If he had not
      been a small degree civilized, he very probably would not have troubled
      himself with boots at all; but then, if he had not been still a savage,
      he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on. At
      last, he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over
      his eyes, and began creaking and limping about the room, as if, not
      being much accustomed to boots, his pair of damp, wrinkled cowhide
      ones—probably not made to order either—rather pinched and tormented him
      at the first go off of a bitter cold morning.
      
      Seeing, now, that there were no curtains to the window, and that the
      street being very narrow, the house opposite commanded a plain view
      into the room, and observing more and more the indecorous figure that
      Queequeg made, staving about with little else but his hat and boots on;
      I begged him as well as I could, to accelerate his toilet somewhat, and
      particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible. He
      complied, and then proceeded to wash himself. At that time in the
      morning any Christian would have washed his face; but Queequeg, to my
      amazement, contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his
      chest, arms, and hands. He then donned his waistcoat, and taking up a
      piece of hard soap on the wash-stand centre table, dipped it into water
      and commenced lathering his face. I was watching to see where he kept
      his razor, when lo and behold, he takes the harpoon from the bed
      corner, slips out the long wooden stock, unsheathes the head, whets it
      a little on his boot, and striding up to the bit of mirror against the
      wall, begins a vigorous scraping, or rather harpooning of his cheeks.
      Thinks I, Queequeg, this is using Rogers’s best cutlery with a
      vengeance. Afterwards I wondered the less at this operation when I came
      to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made, and how
      exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept.
      
      The rest of his toilet was soon achieved, and he proudly marched out of
      the room, wrapped up in his great pilot monkey jacket, and sporting his
      harpoon like a marshal’s baton.
      
      
      CHAPTER 5. Breakfast.
      
      I quickly followed suit, and descending into the bar-room accosted the
      grinning landlord very pleasantly. I cherished no malice towards him,
      though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my
      bedfellow.
      
      However, a good laugh is a mighty good thing, and rather too scarce a
      good thing; the more’s the pity. So, if any one man, in his own proper
      person, afford stuff for a good joke to anybody, let him not be
      backward, but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in
      that way. And the man that has anything bountifully laughable about
      him, be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for.
      
      The bar-room was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the
      night previous, and whom I had not as yet had a good look at. They were
      nearly all whalemen; chief mates, and second mates, and third mates,
      and sea carpenters, and sea coopers, and sea blacksmiths, and
      harpooneers, and ship keepers; a brown and brawny company, with bosky
      beards; an unshorn, shaggy set, all wearing monkey jackets for morning
      gowns.
      
      You could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore. This
      young fellow’s healthy cheek is like a sun-toasted pear in hue, and
      would seem to smell almost as musky; he cannot have been three days
      landed from his Indian voyage. That man next him looks a few shades
      lighter; you might say a touch of satin wood is in him. In the
      complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn, but slightly
      bleached withal; _he_ doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore. But who
      could show a cheek like Queequeg? which, barred with various tints,
      seemed like the Andes’ western slope, to show forth in one array,
      contrasting climates, zone by zone.
      
      “Grub, ho!” now cried the landlord, flinging open a door, and in we
      went to breakfast.
      
      They say that men who have seen the world, thereby become quite at ease
      in manner, quite self-possessed in company. Not always, though:
      Ledyard, the great New England traveller, and Mungo Park, the Scotch
      one; of all men, they possessed the least assurance in the parlor. But
      perhaps the mere crossing of Siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as
      Ledyard did, or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach, in
      the negro heart of Africa, which was the sum of poor Mungo’s
      performances—this kind of travel, I say, may not be the very best mode
      of attaining a high social polish. Still, for the most part, that sort
      of thing is to be had anywhere.
      
      These reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that
      after we were all seated at the table, and I was preparing to hear some
      good stories about whaling; to my no small surprise, nearly every man
      maintained a profound silence. And not only that, but they looked
      embarrassed. Yes, here were a set of sea-dogs, many of whom without the
      slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seas—entire
      strangers to them—and duelled them dead without winking; and yet, here
      they sat at a social breakfast table—all of the same calling, all of
      kindred tastes—looking round as sheepishly at each other as though they
      had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the Green
      Mountains. A curious sight; these bashful bears, these timid warrior
      whalemen!
      
      But as for Queequeg—why, Queequeg sat there among them—at the head of
      the table, too, it so chanced; as cool as an icicle. To be sure I
      cannot say much for his breeding. His greatest admirer could not have
      cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him,
      and using it there without ceremony; reaching over the table with it,
      to the imminent jeopardy of many heads, and grappling the beefsteaks
      towards him. But _that_ was certainly very coolly done by him, and
      every one knows that in most people’s estimation, to do anything coolly
      is to do it genteelly.
      
      We will not speak of all Queequeg’s peculiarities here; how he eschewed
      coffee and hot rolls, and applied his undivided attention to
      beefsteaks, done rare. Enough, that when breakfast was over he withdrew
      like the rest into the public room, lighted his tomahawk-pipe, and was
      sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat
      on, when I sallied out for a stroll.
      
      
      CHAPTER 6. The Street.
      
      If I had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish
      an individual as Queequeg circulating among the polite society of a
      civilized town, that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first
      daylight stroll through the streets of New Bedford.
      
      In thoroughfares nigh the docks, any considerable seaport will
      frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign
      parts. Even in Broadway and Chestnut streets, Mediterranean mariners
      will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies. Regent Street is not
      unknown to Lascars and Malays; and at Bombay, in the Apollo Green, live
      Yankees have often scared the natives. But New Bedford beats all Water
      Street and Wapping. In these last-mentioned haunts you see only
      sailors; but in New Bedford, actual cannibals stand chatting at street
      corners; savages outright; many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy
      flesh. It makes a stranger stare.
      
      But, besides the Feegeeans, Tongatobooarrs, Erromanggoans, Pannangians,
      and Brighggians, and, besides the wild specimens of the whaling-craft
      which unheeded reel about the streets, you will see other sights still
      more curious, certainly more comical. There weekly arrive in this town
      scores of green Vermonters and New Hampshire men, all athirst for gain
      and glory in the fishery. They are mostly young, of stalwart frames;
      fellows who have felled forests, and now seek to drop the axe and
      snatch the whale-lance. Many are as green as the Green Mountains whence
      they came. In some things you would think them but a few hours old.
      Look there! that chap strutting round the corner. He wears a beaver hat
      and swallow-tailed coat, girdled with a sailor-belt and sheath-knife.
      Here comes another with a sou’-wester and a bombazine cloak.
      
      No town-bred dandy will compare with a country-bred one—I mean a
      downright bumpkin dandy—a fellow that, in the dog-days, will mow his
      two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands. Now when a
      country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished
      reputation, and joins the great whale-fishery, you should see the
      comical things he does upon reaching the seaport. In bespeaking his
      sea-outfit, he orders bell-buttons to his waistcoats; straps to his
      canvas trowsers. Ah, poor Hay-Seed! how bitterly will burst those
      straps in the first howling gale, when thou art driven, straps,
      buttons, and all, down the throat of the tempest.
      
      But think not that this famous town has only harpooneers, cannibals,
      and bumpkins to show her visitors. Not at all. Still New Bedford is a
      queer place. Had it not been for us whalemen, that tract of land would
      this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of
      Labrador. As it is, parts of her back country are enough to frighten
      one, they look so bony. The town itself is perhaps the dearest place to
      live in, in all New England. It is a land of oil, true enough: but not
      like Canaan; a land, also, of corn and wine. The streets do not run
      with milk; nor in the spring-time do they pave them with fresh eggs.
      Yet, in spite of this, nowhere in all America will you find more
      patrician-like houses; parks and gardens more opulent, than in New
      Bedford. Whence came they? how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of
      a country?
      
      Go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty
      mansion, and your question will be answered. Yes; all these brave
      houses and flowery gardens came from the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian
      oceans. One and all, they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the
      bottom of the sea. Can Herr Alexander perform a feat like that?
      
      In New Bedford, fathers, they say, give whales for dowers to their
      daughters, and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises a-piece.
      You must go to New Bedford to see a brilliant wedding; for, they say,
      they have reservoirs of oil in every house, and every night recklessly
      burn their lengths in spermaceti candles.
      
      In summer time, the town is sweet to see; full of fine maples—long
      avenues of green and gold. And in August, high in air, the beautiful
      and bountiful horse-chestnuts, candelabra-wise, proffer the passer-by
      their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms. So omnipotent is
      art; which in many a district of New Bedford has superinduced bright
      terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at
      creation’s final day.
      
      And the women of New Bedford, they bloom like their own red roses. But
      roses only bloom in summer; whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks
      is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens. Elsewhere match that
      bloom of theirs, ye cannot, save in Salem, where they tell me the young
      girls breathe such musk, their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off
      shore, as though they were drawing nigh the odorous Moluccas instead of
      the Puritanic sands.
      
      
      CHAPTER 7. The Chapel.
      
      In this same New Bedford there stands a Whaleman’s Chapel, and few are
      the moody fishermen, shortly bound for the Indian Ocean or Pacific, who
      fail to make a Sunday visit to the spot. I am sure that I did not.
      
      Returning from my first morning stroll, I again sallied out upon this
      special errand. The sky had changed from clear, sunny cold, to driving
      sleet and mist. Wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called
      bearskin, I fought my way against the stubborn storm. Entering, I found
      a small scattered congregation of sailors, and sailors’ wives and
      widows. A muffled silence reigned, only broken at times by the shrieks
      of the storm. Each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart
      from the other, as if each silent grief were insular and
      incommunicable. The chaplain had not yet arrived; and there these
      silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble
      tablets, with black borders, masoned into the wall on either side the
      pulpit. Three of them ran something like the following, but I do not
      pretend to quote:—
      
      SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF JOHN TALBOT, Who, at the age of eighteen, was
      lost overboard, Near the Isle of Desolation, off Patagonia, _November_
      1_st_, 1836. THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS SISTER.
      
      SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF ROBERT LONG, WILLIS ELLERY, NATHAN COLEMAN,
      WALTER CANNY, SETH MACY, AND SAMUEL GLEIG, Forming one of the boats’
      crews OF THE SHIP ELIZA Who were towed out of sight by a Whale, On the
      Off-shore Ground in the PACIFIC, _December_ 31_st_, 1839. THIS MARBLE
      Is here placed by their surviving SHIPMATES.
      
      SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF The late CAPTAIN EZEKIEL HARDY, Who in the bows
      of his boat was killed by a Sperm Whale on the coast of Japan, _August_
      3_d_, 1833. THIS TABLET Is erected to his Memory BY HIS WIDOW.
      
      Shaking off the sleet from my ice-glazed hat and jacket, I seated
      myself near the door, and turning sideways was surprised to see
      Queequeg near me. Affected by the solemnity of the scene, there was a
      wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance. This savage
      was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance; because
      he was the only one who could not read, and, therefore, was not reading
      those frigid inscriptions on the wall. Whether any of the relatives of
      the seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation,
      I knew not; but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery,
      and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not
      the trappings of some unceasing grief, that I feel sure that here
      before me were assembled those, in whose unhealing hearts the sight of
      those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed
      afresh.
      
      Oh! ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass; who standing
      among flowers can say—here, _here_ lies my beloved; ye know not the
      desolation that broods in bosoms like these. What bitter blanks in
      those black-bordered marbles which cover no ashes! What despair in
      those immovable inscriptions! What deadly voids and unbidden
      infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all Faith, and refuse
      resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a
      grave. As well might those tablets stand in the cave of Elephanta as
      here.
      
      In what census of living creatures, the dead of mankind are included;
      why it is that a universal proverb says of them, that they tell no
      tales, though containing more secrets than the Goodwin Sands; how it is
      that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world, we prefix
      so significant and infidel a word, and yet do not thus entitle him, if
      he but embarks for the remotest Indies of this living earth; why the
      Life Insurance Companies pay death-forfeitures upon immortals; in what
      eternal, unstirring paralysis, and deadly, hopeless trance, yet lies
      antique Adam who died sixty round centuries ago; how it is that we
      still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are
      dwelling in unspeakable bliss; why all the living so strive to hush all
      the dead; wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify
      a whole city. All these things are not without their meanings.
      
      But Faith, like a jackal, feeds among the tombs, and even from these
      dead doubts she gathers her most vital hope.
      
      It needs scarcely to be told, with what feelings, on the eve of a
      Nantucket voyage, I regarded those marble tablets, and by the murky
      light of that darkened, doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who
      had gone before me. Yes, Ishmael, the same fate may be thine. But
      somehow I grew merry again. Delightful inducements to embark, fine
      chance for promotion, it seems—aye, a stove boat will make me an
      immortal by brevet. Yes, there is death in this business of whaling—a
      speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into Eternity. But what
      then? Methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of Life and Death.
      Methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true
      substance. Methinks that in looking at things spiritual, we are too
      much like oysters observing the sun through the water, and thinking
      that thick water the thinnest of air. Methinks my body is but the lees
      of my better being. In fact take my body who will, take it I say, it is
      not me. And therefore three cheers for Nantucket; and come a stove boat
      and stove body when they will, for stave my soul, Jove himself cannot.
      
      
      CHAPTER 8. The Pulpit.
      
      I had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable
      robustness entered; immediately as the storm-pelted door flew back upon
      admitting him, a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation,
      sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain. Yes, it
      was the famous Father Mapple, so called by the whalemen, among whom he
      was a very great favourite. He had been a sailor and a harpooneer in
      his youth, but for many years past had dedicated his life to the
      ministry. At the time I now write of, Father Mapple was in the hardy
      winter of a healthy old age; that sort of old age which seems merging
      into a second flowering youth, for among all the fissures of his
      wrinkles, there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing
      bloom—the spring verdure peeping forth even beneath February’s snow. No
      one having previously heard his history, could for the first time
      behold Father Mapple without the utmost interest, because there were
      certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him, imputable to that
      adventurous maritime life he had led. When he entered I observed that
      he carried no umbrella, and certainly had not come in his carriage, for
      his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet, and his great pilot
      cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of
      the water it had absorbed. However, hat and coat and overshoes were one
      by one removed, and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner;
      when, arrayed in a decent suit, he quietly approached the pulpit.
      
      Like most old fashioned pulpits, it was a very lofty one, and since a
      regular stairs to such a height would, by its long angle with the
      floor, seriously contract the already small area of the chapel, the
      architect, it seemed, had acted upon the hint of Father Mapple, and
      finished the pulpit without a stairs, substituting a perpendicular side
      ladder, like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea. The wife
      of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of
      red worsted man-ropes for this ladder, which, being itself nicely
      headed, and stained with a mahogany colour, the whole contrivance,
      considering what manner of chapel it was, seemed by no means in bad
      taste. Halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder, and with both
      hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the man-ropes, Father Mapple
      cast a look upwards, and then with a truly sailor-like but still
      reverential dexterity, hand over hand, mounted the steps as if
      ascending the main-top of his vessel.
      
      The perpendicular parts of this side ladder, as is usually the case
      with swinging ones, were of cloth-covered rope, only the rounds were of
      wood, so that at every step there was a joint. At my first glimpse of
      the pulpit, it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship,
      these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary. For I was not
      prepared to see Father Mapple after gaining the height, slowly turn
      round, and stooping over the pulpit, deliberately drag up the ladder
      step by step, till the whole was deposited within, leaving him
      impregnable in his little Quebec.
      
      I pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this.
      Father Mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and
      sanctity, that I could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any
      mere tricks of the stage. No, thought I, there must be some sober
      reason for this thing; furthermore, it must symbolize something unseen.
      Can it be, then, that by that act of physical isolation, he signifies
      his spiritual withdrawal for the time, from all outward worldly ties
      and connexions? Yes, for replenished with the meat and wine of the
      word, to the faithful man of God, this pulpit, I see, is a
      self-containing stronghold—a lofty Ehrenbreitstein, with a perennial
      well of water within the walls.
      
      But the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place,
      borrowed from the chaplain’s former sea-farings. Between the marble
      cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit, the wall which formed its back
      was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating
      against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy
      breakers. But high above the flying scud and dark-rolling clouds, there
      floated a little isle of sunlight, from which beamed forth an angel’s
      face; and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the
      ship’s tossed deck, something like that silver plate now inserted into
      the Victory’s plank where Nelson fell. “Ah, noble ship,” the angel
      seemed to say, “beat on, beat on, thou noble ship, and bear a hardy
      helm; for lo! the sun is breaking through; the clouds are rolling
      off—serenest azure is at hand.”
      
      Nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same sea-taste that
      had achieved the ladder and the picture. Its panelled front was in the
      likeness of a ship’s bluff bows, and the Holy Bible rested on a
      projecting piece of scroll work, fashioned after a ship’s fiddle-headed
      beak.
      
      What could be more full of meaning?—for the pulpit is ever this earth’s
      foremost part; all the rest comes in its rear; the pulpit leads the
      world. From thence it is the storm of God’s quick wrath is first
      descried, and the bow must bear the earliest brunt. From thence it is
      the God of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds.
      Yes, the world’s a ship on its passage out, and not a voyage complete;
      and the pulpit is its prow.
      
      
      CHAPTER 9. The Sermon.
      
      Father Mapple rose, and in a mild voice of unassuming authority ordered
      the scattered people to condense. “Starboard gangway, there! side away
      to larboard—larboard gangway to starboard! Midships! midships!”
      
      There was a low rumbling of heavy sea-boots among the benches, and a
      still slighter shuffling of women’s shoes, and all was quiet again, and
      every eye on the preacher.
      
      He paused a little; then kneeling in the pulpit’s bows, folded his
      large brown hands across his chest, uplifted his closed eyes, and
      offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying
      at the bottom of the sea.
      
      This ended, in prolonged solemn tones, like the continual tolling of a
      bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fog—in such tones he
      commenced reading the following hymn; but changing his manner towards
      the concluding stanzas, burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy—
      
      
        “The ribs and terrors in the whale, Arched over me a dismal gloom,
        While all God’s sun-lit waves rolled by, And lift me deepening down
        to doom.
      
        “I saw the opening maw of hell, With endless pains and sorrows there;
        Which none but they that feel can tell— Oh, I was plunging to
        despair.
      
        “In black distress, I called my God, When I could scarce believe him
        mine, He bowed his ear to my complaints— No more the whale did me
        confine.
      
        “With speed he flew to my relief, As on a radiant dolphin borne;
        Awful, yet bright, as lightning shone The face of my Deliverer God.
      
        “My song for ever shall record That terrible, that joyful hour; I
        give the glory to my God, His all the mercy and the power.”
      
      
      
      
      Nearly all joined in singing this hymn, which swelled high above the
      howling of the storm. A brief pause ensued; the preacher slowly turned
      over the leaves of the Bible, and at last, folding his hand down upon
      the proper page, said: “Beloved shipmates, clinch the last verse of the
      first chapter of Jonah—‘And God had prepared a great fish to swallow up
      Jonah.’”
      
      “Shipmates, this book, containing only four chapters—four yarns—is one
      of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the Scriptures. Yet what
      depths of the soul does Jonah’s deep sealine sound! what a pregnant
      lesson to us is this prophet! What a noble thing is that canticle in
      the fish’s belly! How billow-like and boisterously grand! We feel the
      floods surging over us; we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the
      waters; sea-weed and all the slime of the sea is about us! But _what_
      is this lesson that the book of Jonah teaches? Shipmates, it is a
      two-stranded lesson; a lesson to us all as sinful men, and a lesson to
      me as a pilot of the living God. As sinful men, it is a lesson to us
      all, because it is a story of the sin, hard-heartedness, suddenly
      awakened fears, the swift punishment, repentance, prayers, and finally
      the deliverance and joy of Jonah. As with all sinners among men, the
      sin of this son of Amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the
      command of God—never mind now what that command was, or how
      conveyed—which he found a hard command. But all the things that God
      would have us do are hard for us to do—remember that—and hence, he
      oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade. And if we obey God, we
      must disobey ourselves; and it is in this disobeying ourselves, wherein
      the hardness of obeying God consists.
      
      “With this sin of disobedience in him, Jonah still further flouts at
      God, by seeking to flee from Him. He thinks that a ship made by men
      will carry him into countries where God does not reign, but only the
      Captains of this earth. He skulks about the wharves of Joppa, and seeks
      a ship that’s bound for Tarshish. There lurks, perhaps, a hitherto
      unheeded meaning here. By all accounts Tarshish could have been no
      other city than the modern Cadiz. That’s the opinion of learned men.
      And where is Cadiz, shipmates? Cadiz is in Spain; as far by water, from
      Joppa, as Jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days, when
      the Atlantic was an almost unknown sea. Because Joppa, the modern
      Jaffa, shipmates, is on the most easterly coast of the Mediterranean,
      the Syrian; and Tarshish or Cadiz more than two thousand miles to the
      westward from that, just outside the Straits of Gibraltar. See ye not
      then, shipmates, that Jonah sought to flee world-wide from God?
      Miserable man! Oh! most contemptible and worthy of all scorn; with
      slouched hat and guilty eye, skulking from his God; prowling among the
      shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas. So
      disordered, self-condemning is his look, that had there been policemen
      in those days, Jonah, on the mere suspicion of something wrong, had
      been arrested ere he touched a deck. How plainly he’s a fugitive! no
      baggage, not a hat-box, valise, or carpet-bag,—no friends accompany him
      to the wharf with their adieux. At last, after much dodging search, he
      finds the Tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo; and as
      he steps on board to see its Captain in the cabin, all the sailors for
      the moment desist from hoisting in the goods, to mark the stranger’s
      evil eye. Jonah sees this; but in vain he tries to look all ease and
      confidence; in vain essays his wretched smile. Strong intuitions of the
      man assure the mariners he can be no innocent. In their gamesome but
      still serious way, one whispers to the other—“Jack, he’s robbed a
      widow;” or, “Joe, do you mark him; he’s a bigamist;” or, “Harry lad, I
      guess he’s the adulterer that broke jail in old Gomorrah, or belike,
      one of the missing murderers from Sodom.” Another runs to read the bill
      that’s stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is
      moored, offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a
      parricide, and containing a description of his person. He reads, and
      looks from Jonah to the bill; while all his sympathetic shipmates now
      crowd round Jonah, prepared to lay their hands upon him. Frighted Jonah
      trembles, and summoning all his boldness to his face, only looks so
      much the more a coward. He will not confess himself suspected; but that
      itself is strong suspicion. So he makes the best of it; and when the
      sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised, they let him
      pass, and he descends into the cabin.
      
      “‘Who’s there?’ cries the Captain at his busy desk, hurriedly making
      out his papers for the Customs—‘Who’s there?’ Oh! how that harmless
      question mangles Jonah! For the instant he almost turns to flee again.
      But he rallies. ‘I seek a passage in this ship to Tarshish; how soon
      sail ye, sir?’ Thus far the busy Captain had not looked up to Jonah,
      though the man now stands before him; but no sooner does he hear that
      hollow voice, than he darts a scrutinizing glance. ‘We sail with the
      next coming tide,’ at last he slowly answered, still intently eyeing
      him. ‘No sooner, sir?’—‘Soon enough for any honest man that goes a
      passenger.’ Ha! Jonah, that’s another stab. But he swiftly calls away
      the Captain from that scent. ‘I’ll sail with ye,’—he says,—‘the passage
      money how much is that?—I’ll pay now.’ For it is particularly written,
      shipmates, as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history,
      ‘that he paid the fare thereof’ ere the craft did sail. And taken with
      the context, this is full of meaning.
      
      “Now Jonah’s Captain, shipmates, was one whose discernment detects
      crime in any, but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless. In
      this world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and
      without a passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all
      frontiers. So Jonah’s Captain prepares to test the length of Jonah’s
      purse, ere he judge him openly. He charges him thrice the usual sum;
      and it’s assented to. Then the Captain knows that Jonah is a fugitive;
      but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with
      gold. Yet when Jonah fairly takes out his purse, prudent suspicions
      still molest the Captain. He rings every coin to find a counterfeit.
      Not a forger, any way, he mutters; and Jonah is put down for his
      passage. ‘Point out my state-room, Sir,’ says Jonah now, ‘I’m
      travel-weary; I need sleep.’ ‘Thou lookest like it,’ says the Captain,
      ‘there’s thy room.’ Jonah enters, and would lock the door, but the lock
      contains no key. Hearing him foolishly fumbling there, the Captain
      laughs lowly to himself, and mutters something about the doors of
      convicts’ cells being never allowed to be locked within. All dressed
      and dusty as he is, Jonah throws himself into his berth, and finds the
      little state-room ceiling almost resting on his forehead. The air is
      close, and Jonah gasps. Then, in that contracted hole, sunk, too,
      beneath the ship’s water-line, Jonah feels the heralding presentiment
      of that stifling hour, when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of
      his bowels’ wards.
      
      “Screwed at its axis against the side, a swinging lamp slightly
      oscillates in Jonah’s room; and the ship, heeling over towards the
      wharf with the weight of the last bales received, the lamp, flame and
      all, though in slight motion, still maintains a permanent obliquity
      with reference to the room; though, in truth, infallibly straight
      itself, it but made obvious the false, lying levels among which it
      hung. The lamp alarms and frightens Jonah; as lying in his berth his
      tormented eyes roll round the place, and this thus far successful
      fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance. But that
      contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him. The floor, the
      ceiling, and the side, are all awry. ‘Oh! so my conscience hangs in
      me!’ he groans, ‘straight upwards, so it burns; but the chambers of my
      soul are all in crookedness!’
      
      “Like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed, still
      reeling, but with conscience yet pricking him, as the plungings of the
      Roman race-horse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him;
      as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy
      anguish, praying God for annihilation until the fit be passed; and at
      last amid the whirl of woe he feels, a deep stupor steals over him, as
      over the man who bleeds to death, for conscience is the wound, and
      there’s naught to staunch it; so, after sore wrestlings in his berth,
      Jonah’s prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep.
      
      “And now the time of tide has come; the ship casts off her cables; and
      from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for Tarshish, all careening,
      glides to sea. That ship, my friends, was the first of recorded
      smugglers! the contraband was Jonah. But the sea rebels; he will not
      bear the wicked burden. A dreadful storm comes on, the ship is like to
      break. But now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her; when
      boxes, bales, and jars are clattering overboard; when the wind is
      shrieking, and the men are yelling, and every plank thunders with
      trampling feet right over Jonah’s head; in all this raging tumult,
      Jonah sleeps his hideous sleep. He sees no black sky and raging sea,
      feels not the reeling timbers, and little hears he or heeds he the far
      rush of the mighty whale, which even now with open mouth is cleaving
      the seas after him. Aye, shipmates, Jonah was gone down into the sides
      of the ship—a berth in the cabin as I have taken it, and was fast
      asleep. But the frightened master comes to him, and shrieks in his dead
      ear, ‘What meanest thou, O, sleeper! arise!’ Startled from his lethargy
      by that direful cry, Jonah staggers to his feet, and stumbling to the
      deck, grasps a shroud, to look out upon the sea. But at that moment he
      is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks. Wave
      after wave thus leaps into the ship, and finding no speedy vent runs
      roaring fore and aft, till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet
      afloat. And ever, as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the
      steep gullies in the blackness overhead, aghast Jonah sees the rearing
      bowsprit pointing high upward, but soon beat downward again towards the
      tormented deep.
      
      “Terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul. In all his
      cringing attitudes, the God-fugitive is now too plainly known. The
      sailors mark him; more and more certain grow their suspicions of him,
      and at last, fully to test the truth, by referring the whole matter to
      high Heaven, they fall to casting lots, to see for whose cause this
      great tempest was upon them. The lot is Jonah’s; that discovered, then
      how furiously they mob him with their questions. ‘What is thine
      occupation? Whence comest thou? Thy country? What people? But mark now,
      my shipmates, the behavior of poor Jonah. The eager mariners but ask
      him who he is, and where from; whereas, they not only receive an answer
      to those questions, but likewise another answer to a question not put
      by them, but the unsolicited answer is forced from Jonah by the hard
      hand of God that is upon him.
      
      “‘I am a Hebrew,’ he cries—and then—‘I fear the Lord the God of Heaven
      who hath made the sea and the dry land!’ Fear him, O Jonah? Aye, well
      mightest thou fear the Lord God _then!_ Straightway, he now goes on to
      make a full confession; whereupon the mariners became more and more
      appalled, but still are pitiful. For when Jonah, not yet supplicating
      God for mercy, since he but too well knew the darkness of his
      deserts,—when wretched Jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him
      forth into the sea, for he knew that for _his_ sake this great tempest
      was upon them; they mercifully turn from him, and seek by other means
      to save the ship. But all in vain; the indignant gale howls louder;
      then, with one hand raised invokingly to God, with the other they not
      unreluctantly lay hold of Jonah.
      
      “And now behold Jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea;
      when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east, and the sea
      is still, as Jonah carries down the gale with him, leaving smooth water
      behind. He goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless
      commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into
      the yawning jaws awaiting him; and the whale shoots-to all his ivory
      teeth, like so many white bolts, upon his prison. Then Jonah prayed
      unto the Lord out of the fish’s belly. But observe his prayer, and
      learn a weighty lesson. For sinful as he is, Jonah does not weep and
      wail for direct deliverance. He feels that his dreadful punishment is
      just. He leaves all his deliverance to God, contenting himself with
      this, that spite of all his pains and pangs, he will still look towards
      His holy temple. And here, shipmates, is true and faithful repentance;
      not clamorous for pardon, but grateful for punishment. And how pleasing
      to God was this conduct in Jonah, is shown in the eventual deliverance
      of him from the sea and the whale. Shipmates, I do not place Jonah
      before you to be copied for his sin but I do place him before you as a
      model for repentance. Sin not; but if you do, take heed to repent of it
      like Jonah.”
      
      While he was speaking these words, the howling of the shrieking,
      slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher, who,
      when describing Jonah’s sea-storm, seemed tossed by a storm himself.
      His deep chest heaved as with a ground-swell; his tossed arms seemed
      the warring elements at work; and the thunders that rolled away from
      off his swarthy brow, and the light leaping from his eye, made all his
      simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them.
      
      There now came a lull in his look, as he silently turned over the
      leaves of the Book once more; and, at last, standing motionless, with
      closed eyes, for the moment, seemed communing with God and himself.
      
      But again he leaned over towards the people, and bowing his head lowly,
      with an aspect of the deepest yet manliest humility, he spake these
      words:
      
      “Shipmates, God has laid but one hand upon you; both his hands press
      upon me. I have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that
      Jonah teaches to all sinners; and therefore to ye, and still more to
      me, for I am a greater sinner than ye. And now how gladly would I come
      down from this mast-head and sit on the hatches there where you sit,
      and listen as you listen, while some one of you reads _me_ that other
      and more awful lesson which Jonah teaches to _me_, as a pilot of the
      living God. How being an anointed pilot-prophet, or speaker of true
      things, and bidden by the Lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the
      ears of a wicked Nineveh, Jonah, appalled at the hostility he should
      raise, fled from his mission, and sought to escape his duty and his God
      by taking ship at Joppa. But God is everywhere; Tarshish he never
      reached. As we have seen, God came upon him in the whale, and swallowed
      him down to living gulfs of doom, and with swift slantings tore him
      along ‘into the midst of the seas,’ where the eddying depths sucked him
      ten thousand fathoms down, and ‘the weeds were wrapped about his head,’
      and all the watery world of woe bowled over him. Yet even then beyond
      the reach of any plummet—‘out of the belly of hell’—when the whale
      grounded upon the ocean’s utmost bones, even then, God heard the
      engulphed, repenting prophet when he cried. Then God spake unto the
      fish; and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea, the whale
      came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun, and all the
      delights of air and earth; and ‘vomited out Jonah upon the dry land;’
      when the word of the Lord came a second time; and Jonah, bruised and
      beaten—his ears, like two sea-shells, still multitudinously murmuring
      of the ocean—Jonah did the Almighty’s bidding. And what was that,
      shipmates? To preach the Truth to the face of Falsehood! That was it!
      
      “This, shipmates, this is that other lesson; and woe to that pilot of
      the living God who slights it. Woe to him whom this world charms from
      Gospel duty! Woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when God
      has brewed them into a gale! Woe to him who seeks to please rather than
      to appal! Woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness! Woe
      to him who, in this world, courts not dishonor! Woe to him who would
      not be true, even though to be false were salvation! Yea, woe to him
      who, as the great Pilot Paul has it, while preaching to others is
      himself a castaway!”
      
      He dropped and fell away from himself for a moment; then lifting his
      face to them again, showed a deep joy in his eyes, as he cried out with
      a heavenly enthusiasm,—“But oh! shipmates! on the starboard hand of
      every woe, there is a sure delight; and higher the top of that delight,
      than the bottom of the woe is deep. Is not the main-truck higher than
      the kelson is low? Delight is to him—a far, far upward, and inward
      delight—who against the proud gods and commodores of this earth, ever
      stands forth his own inexorable self. Delight is to him whose strong
      arms yet support him, when the ship of this base treacherous world has
      gone down beneath him. Delight is to him, who gives no quarter in the
      truth, and kills, burns, and destroys all sin though he pluck it out
      from under the robes of Senators and Judges. Delight,—top-gallant
      delight is to him, who acknowledges no law or lord, but the Lord his
      God, and is only a patriot to heaven. Delight is to him, whom all the
      waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake
      from this sure Keel of the Ages. And eternal delight and deliciousness
      will be his, who coming to lay him down, can say with his final
      breath—O Father!—chiefly known to me by Thy rod—mortal or immortal,
      here I die. I have striven to be Thine, more than to be this world’s,
      or mine own. Yet this is nothing: I leave eternity to Thee; for what is
      man that he should live out the lifetime of his God?”
      
      He said no more, but slowly waving a benediction, covered his face with
      his hands, and so remained kneeling, till all the people had departed,
      and he was left alone in the place.
      
      
      CHAPTER 10. A Bosom Friend.
      
      Returning to the Spouter-Inn from the Chapel, I found Queequeg there
      quite alone; he having left the Chapel before the benediction some
      time. He was sitting on a bench before the fire, with his feet on the
      stove hearth, and in one hand was holding close up to his face that
      little negro idol of his; peering hard into its face, and with a
      jack-knife gently whittling away at its nose, meanwhile humming to
      himself in his heathenish way.
      
      But being now interrupted, he put up the image; and pretty soon, going
      to the table, took up a large book there, and placing it on his lap
      began counting the pages with deliberate regularity; at every fiftieth
      page—as I fancied—stopping a moment, looking vacantly around him, and
      giving utterance to a long-drawn gurgling whistle of astonishment. He
      would then begin again at the next fifty; seeming to commence at number
      one each time, as though he could not count more than fifty, and it was
      only by such a large number of fifties being found together, that his
      astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited.
      
      With much interest I sat watching him. Savage though he was, and
      hideously marred about the face—at least to my taste—his countenance
      yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable. You
      cannot hide the soul. Through all his unearthly tattooings, I thought I
      saw the traces of a simple honest heart; and in his large, deep eyes,
      fiery black and bold, there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a
      thousand devils. And besides all this, there was a certain lofty
      bearing about the Pagan, which even his uncouthness could not
      altogether maim. He looked like a man who had never cringed and never
      had had a creditor. Whether it was, too, that his head being shaved,
      his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief, and looked
      more expansive than it otherwise would, this I will not venture to
      decide; but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent
      one. It may seem ridiculous, but it reminded me of General Washington’s
      head, as seen in the popular busts of him. It had the same long
      regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows, which were
      likewise very projecting, like two long promontories thickly wooded on
      top. Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically developed.
      
      Whilst I was thus closely scanning him, half-pretending meanwhile to be
      looking out at the storm from the casement, he never heeded my
      presence, never troubled himself with so much as a single glance; but
      appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous
      book. Considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night
      previous, and especially considering the affectionate arm I had found
      thrown over me upon waking in the morning, I thought this indifference
      of his very strange. But savages are strange beings; at times you do
      not know exactly how to take them. At first they are overawing; their
      calm self-collectedness of simplicity seems a Socratic wisdom. I had
      noticed also that Queequeg never consorted at all, or but very little,
      with the other seamen in the inn. He made no advances whatever;
      appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances.
      All this struck me as mighty singular; yet, upon second thoughts, there
      was something almost sublime in it. Here was a man some twenty thousand
      miles from home, by the way of Cape Horn, that is—which was the only
      way he could get there—thrown among people as strange to him as though
      he were in the planet Jupiter; and yet he seemed entirely at his ease;
      preserving the utmost serenity; content with his own companionship;
      always equal to himself. Surely this was a touch of fine philosophy;
      though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that. But,
      perhaps, to be true philosophers, we mortals should not be conscious of
      so living or so striving. So soon as I hear that such or such a man
      gives himself out for a philosopher, I conclude that, like the
      dyspeptic old woman, he must have “broken his digester.”
      
      As I sat there in that now lonely room; the fire burning low, in that
      mild stage when, after its first intensity has warmed the air, it then
      only glows to be looked at; the evening shades and phantoms gathering
      round the casements, and peering in upon us silent, solitary twain; the
      storm booming without in solemn swells; I began to be sensible of
      strange feelings. I felt a melting in me. No more my splintered heart
      and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world. This soothing
      savage had redeemed it. There he sat, his very indifference speaking a
      nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland
      deceits. Wild he was; a very sight of sights to see; yet I began to
      feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him. And those same things that
      would have repelled most others, they were the very magnets that thus
      drew me. I’ll try a pagan friend, thought I, since Christian kindness
      has proved but hollow courtesy. I drew my bench near him, and made some
      friendly signs and hints, doing my best to talk with him meanwhile. At
      first he little noticed these advances; but presently, upon my
      referring to his last night’s hospitalities, he made out to ask me
      whether we were again to be bedfellows. I told him yes; whereat I
      thought he looked pleased, perhaps a little complimented.
      
      We then turned over the book together, and I endeavored to explain to
      him the purpose of the printing, and the meaning of the few pictures
      that were in it. Thus I soon engaged his interest; and from that we
      went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to
      be seen in this famous town. Soon I proposed a social smoke; and,
      producing his pouch and tomahawk, he quietly offered me a puff. And
      then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his, and keeping it
      regularly passing between us.
      
      If there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the Pagan’s
      breast, this pleasant, genial smoke we had, soon thawed it out, and
      left us cronies. He seemed to take to me quite as naturally and
      unbiddenly as I to him; and when our smoke was over, he pressed his
      forehead against mine, clasped me round the waist, and said that
      henceforth we were married; meaning, in his country’s phrase, that we
      were bosom friends; he would gladly die for me, if need should be. In a
      countryman, this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too
      premature, a thing to be much distrusted; but in this simple savage
      those old rules would not apply.
      
      After supper, and another social chat and smoke, we went to our room
      together. He made me a present of his embalmed head; took out his
      enormous tobacco wallet, and groping under the tobacco, drew out some
      thirty dollars in silver; then spreading them on the table, and
      mechanically dividing them into two equal portions, pushed one of them
      towards me, and said it was mine. I was going to remonstrate; but he
      silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers’ pockets. I let them stay.
      He then went about his evening prayers, took out his idol, and removed
      the paper fireboard. By certain signs and symptoms, I thought he seemed
      anxious for me to join him; but well knowing what was to follow, I
      deliberated a moment whether, in case he invited me, I would comply or
      otherwise.
      
      I was a good Christian; born and bred in the bosom of the infallible
      Presbyterian Church. How then could I unite with this wild idolator in
      worshipping his piece of wood? But what is worship? thought I. Do you
      suppose now, Ishmael, that the magnanimous God of heaven and
      earth—pagans and all included—can possibly be jealous of an
      insignificant bit of black wood? Impossible! But what is worship?—to do
      the will of God—_that_ is worship. And what is the will of God?—to do
      to my fellow man what I would have my fellow man to do to me—_that_ is
      the will of God. Now, Queequeg is my fellow man. And what do I wish
      that this Queequeg would do to me? Why, unite with me in my particular
      Presbyterian form of worship. Consequently, I must then unite with him
      in his; ergo, I must turn idolator. So I kindled the shavings; helped
      prop up the innocent little idol; offered him burnt biscuit with
      Queequeg; salamed before him twice or thrice; kissed his nose; and that
      done, we undressed and went to bed, at peace with our own consciences
      and all the world. But we did not go to sleep without some little chat.
      
      How it is I know not; but there is no place like a bed for confidential
      disclosures between friends. Man and wife, they say, there open the
      very bottom of their souls to each other; and some old couples often
      lie and chat over old times till nearly morning. Thus, then, in our
      hearts’ honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg—a cosy, loving pair.
      
      
      CHAPTER 11. Nightgown.
      
      We had lain thus in bed, chatting and napping at short intervals, and
      Queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs
      over mine, and then drawing them back; so entirely sociable and free
      and easy were we; when, at last, by reason of our confabulations, what
      little nappishness remained in us altogether departed, and we felt like
      getting up again, though day-break was yet some way down the future.
      
      Yes, we became very wakeful; so much so that our recumbent position
      began to grow wearisome, and by little and little we found ourselves
      sitting up; the clothes well tucked around us, leaning against the
      head-board with our four knees drawn up close together, and our two
      noses bending over them, as if our kneepans were warming-pans. We felt
      very nice and snug, the more so since it was so chilly out of doors;
      indeed out of bed-clothes too, seeing that there was no fire in the
      room. The more so, I say, because truly to enjoy bodily warmth, some
      small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality in this world
      that is not what it is merely by contrast. Nothing exists in itself. If
      you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable, and have been
      so a long time, then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more. But
      if, like Queequeg and me in the bed, the tip of your nose or the crown
      of your head be slightly chilled, why then, indeed, in the general
      consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm. For
      this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire,
      which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich. For the height
      of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket
      between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air. Then there
      you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal.
      
      We had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time, when all at
      once I thought I would open my eyes; for when between sheets, whether
      by day or by night, and whether asleep or awake, I have a way of always
      keeping my eyes shut, in order the more to concentrate the snugness of
      being in bed. Because no man can ever feel his own identity aright
      except his eyes be closed; as if darkness were indeed the proper
      element of our essences, though light be more congenial to our clayey
      part. Upon opening my eyes then, and coming out of my own pleasant and
      self-created darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the
      unilluminated twelve-o’clock-at-night, I experienced a disagreeable
      revulsion. Nor did I at all object to the hint from Queequeg that
      perhaps it were best to strike a light, seeing that we were so wide
      awake; and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs
      from his Tomahawk. Be it said, that though I had felt such a strong
      repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before, yet see how
      elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them.
      For now I liked nothing better than to have Queequeg smoking by me,
      even in bed, because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy
      then. I no more felt unduly concerned for the landlord’s policy of
      insurance. I was only alive to the condensed confidential
      comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend.
      With our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders, we now passed the
      Tomahawk from one to the other, till slowly there grew over us a blue
      hanging tester of smoke, illuminated by the flame of the new-lit lamp.
      
      Whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to
      far distant scenes, I know not, but he now spoke of his native island;
      and, eager to hear his history, I begged him to go on and tell it. He
      gladly complied. Though at the time I but ill comprehended not a few of
      his words, yet subsequent disclosures, when I had become more familiar
      with his broken phraseology, now enable me to present the whole story
      such as it may prove in the mere skeleton I give.
      
      
      CHAPTER 12. Biographical.
      
      Queequeg was a native of Rokovoko, an island far away to the West and
      South. It is not down in any map; true places never are.
      
      When a new-hatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a
      grass clout, followed by the nibbling goats, as if he were a green
      sapling; even then, in Queequeg’s ambitious soul, lurked a strong
      desire to see something more of Christendom than a specimen whaler or
      two. His father was a High Chief, a King; his uncle a High Priest; and
      on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of
      unconquerable warriors. There was excellent blood in his veins—royal
      stuff; though sadly vitiated, I fear, by the cannibal propensity he
      nourished in his untutored youth.
      
      A Sag Harbor ship visited his father’s bay, and Queequeg sought a
      passage to Christian lands. But the ship, having her full complement of
      seamen, spurned his suit; and not all the King his father’s influence
      could prevail. But Queequeg vowed a vow. Alone in his canoe, he paddled
      off to a distant strait, which he knew the ship must pass through when
      she quitted the island. On one side was a coral reef; on the other a
      low tongue of land, covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into
      the water. Hiding his canoe, still afloat, among these thickets, with
      its prow seaward, he sat down in the stern, paddle low in hand; and
      when the ship was gliding by, like a flash he darted out; gained her
      side; with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe;
      climbed up the chains; and throwing himself at full length upon the
      deck, grappled a ring-bolt there, and swore not to let it go, though
      hacked in pieces.
      
      In vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard; suspended a
      cutlass over his naked wrists; Queequeg was the son of a King, and
      Queequeg budged not. Struck by his desperate dauntlessness, and his
      wild desire to visit Christendom, the captain at last relented, and
      told him he might make himself at home. But this fine young savage—this
      sea Prince of Wales, never saw the Captain’s cabin. They put him down
      among the sailors, and made a whaleman of him. But like Czar Peter
      content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities, Queequeg disdained
      no seeming ignominy, if thereby he might happily gain the power of
      enlightening his untutored countrymen. For at bottom—so he told me—he
      was actuated by a profound desire to learn among the Christians, the
      arts whereby to make his people still happier than they were; and more
      than that, still better than they were. But, alas! the practices of
      whalemen soon convinced him that even Christians could be both
      miserable and wicked; infinitely more so, than all his father’s
      heathens. Arrived at last in old Sag Harbor; and seeing what the
      sailors did there; and then going on to Nantucket, and seeing how they
      spent their wages in _that_ place also, poor Queequeg gave it up for
      lost. Thought he, it’s a wicked world in all meridians; I’ll die a
      pagan.
      
      And thus an old idolator at heart, he yet lived among these Christians,
      wore their clothes, and tried to talk their gibberish. Hence the queer
      ways about him, though now some time from home.
      
      By hints, I asked him whether he did not propose going back, and having
      a coronation; since he might now consider his father dead and gone, he
      being very old and feeble at the last accounts. He answered no, not
      yet; and added that he was fearful Christianity, or rather Christians,
      had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty
      pagan Kings before him. But by and by, he said, he would return,—as
      soon as he felt himself baptized again. For the nonce, however, he
      proposed to sail about, and sow his wild oats in all four oceans. They
      had made a harpooneer of him, and that barbed iron was in lieu of a
      sceptre now.
      
      I asked him what might be his immediate purpose, touching his future
      movements. He answered, to go to sea again, in his old vocation. Upon
      this, I told him that whaling was my own design, and informed him of my
      intention to sail out of Nantucket, as being the most promising port
      for an adventurous whaleman to embark from. He at once resolved to
      accompany me to that island, ship aboard the same vessel, get into the
      same watch, the same boat, the same mess with me, in short to share my
      every hap; with both my hands in his, boldly dip into the Potluck of
      both worlds. To all this I joyously assented; for besides the affection
      I now felt for Queequeg, he was an experienced harpooneer, and as such,
      could not fail to be of great usefulness to one, who, like me, was
      wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling, though well acquainted
      with the sea, as known to merchant seamen.
      
      His story being ended with his pipe’s last dying puff, Queequeg
      embraced me, pressed his forehead against mine, and blowing out the
      light, we rolled over from each other, this way and that, and very soon
      were sleeping.
      
      
      CHAPTER 13. Wheelbarrow.
      
      Next morning, Monday, after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber,
      for a block, I settled my own and comrade’s bill; using, however, my
      comrade’s money. The grinning landlord, as well as the boarders, seemed
      amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between
      me and Queequeg—especially as Peter Coffin’s cock and bull stories
      about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person
      whom I now companied with.
      
      We borrowed a wheelbarrow, and embarking our things, including my own
      poor carpet-bag, and Queequeg’s canvas sack and hammock, away we went
      down to “the Moss,” the little Nantucket packet schooner moored at the
      wharf. As we were going along the people stared; not at Queequeg so
      much—for they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their
      streets,—but at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms. But we
      heeded them not, going along wheeling the barrow by turns, and Queequeg
      now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs. I
      asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore, and
      whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons. To this, in
      substance, he replied, that though what I hinted was true enough, yet
      he had a particular affection for his own harpoon, because it was of
      assured stuff, well tried in many a mortal combat, and deeply intimate
      with the hearts of whales. In short, like many inland reapers and
      mowers, who go into the farmers’ meadows armed with their own
      scythes—though in no wise obliged to furnish them—even so, Queequeg,
      for his own private reasons, preferred his own harpoon.
      
      Shifting the barrow from my hand to his, he told me a funny story about
      the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen. It was in Sag Harbor. The
      owners of his ship, it seems, had lent him one, in which to carry his
      heavy chest to his boarding house. Not to seem ignorant about the
      thing—though in truth he was entirely so, concerning the precise way in
      which to manage the barrow—Queequeg puts his chest upon it; lashes it
      fast; and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf. “Why,”
      said I, “Queequeg, you might have known better than that, one would
      think. Didn’t the people laugh?”
      
      Upon this, he told me another story. The people of his island of
      Rokovoko, it seems, at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water
      of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl; and
      this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided
      mat where the feast is held. Now a certain grand merchant ship once
      touched at Rokovoko, and its commander—from all accounts, a very
      stately punctilious gentleman, at least for a sea captain—this
      commander was invited to the wedding feast of Queequeg’s sister, a
      pretty young princess just turned of ten. Well; when all the wedding
      guests were assembled at the bride’s bamboo cottage, this Captain
      marches in, and being assigned the post of honor, placed himself over
      against the punchbowl, and between the High Priest and his majesty the
      King, Queequeg’s father. Grace being said,—for those people have their
      grace as well as we—though Queequeg told me that unlike us, who at such
      times look downwards to our platters, they, on the contrary, copying
      the ducks, glance upwards to the great Giver of all feasts—Grace, I
      say, being said, the High Priest opens the banquet by the immemorial
      ceremony of the island; that is, dipping his consecrated and
      consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage
      circulates. Seeing himself placed next the Priest, and noting the
      ceremony, and thinking himself—being Captain of a ship—as having plain
      precedence over a mere island King, especially in the King’s own
      house—the Captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the
      punchbowl;—taking it I suppose for a huge finger-glass. “Now,” said
      Queequeg, “what you tink now?—Didn’t our people laugh?”
      
      At last, passage paid, and luggage safe, we stood on board the
      schooner. Hoisting sail, it glided down the Acushnet river. On one
      side, New Bedford rose in terraces of streets, their ice-covered trees
      all glittering in the clear, cold air. Huge hills and mountains of
      casks on casks were piled upon her wharves, and side by side the
      world-wandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last; while
      from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers, with blended noises
      of fires and forges to melt the pitch, all betokening that new cruises
      were on the start; that one most perilous and long voyage ended, only
      begins a second; and a second ended, only begins a third, and so on,
      for ever and for aye. Such is the endlessness, yea, the intolerableness
      of all earthly effort.
      
      Gaining the more open water, the bracing breeze waxed fresh; the little
      Moss tossed the quick foam from her bows, as a young colt his
      snortings. How I snuffed that Tartar air!—how I spurned that turnpike
      earth!—that common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish
      heels and hoofs; and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea
      which will permit no records.
      
      At the same foam-fountain, Queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me.
      His dusky nostrils swelled apart; he showed his filed and pointed
      teeth. On, on we flew; and our offing gained, the Moss did homage to
      the blast; ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the Sultan.
      Sideways leaning, we sideways darted; every ropeyarn tingling like a
      wire; the two tall masts buckling like Indian canes in land tornadoes.
      So full of this reeling scene were we, as we stood by the plunging
      bowsprit, that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of
      the passengers, a lubber-like assembly, who marvelled that two fellow
      beings should be so companionable; as though a white man were anything
      more dignified than a whitewashed negro. But there were some boobies
      and bumpkins there, who, by their intense greenness, must have come
      from the heart and centre of all verdure. Queequeg caught one of these
      young saplings mimicking him behind his back. I thought the bumpkin’s
      hour of doom was come. Dropping his harpoon, the brawny savage caught
      him in his arms, and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength,
      sent him high up bodily into the air; then slightly tapping his stern
      in mid-somerset, the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet,
      while Queequeg, turning his back upon him, lighted his tomahawk pipe
      and passed it to me for a puff.
      
      “Capting! Capting!” yelled the bumpkin, running towards that officer;
      “Capting, Capting, here’s the devil.”
      
      “Hallo, _you_ sir,” cried the Captain, a gaunt rib of the sea, stalking
      up to Queequeg, “what in thunder do you mean by that? Don’t you know
      you might have killed that chap?”
      
      “What him say?” said Queequeg, as he mildly turned to me.
      
      “He say,” said I, “that you came near kill-e that man there,” pointing
      to the still shivering greenhorn.
      
      “Kill-e,” cried Queequeg, twisting his tattooed face into an unearthly
      expression of disdain, “ah! him bevy small-e fish-e; Queequeg no kill-e
      so small-e fish-e; Queequeg kill-e big whale!”
      
      “Look you,” roared the Captain, “I’ll kill-e _you_, you cannibal, if
      you try any more of your tricks aboard here; so mind your eye.”
      
      But it so happened just then, that it was high time for the Captain to
      mind his own eye. The prodigious strain upon the main-sail had parted
      the weather-sheet, and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to
      side, completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck. The poor
      fellow whom Queequeg had handled so roughly, was swept overboard; all
      hands were in a panic; and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it,
      seemed madness. It flew from right to left, and back again, almost in
      one ticking of a watch, and every instant seemed on the point of
      snapping into splinters. Nothing was done, and nothing seemed capable
      of being done; those on deck rushed towards the bows, and stood eyeing
      the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale. In the
      midst of this consternation, Queequeg dropped deftly to his knees, and
      crawling under the path of the boom, whipped hold of a rope, secured
      one end to the bulwarks, and then flinging the other like a lasso,
      caught it round the boom as it swept over his head, and at the next
      jerk, the spar was that way trapped, and all was safe. The schooner was
      run into the wind, and while the hands were clearing away the stern
      boat, Queequeg, stripped to the waist, darted from the side with a long
      living arc of a leap. For three minutes or more he was seen swimming
      like a dog, throwing his long arms straight out before him, and by
      turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam. I
      looked at the grand and glorious fellow, but saw no one to be saved.
      The greenhorn had gone down. Shooting himself perpendicularly from the
      water, Queequeg, now took an instant’s glance around him, and seeming
      to see just how matters were, dived down and disappeared. A few minutes
      more, and he rose again, one arm still striking out, and with the other
      dragging a lifeless form. The boat soon picked them up. The poor
      bumpkin was restored. All hands voted Queequeg a noble trump; the
      captain begged his pardon. From that hour I clove to Queequeg like a
      barnacle; yea, till poor Queequeg took his last long dive.
      
      Was there ever such unconsciousness? He did not seem to think that he
      at all deserved a medal from the Humane and Magnanimous Societies. He
      only asked for water—fresh water—something to wipe the brine off; that
      done, he put on dry clothes, lighted his pipe, and leaning against the
      bulwarks, and mildly eyeing those around him, seemed to be saying to
      himself—“It’s a mutual, joint-stock world, in all meridians. We
      cannibals must help these Christians.”
      
      
      CHAPTER 14. Nantucket.
      
      Nothing more happened on the passage worthy the mentioning; so, after a
      fine run, we safely arrived in Nantucket.
      
      Nantucket! Take out your map and look at it. See what a real corner of
      the world it occupies; how it stands there, away off shore, more lonely
      than the Eddystone lighthouse. Look at it—a mere hillock, and elbow of
      sand; all beach, without a background. There is more sand there than
      you would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper. Some
      gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there, they
      don’t grow naturally; that they import Canada thistles; that they have
      to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask; that
      pieces of wood in Nantucket are carried about like bits of the true
      cross in Rome; that people there plant toadstools before their houses,
      to get under the shade in summer time; that one blade of grass makes an
      oasis, three blades in a day’s walk a prairie; that they wear quicksand
      shoes, something like Laplander snow-shoes; that they are so shut up,
      belted about, every way inclosed, surrounded, and made an utter island
      of by the ocean, that to their very chairs and tables small clams will
      sometimes be found adhering, as to the backs of sea turtles. But these
      extravaganzas only show that Nantucket is no Illinois.
      
      Look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was
      settled by the red-men. Thus goes the legend. In olden times an eagle
      swooped down upon the New England coast, and carried off an infant
      Indian in his talons. With loud lament the parents saw their child
      borne out of sight over the wide waters. They resolved to follow in the
      same direction. Setting out in their canoes, after a perilous passage
      they discovered the island, and there they found an empty ivory
      casket,—the poor little Indian’s skeleton.
      
      What wonder, then, that these Nantucketers, born on a beach, should
      take to the sea for a livelihood! They first caught crabs and quohogs
      in the sand; grown bolder, they waded out with nets for mackerel; more
      experienced, they pushed off in boats and captured cod; and at last,
      launching a navy of great ships on the sea, explored this watery world;
      put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it; peeped in at
      Behring’s Straits; and in all seasons and all oceans declared
      everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the
      flood; most monstrous and most mountainous! That Himmalehan, salt-sea
      Mastodon, clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power, that
      his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and
      malicious assaults!
      
      And thus have these naked Nantucketers, these sea hermits, issuing from
      their ant-hill in the sea, overrun and conquered the watery world like
      so many Alexanders; parcelling out among them the Atlantic, Pacific,
      and Indian oceans, as the three pirate powers did Poland. Let America
      add Mexico to Texas, and pile Cuba upon Canada; let the English
      overswarm all India, and hang out their blazing banner from the sun;
      two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the Nantucketer’s. For the sea
      is his; he owns it, as Emperors own empires; other seamen having but a
      right of way through it. Merchant ships are but extension bridges;
      armed ones but floating forts; even pirates and privateers, though
      following the sea as highwaymen the road, they but plunder other ships,
      other fragments of the land like themselves, without seeking to draw
      their living from the bottomless deep itself. The Nantucketer, he alone
      resides and riots on the sea; he alone, in Bible language, goes down to
      it in ships; to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation.
      _There_ is his home; _there_ lies his business, which a Noah’s flood
      would not interrupt, though it overwhelmed all the millions in China.
      He lives on the sea, as prairie cocks in the prairie; he hides among
      the waves, he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the Alps. For years
      he knows not the land; so that when he comes to it at last, it smells
      like another world, more strangely than the moon would to an Earthsman.
      With the landless gull, that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to
      sleep between billows; so at nightfall, the Nantucketer, out of sight
      of land, furls his sails, and lays him to his rest, while under his
      very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales.
      
      
      CHAPTER 15. Chowder.
      
      It was quite late in the evening when the little Moss came snugly to
      anchor, and Queequeg and I went ashore; so we could attend to no
      business that day, at least none but a supper and a bed. The landlord
      of the Spouter-Inn had recommended us to his cousin Hosea Hussey of the
      Try Pots, whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept
      hotels in all Nantucket, and moreover he had assured us that Cousin
      Hosea, as he called him, was famous for his chowders. In short, he
      plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try pot-luck
      at the Try Pots. But the directions he had given us about keeping a
      yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to
      the larboard, and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a
      corner three points to the starboard, and that done, then ask the first
      man we met where the place was: these crooked directions of his very
      much puzzled us at first, especially as, at the outset, Queequeg
      insisted that the yellow warehouse—our first point of departure—must be
      left on the larboard hand, whereas I had understood Peter Coffin to say
      it was on the starboard. However, by dint of beating about a little in
      the dark, and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to
      inquire the way, we at last came to something which there was no
      mistaking.
      
      Two enormous wooden pots painted black, and suspended by asses’ ears,
      swung from the cross-trees of an old top-mast, planted in front of an
      old doorway. The horns of the cross-trees were sawed off on the other
      side, so that this old top-mast looked not a little like a gallows.
      Perhaps I was over sensitive to such impressions at the time, but I
      could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving. A sort
      of crick was in my neck as I gazed up to the two remaining horns; yes,
      _two_ of them, one for Queequeg, and one for me. It’s ominous, thinks
      I. A Coffin my Innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port;
      tombstones staring at me in the whalemen’s chapel; and here a gallows!
      and a pair of prodigious black pots too! Are these last throwing out
      oblique hints touching Tophet?
      
      I was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman
      with yellow hair and a yellow gown, standing in the porch of the inn,
      under a dull red lamp swinging there, that looked much like an injured
      eye, and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen
      shirt.
      
      “Get along with ye,” said she to the man, “or I’ll be combing ye!”
      
      “Come on, Queequeg,” said I, “all right. There’s Mrs. Hussey.”
      
      And so it turned out; Mr. Hosea Hussey being from home, but leaving
      Mrs. Hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs. Upon
      making known our desires for a supper and a bed, Mrs. Hussey,
      postponing further scolding for the present, ushered us into a little
      room, and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently
      concluded repast, turned round to us and said—“Clam or Cod?”
      
      “What’s that about Cods, ma’am?” said I, with much politeness.
      
      “Clam or Cod?” she repeated.
      
      “A clam for supper? a cold clam; is _that_ what you mean, Mrs. Hussey?”
      says I, “but that’s a rather cold and clammy reception in the winter
      time, ain’t it, Mrs. Hussey?”
      
      But being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple
      Shirt, who was waiting for it in the entry, and seeming to hear nothing
      but the word “clam,” Mrs. Hussey hurried towards an open door leading
      to the kitchen, and bawling out “clam for two,” disappeared.
      
      “Queequeg,” said I, “do you think that we can make out a supper for us
      both on one clam?”
      
      However, a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the
      apparently cheerless prospect before us. But when that smoking chowder
      came in, the mystery was delightfully explained. Oh, sweet friends!
      hearken to me. It was made of small juicy clams, scarcely bigger than
      hazel nuts, mixed with pounded ship biscuit, and salted pork cut up
      into little flakes; the whole enriched with butter, and plentifully
      seasoned with pepper and salt. Our appetites being sharpened by the
      frosty voyage, and in particular, Queequeg seeing his favourite fishing
      food before him, and the chowder being surpassingly excellent, we
      despatched it with great expedition: when leaning back a moment and
      bethinking me of Mrs. Hussey’s clam and cod announcement, I thought I
      would try a little experiment. Stepping to the kitchen door, I uttered
      the word “cod” with great emphasis, and resumed my seat. In a few
      moments the savoury steam came forth again, but with a different
      flavor, and in good time a fine cod-chowder was placed before us.
      
      We resumed business; and while plying our spoons in the bowl, thinks I
      to myself, I wonder now if this here has any effect on the head? What’s
      that stultifying saying about chowder-headed people? “But look,
      Queequeg, ain’t that a live eel in your bowl? Where’s your harpoon?”
      
      Fishiest of all fishy places was the Try Pots, which well deserved its
      name; for the pots there were always boiling chowders. Chowder for
      breakfast, and chowder for dinner, and chowder for supper, till you
      began to look for fish-bones coming through your clothes. The area
      before the house was paved with clam-shells. Mrs. Hussey wore a
      polished necklace of codfish vertebra; and Hosea Hussey had his account
      books bound in superior old shark-skin. There was a fishy flavor to the
      milk, too, which I could not at all account for, till one morning
      happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermen’s
      boats, I saw Hosea’s brindled cow feeding on fish remnants, and
      marching along the sand with each foot in a cod’s decapitated head,
      looking very slip-shod, I assure ye.
      
      Supper concluded, we received a lamp, and directions from Mrs. Hussey
      concerning the nearest way to bed; but, as Queequeg was about to
      precede me up the stairs, the lady reached forth her arm, and demanded
      his harpoon; she allowed no harpoon in her chambers. “Why not?” said I;
      “every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoon—but why not?” “Because
      it’s dangerous,” says she. “Ever since young Stiggs coming from that
      unfort’nt v’y’ge of his, when he was gone four years and a half, with
      only three barrels of _ile_, was found dead in my first floor back,
      with his harpoon in his side; ever since then I allow no boarders to
      take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night. So, Mr. Queequeg”
      (for she had learned his name), “I will just take this here iron, and
      keep it for you till morning. But the chowder; clam or cod to-morrow
      for breakfast, men?”
      
      “Both,” says I; “and let’s have a couple of smoked herring by way of
      variety.”
      
      
      CHAPTER 16. The Ship.
      
      In bed we concocted our plans for the morrow. But to my surprise and no
      small concern, Queequeg now gave me to understand, that he had been
      diligently consulting Yojo—the name of his black little god—and Yojo
      had told him two or three times over, and strongly insisted upon it
      everyway, that instead of our going together among the whaling-fleet in
      harbor, and in concert selecting our craft; instead of this, I say,
      Yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest
      wholly with me, inasmuch as Yojo purposed befriending us; and, in order
      to do so, had already pitched upon a vessel, which, if left to myself,
      I, Ishmael, should infallibly light upon, for all the world as though
      it had turned out by chance; and in that vessel I must immediately ship
      myself, for the present irrespective of Queequeg.
      
      I have forgotten to mention that, in many things, Queequeg placed great
      confidence in the excellence of Yojo’s judgment and surprising forecast
      of things; and cherished Yojo with considerable esteem, as a rather
      good sort of god, who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole, but in
      all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs.
      
      Now, this plan of Queequeg’s, or rather Yojo’s, touching the selection
      of our craft; I did not like that plan at all. I had not a little
      relied upon Queequeg’s sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to
      carry us and our fortunes securely. But as all my remonstrances
      produced no effect upon Queequeg, I was obliged to acquiesce; and
      accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined
      rushing sort of energy and vigor, that should quickly settle that
      trifling little affair. Next morning early, leaving Queequeg shut up
      with Yojo in our little bedroom—for it seemed that it was some sort of
      Lent or Ramadan, or day of fasting, humiliation, and prayer with
      Queequeg and Yojo that day; _how_ it was I never could find out, for,
      though I applied myself to it several times, I never could master his
      liturgies and XXXIX Articles—leaving Queequeg, then, fasting on his
      tomahawk pipe, and Yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of
      shavings, I sallied out among the shipping. After much prolonged
      sauntering and many random inquiries, I learnt that there were three
      ships up for three-years’ voyages—The Devil-dam, the Tit-bit, and the
      Pequod. _Devil-Dam_, I do not know the origin of; _Tit-bit_ is obvious;
      _Pequod_, you will no doubt remember, was the name of a celebrated
      tribe of Massachusetts Indians; now extinct as the ancient Medes. I
      peered and pryed about the Devil-dam; from her, hopped over to the
      Tit-bit; and finally, going on board the Pequod, looked around her for
      a moment, and then decided that this was the very ship for us.
      
      You may have seen many a quaint craft in your day, for aught I
      know;—square-toed luggers; mountainous Japanese junks; butter-box
      galliots, and what not; but take my word for it, you never saw such a
      rare old craft as this same rare old Pequod. She was a ship of the old
      school, rather small if anything; with an old-fashioned claw-footed
      look about her. Long seasoned and weather-stained in the typhoons and
      calms of all four oceans, her old hull’s complexion was darkened like a
      French grenadier’s, who has alike fought in Egypt and Siberia. Her
      venerable bows looked bearded. Her masts—cut somewhere on the coast of
      Japan, where her original ones were lost overboard in a gale—her masts
      stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of Cologne. Her
      ancient decks were worn and wrinkled, like the pilgrim-worshipped
      flag-stone in Canterbury Cathedral where Becket bled. But to all these
      her old antiquities, were added new and marvellous features, pertaining
      to the wild business that for more than half a century she had
      followed. Old Captain Peleg, many years her chief-mate, before he
      commanded another vessel of his own, and now a retired seaman, and one
      of the principal owners of the Pequod,—this old Peleg, during the term
      of his chief-mateship, had built upon her original grotesqueness, and
      inlaid it, all over, with a quaintness both of material and device,
      unmatched by anything except it be Thorkill-Hake’s carved buckler or
      bedstead. She was apparelled like any barbaric Ethiopian emperor, his
      neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory. She was a thing of
      trophies. A cannibal of a craft, tricking herself forth in the chased
      bones of her enemies. All round, her unpanelled, open bulwarks were
      garnished like one continuous jaw, with the long sharp teeth of the
      sperm whale, inserted there for pins, to fasten her old hempen thews
      and tendons to. Those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood,
      but deftly travelled over sheaves of sea-ivory. Scorning a turnstile
      wheel at her reverend helm, she sported there a tiller; and that tiller
      was in one mass, curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her
      hereditary foe. The helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest,
      felt like the Tartar, when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching
      its jaw. A noble craft, but somehow a most melancholy! All noble things
      are touched with that.
      
      Now when I looked about the quarter-deck, for some one having
      authority, in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage, at
      first I saw nobody; but I could not well overlook a strange sort of
      tent, or rather wigwam, pitched a little behind the main-mast. It
      seemed only a temporary erection used in port. It was of a conical
      shape, some ten feet high; consisting of the long, huge slabs of limber
      black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the
      right-whale. Planted with their broad ends on the deck, a circle of
      these slabs laced together, mutually sloped towards each other, and at
      the apex united in a tufted point, where the loose hairy fibres waved
      to and fro like the top-knot on some old Pottowottamie Sachem’s head. A
      triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship, so that the
      insider commanded a complete view forward.
      
      And half concealed in this queer tenement, I at length found one who by
      his aspect seemed to have authority; and who, it being noon, and the
      ship’s work suspended, was now enjoying respite from the burden of
      command. He was seated on an old-fashioned oaken chair, wriggling all
      over with curious carving; and the bottom of which was formed of a
      stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was
      constructed.
      
      There was nothing so very particular, perhaps, about the appearance of
      the elderly man I saw; he was brown and brawny, like most old seamen,
      and heavily rolled up in blue pilot-cloth, cut in the Quaker style;
      only there was a fine and almost microscopic net-work of the minutest
      wrinkles interlacing round his eyes, which must have arisen from his
      continual sailings in many hard gales, and always looking to
      windward;—for this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed
      together. Such eye-wrinkles are very effectual in a scowl.
      
      “Is this the Captain of the Pequod?” said I, advancing to the door of
      the tent.
      
      “Supposing it be the captain of the Pequod, what dost thou want of
      him?” he demanded.
      
      “I was thinking of shipping.”
      
      “Thou wast, wast thou? I see thou art no Nantucketer—ever been in a
      stove boat?”
      
      “No, Sir, I never have.”
      
      “Dost know nothing at all about whaling, I dare say—eh?
      
      “Nothing, Sir; but I have no doubt I shall soon learn. I’ve been
      several voyages in the merchant service, and I think that—”
      
      “Merchant service be damned. Talk not that lingo to me. Dost see that
      leg?—I’ll take that leg away from thy stern, if ever thou talkest of
      the marchant service to me again. Marchant service indeed! I suppose
      now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant
      ships. But flukes! man, what makes thee want to go a whaling, eh?—it
      looks a little suspicious, don’t it, eh?—Hast not been a pirate, hast
      thou?—Didst not rob thy last Captain, didst thou?—Dost not think of
      murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea?”
      
      I protested my innocence of these things. I saw that under the mask of
      these half humorous innuendoes, this old seaman, as an insulated
      Quakerish Nantucketer, was full of his insular prejudices, and rather
      distrustful of all aliens, unless they hailed from Cape Cod or the
      Vineyard.
      
      “But what takes thee a-whaling? I want to know that before I think of
      shipping ye.”
      
      “Well, sir, I want to see what whaling is. I want to see the world.”
      
      “Want to see what whaling is, eh? Have ye clapped eye on Captain Ahab?”
      
      “Who is Captain Ahab, sir?”
      
      “Aye, aye, I thought so. Captain Ahab is the Captain of this ship.”
      
      “I am mistaken then. I thought I was speaking to the Captain himself.”
      
      “Thou art speaking to Captain Peleg—that’s who ye are speaking to,
      young man. It belongs to me and Captain Bildad to see the Pequod fitted
      out for the voyage, and supplied with all her needs, including crew. We
      are part owners and agents. But as I was going to say, if thou wantest
      to know what whaling is, as thou tellest ye do, I can put ye in a way
      of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it, past backing out. Clap
      eye on Captain Ahab, young man, and thou wilt find that he has only one
      leg.”
      
      “What do you mean, sir? Was the other one lost by a whale?”
      
      “Lost by a whale! Young man, come nearer to me: it was devoured, chewed
      up, crunched by the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a
      boat!—ah, ah!”
      
      I was a little alarmed by his energy, perhaps also a little touched at
      the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation, but said as calmly as I
      could, “What you say is no doubt true enough, sir; but how could I know
      there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale, though indeed
      I might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident.”
      
      “Look ye now, young man, thy lungs are a sort of soft, d’ye see; thou
      dost not talk shark a bit. _Sure_, ye’ve been to sea before now; sure
      of that?”
      
      “Sir,” said I, “I thought I told you that I had been four voyages in
      the merchant—”
      
      “Hard down out of that! Mind what I said about the marchant
      service—don’t aggravate me—I won’t have it. But let us understand each
      other. I have given thee a hint about what whaling is; do ye yet feel
      inclined for it?”
      
      “I do, sir.”
      
      “Very good. Now, art thou the man to pitch a harpoon down a live
      whale’s throat, and then jump after it? Answer, quick!”
      
      “I am, sir, if it should be positively indispensable to do so; not to
      be got rid of, that is; which I don’t take to be the fact.”
      
      “Good again. Now then, thou not only wantest to go a-whaling, to find
      out by experience what whaling is, but ye also want to go in order to
      see the world? Was not that what ye said? I thought so. Well then, just
      step forward there, and take a peep over the weather-bow, and then back
      to me and tell me what ye see there.”
      
      For a moment I stood a little puzzled by this curious request, not
      knowing exactly how to take it, whether humorously or in earnest. But
      concentrating all his crow’s feet into one scowl, Captain Peleg started
      me on the errand.
      
      Going forward and glancing over the weather bow, I perceived that the
      ship swinging to her anchor with the flood-tide, was now obliquely
      pointing towards the open ocean. The prospect was unlimited, but
      exceedingly monotonous and forbidding; not the slightest variety that I
      could see.
      
      “Well, what’s the report?” said Peleg when I came back; “what did ye
      see?”
      
      “Not much,” I replied—“nothing but water; considerable horizon though,
      and there’s a squall coming up, I think.”
      
      “Well, what does thou think then of seeing the world? Do ye wish to go
      round Cape Horn to see any more of it, eh? Can’t ye see the world where
      you stand?”
      
      I was a little staggered, but go a-whaling I must, and I would; and the
      Pequod was as good a ship as any—I thought the best—and all this I now
      repeated to Peleg. Seeing me so determined, he expressed his
      willingness to ship me.
      
      “And thou mayest as well sign the papers right off,” he added—“come
      along with ye.” And so saying, he led the way below deck into the
      cabin.
      
      Seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and
      surprising figure. It turned out to be Captain Bildad, who along with
      Captain Peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel; the other
      shares, as is sometimes the case in these ports, being held by a crowd
      of old annuitants; widows, fatherless children, and chancery wards;
      each owning about the value of a timber head, or a foot of plank, or a
      nail or two in the ship. People in Nantucket invest their money in
      whaling vessels, the same way that you do yours in approved state
      stocks bringing in good interest.
      
      Now, Bildad, like Peleg, and indeed many other Nantucketers, was a
      Quaker, the island having been originally settled by that sect; and to
      this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the
      peculiarities of the Quaker, only variously and anomalously modified by
      things altogether alien and heterogeneous. For some of these same
      Quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whale-hunters. They
      are fighting Quakers; they are Quakers with a vengeance.
      
      So that there are instances among them of men, who, named with
      Scripture names—a singularly common fashion on the island—and in
      childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the
      Quaker idiom; still, from the audacious, daring, and boundless
      adventure of their subsequent lives, strangely blend with these
      unoutgrown peculiarities, a thousand bold dashes of character, not
      unworthy a Scandinavian sea-king, or a poetical Pagan Roman. And when
      these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force, with a
      globular brain and a ponderous heart; who has also by the stillness and
      seclusion of many long night-watches in the remotest waters, and
      beneath constellations never seen here at the north, been led to think
      untraditionally and independently; receiving all nature’s sweet or
      savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding
      breast, and thereby chiefly, but with some help from accidental
      advantages, to learn a bold and nervous lofty language—that man makes
      one in a whole nation’s census—a mighty pageant creature, formed for
      noble tragedies. Nor will it at all detract from him, dramatically
      regarded, if either by birth or other circumstances, he have what seems
      a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature. For
      all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness. Be
      sure of this, O young ambition, all mortal greatness is but disease.
      But, as yet we have not to do with such an one, but with quite another;
      and still a man, who, if indeed peculiar, it only results again from
      another phase of the Quaker, modified by individual circumstances.
      
      Like Captain Peleg, Captain Bildad was a well-to-do, retired whaleman.
      But unlike Captain Peleg—who cared not a rush for what are called
      serious things, and indeed deemed those self-same serious things the
      veriest of all trifles—Captain Bildad had not only been originally
      educated according to the strictest sect of Nantucket Quakerism, but
      all his subsequent ocean life, and the sight of many unclad, lovely
      island creatures, round the Horn—all that had not moved this native
      born Quaker one single jot, had not so much as altered one angle of his
      vest. Still, for all this immutableness, was there some lack of common
      consistency about worthy Captain Bildad. Though refusing, from
      conscientious scruples, to bear arms against land invaders, yet himself
      had illimitably invaded the Atlantic and Pacific; and though a sworn
      foe to human bloodshed, yet had he in his straight-bodied coat, spilled
      tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore. How now in the contemplative evening
      of his days, the pious Bildad reconciled these things in the
      reminiscence, I do not know; but it did not seem to concern him much,
      and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible
      conclusion that a man’s religion is one thing, and this practical world
      quite another. This world pays dividends. Rising from a little
      cabin-boy in short clothes of the drabbest drab, to a harpooneer in a
      broad shad-bellied waistcoat; from that becoming boat-header,
      chief-mate, and captain, and finally a ship owner; Bildad, as I hinted
      before, had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from
      active life at the goodly age of sixty, and dedicating his remaining
      days to the quiet receiving of his well-earned income.
      
      Now, Bildad, I am sorry to say, had the reputation of being an
      incorrigible old hunks, and in his sea-going days, a bitter, hard
      task-master. They told me in Nantucket, though it certainly seems a
      curious story, that when he sailed the old Categut whaleman, his crew,
      upon arriving home, were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital,
      sore exhausted and worn out. For a pious man, especially for a Quaker,
      he was certainly rather hard-hearted, to say the least. He never used
      to swear, though, at his men, they said; but somehow he got an
      inordinate quantity of cruel, unmitigated hard work out of them. When
      Bildad was a chief-mate, to have his drab-coloured eye intently looking
      at you, made you feel completely nervous, till you could clutch
      something—a hammer or a marling-spike, and go to work like mad, at
      something or other, never mind what. Indolence and idleness perished
      before him. His own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian
      character. On his long, gaunt body, he carried no spare flesh, no
      superfluous beard, his chin having a soft, economical nap to it, like
      the worn nap of his broad-brimmed hat.
      
      Such, then, was the person that I saw seated on the transom when I
      followed Captain Peleg down into the cabin. The space between the decks
      was small; and there, bolt-upright, sat old Bildad, who always sat so,
      and never leaned, and this to save his coat tails. His broad-brim was
      placed beside him; his legs were stiffly crossed; his drab vesture was
      buttoned up to his chin; and spectacles on nose, he seemed absorbed in
      reading from a ponderous volume.
      
      “Bildad,” cried Captain Peleg, “at it again, Bildad, eh? Ye have been
      studying those Scriptures, now, for the last thirty years, to my
      certain knowledge. How far ye got, Bildad?”
      
      As if long habituated to such profane talk from his old shipmate,
      Bildad, without noticing his present irreverence, quietly looked up,
      and seeing me, glanced again inquiringly towards Peleg.
      
      “He says he’s our man, Bildad,” said Peleg, “he wants to ship.”
      
      “Dost thee?” said Bildad, in a hollow tone, and turning round to me.
      
      “I _dost_,” said I unconsciously, he was so intense a Quaker.
      
      “What do ye think of him, Bildad?” said Peleg.
      
      “He’ll do,” said Bildad, eyeing me, and then went on spelling away at
      his book in a mumbling tone quite audible.
      
      I thought him the queerest old Quaker I ever saw, especially as Peleg,
      his friend and old shipmate, seemed such a blusterer. But I said
      nothing, only looking round me sharply. Peleg now threw open a chest,
      and drawing forth the ship’s articles, placed pen and ink before him,
      and seated himself at a little table. I began to think it was high time
      to settle with myself at what terms I would be willing to engage for
      the voyage. I was already aware that in the whaling business they paid
      no wages; but all hands, including the captain, received certain shares
      of the profits called _lays_, and that these lays were proportioned to
      the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the
      ship’s company. I was also aware that being a green hand at whaling, my
      own lay would not be very large; but considering that I was used to the
      sea, could steer a ship, splice a rope, and all that, I made no doubt
      that from all I had heard I should be offered at least the 275th
      lay—that is, the 275th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage,
      whatever that might eventually amount to. And though the 275th lay was
      what they call a rather _long lay_, yet it was better than nothing; and
      if we had a lucky voyage, might pretty nearly pay for the clothing I
      would wear out on it, not to speak of my three years’ beef and board,
      for which I would not have to pay one stiver.
      
      It might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely
      fortune—and so it was, a very poor way indeed. But I am one of those
      that never take on about princely fortunes, and am quite content if the
      world is ready to board and lodge me, while I am putting up at this
      grim sign of the Thunder Cloud. Upon the whole, I thought that the
      275th lay would be about the fair thing, but would not have been
      surprised had I been offered the 200th, considering I was of a
      broad-shouldered make.
      
      But one thing, nevertheless, that made me a little distrustful about
      receiving a generous share of the profits was this: Ashore, I had heard
      something of both Captain Peleg and his unaccountable old crony Bildad;
      how that they being the principal proprietors of the Pequod, therefore
      the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners, left nearly the
      whole management of the ship’s affairs to these two. And I did not know
      but what the stingy old Bildad might have a mighty deal to say about
      shipping hands, especially as I now found him on board the Pequod,
      quite at home there in the cabin, and reading his Bible as if at his
      own fireside. Now while Peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his
      jack-knife, old Bildad, to my no small surprise, considering that he
      was such an interested party in these proceedings; Bildad never heeded
      us, but went on mumbling to himself out of his book, “_Lay_ not up for
      yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth—”
      
      “Well, Captain Bildad,” interrupted Peleg, “what d’ye say, what lay
      shall we give this young man?”
      
      “Thou knowest best,” was the sepulchral reply, “the seven hundred and
      seventy-seventh wouldn’t be too much, would it?—‘where moth and rust do
      corrupt, but _lay_—’”
      
      _Lay_, indeed, thought I, and such a lay! the seven hundred and
      seventy-seventh! Well, old Bildad, you are determined that I, for one,
      shall not _lay_ up many _lays_ here below, where moth and rust do
      corrupt. It was an exceedingly _long lay_ that, indeed; and though from
      the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman, yet
      the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and
      seventy-seven is a pretty large number, yet, when you come to make a
      _teenth_ of it, you will then see, I say, that the seven hundred and
      seventy-seventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven
      hundred and seventy-seven gold doubloons; and so I thought at the time.
      
      “Why, blast your eyes, Bildad,” cried Peleg, “thou dost not want to
      swindle this young man! he must have more than that.”
      
      “Seven hundred and seventy-seventh,” again said Bildad, without lifting
      his eyes; and then went on mumbling—“for where your treasure is, there
      will your heart be also.”
      
      “I am going to put him down for the three hundredth,” said Peleg, “do
      ye hear that, Bildad! The three hundredth lay, I say.”
      
      Bildad laid down his book, and turning solemnly towards him said,
      “Captain Peleg, thou hast a generous heart; but thou must consider the
      duty thou owest to the other owners of this ship—widows and orphans,
      many of them—and that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this
      young man, we may be taking the bread from those widows and those
      orphans. The seven hundred and seventy-seventh lay, Captain Peleg.”
      
      “Thou Bildad!” roared Peleg, starting up and clattering about the
      cabin. “Blast ye, Captain Bildad, if I had followed thy advice in these
      matters, I would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be
      heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round Cape
      Horn.”
      
      “Captain Peleg,” said Bildad steadily, “thy conscience may be drawing
      ten inches of water, or ten fathoms, I can’t tell; but as thou art
      still an impenitent man, Captain Peleg, I greatly fear lest thy
      conscience be but a leaky one; and will in the end sink thee foundering
      down to the fiery pit, Captain Peleg.”
      
      “Fiery pit! fiery pit! ye insult me, man; past all natural bearing, ye
      insult me. It’s an all-fired outrage to tell any human creature that
      he’s bound to hell. Flukes and flames! Bildad, say that again to me,
      and start my soul-bolts, but I’ll—I’ll—yes, I’ll swallow a live goat
      with all his hair and horns on. Out of the cabin, ye canting,
      drab-coloured son of a wooden gun—a straight wake with ye!”
      
      As he thundered out this he made a rush at Bildad, but with a
      marvellous oblique, sliding celerity, Bildad for that time eluded him.
      
      Alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and
      responsible owners of the ship, and feeling half a mind to give up all
      idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily
      commanded, I stepped aside from the door to give egress to Bildad, who,
      I made no doubt, was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened
      wrath of Peleg. But to my astonishment, he sat down again on the
      transom very quietly, and seemed to have not the slightest intention of
      withdrawing. He seemed quite used to impenitent Peleg and his ways. As
      for Peleg, after letting off his rage as he had, there seemed no more
      left in him, and he, too, sat down like a lamb, though he twitched a
      little as if still nervously agitated. “Whew!” he whistled at last—“the
      squall’s gone off to leeward, I think. Bildad, thou used to be good at
      sharpening a lance, mend that pen, will ye. My jack-knife here needs
      the grindstone. That’s he; thank ye, Bildad. Now then, my young man,
      Ishmael’s thy name, didn’t ye say? Well then, down ye go here, Ishmael,
      for the three hundredth lay.”
      
      “Captain Peleg,” said I, “I have a friend with me who wants to ship
      too—shall I bring him down to-morrow?”
      
      “To be sure,” said Peleg. “Fetch him along, and we’ll look at him.”
      
      “What lay does he want?” groaned Bildad, glancing up from the book in
      which he had again been burying himself.
      
      “Oh! never thee mind about that, Bildad,” said Peleg. “Has he ever
      whaled it any?” turning to me.
      
      “Killed more whales than I can count, Captain Peleg.”
      
      “Well, bring him along then.”
      
      And, after signing the papers, off I went; nothing doubting but that I
      had done a good morning’s work, and that the Pequod was the identical
      ship that Yojo had provided to carry Queequeg and me round the Cape.
      
      But I had not proceeded far, when I began to bethink me that the
      Captain with whom I was to sail yet remained unseen by me; though,
      indeed, in many cases, a whale-ship will be completely fitted out, and
      receive all her crew on board, ere the captain makes himself visible by
      arriving to take command; for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged,
      and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief, that if the
      captain have a family, or any absorbing concernment of that sort, he
      does not trouble himself much about his ship in port, but leaves her to
      the owners till all is ready for sea. However, it is always as well to
      have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his
      hands. Turning back I accosted Captain Peleg, inquiring where Captain
      Ahab was to be found.
      
      “And what dost thou want of Captain Ahab? It’s all right enough; thou
      art shipped.”
      
      “Yes, but I should like to see him.”
      
      “But I don’t think thou wilt be able to at present. I don’t know
      exactly what’s the matter with him; but he keeps close inside the
      house; a sort of sick, and yet he don’t look so. In fact, he ain’t
      sick; but no, he isn’t well either. Any how, young man, he won’t always
      see me, so I don’t suppose he will thee. He’s a queer man, Captain
      Ahab—so some think—but a good one. Oh, thou’lt like him well enough; no
      fear, no fear. He’s a grand, ungodly, god-like man, Captain Ahab;
      doesn’t speak much; but, when he does speak, then you may well listen.
      Mark ye, be forewarned; Ahab’s above the common; Ahab’s been in
      colleges, as well as ’mong the cannibals; been used to deeper wonders
      than the waves; fixed his fiery lance in mightier, stranger foes than
      whales. His lance! aye, the keenest and the surest that out of all our
      isle! Oh! he ain’t Captain Bildad; no, and he ain’t Captain Peleg;
      _he’s Ahab_, boy; and Ahab of old, thou knowest, was a crowned king!”
      
      “And a very vile one. When that wicked king was slain, the dogs, did
      they not lick his blood?”
      
      “Come hither to me—hither, hither,” said Peleg, with a significance in
      his eye that almost startled me. “Look ye, lad; never say that on board
      the Pequod. Never say it anywhere. Captain Ahab did not name himself.
      ’Twas a foolish, ignorant whim of his crazy, widowed mother, who died
      when he was only a twelvemonth old. And yet the old squaw Tistig, at
      Gayhead, said that the name would somehow prove prophetic. And,
      perhaps, other fools like her may tell thee the same. I wish to warn
      thee. It’s a lie. I know Captain Ahab well; I’ve sailed with him as
      mate years ago; I know what he is—a good man—not a pious, good man,
      like Bildad, but a swearing good man—something like me—only there’s a
      good deal more of him. Aye, aye, I know that he was never very jolly;
      and I know that on the passage home, he was a little out of his mind
      for a spell; but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump
      that brought that about, as any one might see. I know, too, that ever
      since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale, he’s been a
      kind of moody—desperate moody, and savage sometimes; but that will all
      pass off. And once for all, let me tell thee and assure thee, young
      man, it’s better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad
      one. So good-bye to thee—and wrong not Captain Ahab, because he happens
      to have a wicked name. Besides, my boy, he has a wife—not three voyages
      wedded—a sweet, resigned girl. Think of that; by that sweet girl that
      old man has a child: hold ye then there can be any utter, hopeless harm
      in Ahab? No, no, my lad; stricken, blasted, if he be, Ahab has his
      humanities!”
      
      As I walked away, I was full of thoughtfulness; what had been
      incidentally revealed to me of Captain Ahab, filled me with a certain
      wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him. And somehow, at the time,
      I felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him, but for I don’t know what,
      unless it was the cruel loss of his leg. And yet I also felt a strange
      awe of him; but that sort of awe, which I cannot at all describe, was
      not exactly awe; I do not know what it was. But I felt it; and it did
      not disincline me towards him; though I felt impatience at what seemed
      like mystery in him, so imperfectly as he was known to me then.
      However, my thoughts were at length carried in other directions, so
      that for the present dark Ahab slipped my mind.
      
      
      CHAPTER 17. The Ramadan.
      
      As Queequeg’s Ramadan, or Fasting and Humiliation, was to continue all
      day, I did not choose to disturb him till towards night-fall; for I
      cherish the greatest respect towards everybody’s religious obligations,
      never mind how comical, and could not find it in my heart to undervalue
      even a congregation of ants worshipping a toad-stool; or those other
      creatures in certain parts of our earth, who with a degree of
      footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets, bow down before the
      torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the
      inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name.
      
      I say, we good Presbyterian Christians should be charitable in these
      things, and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals,
      pagans and what not, because of their half-crazy conceits on these
      subjects. There was Queequeg, now, certainly entertaining the most
      absurd notions about Yojo and his Ramadan;—but what of that? Queequeg
      thought he knew what he was about, I suppose; he seemed to be content;
      and there let him rest. All our arguing with him would not avail; let
      him be, I say: and Heaven have mercy on us all—Presbyterians and Pagans
      alike—for we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head, and
      sadly need mending.
      
      Towards evening, when I felt assured that all his performances and
      rituals must be over, I went up to his room and knocked at the door;
      but no answer. I tried to open it, but it was fastened inside.
      “Queequeg,” said I softly through the key-hole:—all silent. “I say,
      Queequeg! why don’t you speak? It’s I—Ishmael.” But all remained still
      as before. I began to grow alarmed. I had allowed him such abundant
      time; I thought he might have had an apoplectic fit. I looked through
      the key-hole; but the door opening into an odd corner of the room, the
      key-hole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one. I could only see
      part of the foot-board of the bed and a line of the wall, but nothing
      more. I was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden
      shaft of Queequeg’s harpoon, which the landlady the evening previous
      had taken from him, before our mounting to the chamber. That’s strange,
      thought I; but at any rate, since the harpoon stands yonder, and he
      seldom or never goes abroad without it, therefore he must be inside
      here, and no possible mistake.
      
      “Queequeg!—Queequeg!”—all still. Something must have happened.
      Apoplexy! I tried to burst open the door; but it stubbornly resisted.
      Running down stairs, I quickly stated my suspicions to the first person
      I met—the chamber-maid. “La! la!” she cried, “I thought something must
      be the matter. I went to make the bed after breakfast, and the door was
      locked; and not a mouse to be heard; and it’s been just so silent ever
      since. But I thought, may be, you had both gone off and locked your
      baggage in for safe keeping. La! la, ma’am!—Mistress! murder! Mrs.
      Hussey! apoplexy!”—and with these cries, she ran towards the kitchen, I
      following.
      
      Mrs. Hussey soon appeared, with a mustard-pot in one hand and a
      vinegar-cruet in the other, having just broken away from the occupation
      of attending to the castors, and scolding her little black boy
      meantime.
      
      “Wood-house!” cried I, “which way to it? Run for God’s sake, and fetch
      something to pry open the door—the axe!—the axe! he’s had a stroke;
      depend upon it!”—and so saying I was unmethodically rushing up stairs
      again empty-handed, when Mrs. Hussey interposed the mustard-pot and
      vinegar-cruet, and the entire castor of her countenance.
      
      “What’s the matter with you, young man?”
      
      “Get the axe! For God’s sake, run for the doctor, some one, while I pry
      it open!”
      
      “Look here,” said the landlady, quickly putting down the vinegar-cruet,
      so as to have one hand free; “look here; are you talking about prying
      open any of my doors?”—and with that she seized my arm. “What’s the
      matter with you? What’s the matter with you, shipmate?”
      
      In as calm, but rapid a manner as possible, I gave her to understand
      the whole case. Unconsciously clapping the vinegar-cruet to one side of
      her nose, she ruminated for an instant; then exclaimed—“No! I haven’t
      seen it since I put it there.” Running to a little closet under the
      landing of the stairs, she glanced in, and returning, told me that
      Queequeg’s harpoon was missing. “He’s killed himself,” she cried. “It’s
      unfort’nate Stiggs done over again—there goes another counterpane—God
      pity his poor mother!—it will be the ruin of my house. Has the poor lad
      a sister? Where’s that girl?—there, Betty, go to Snarles the Painter,
      and tell him to paint me a sign, with—“no suicides permitted here, and
      no smoking in the parlor;”—might as well kill both birds at once. Kill?
      The Lord be merciful to his ghost! What’s that noise there? You, young
      man, avast there!”
      
      And running up after me, she caught me as I was again trying to force
      open the door.
      
      “I don’t allow it; I won’t have my premises spoiled. Go for the
      locksmith, there’s one about a mile from here. But avast!” putting her
      hand in her side-pocket, “here’s a key that’ll fit, I guess; let’s
      see.” And with that, she turned it in the lock; but, alas! Queequeg’s
      supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within.
      
      “Have to burst it open,” said I, and was running down the entry a
      little, for a good start, when the landlady caught at me, again vowing
      I should not break down her premises; but I tore from her, and with a
      sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark.
      
      With a prodigious noise the door flew open, and the knob slamming
      against the wall, sent the plaster to the ceiling; and there, good
      heavens! there sat Queequeg, altogether cool and self-collected; right
      in the middle of the room; squatting on his hams, and holding Yojo on
      top of his head. He looked neither one way nor the other way, but sat
      like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life.
      
      “Queequeg,” said I, going up to him, “Queequeg, what’s the matter with
      you?”
      
      “He hain’t been a sittin’ so all day, has he?” said the landlady.
      
      But all we said, not a word could we drag out of him; I almost felt
      like pushing him over, so as to change his position, for it was almost
      intolerable, it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained;
      especially, as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of
      eight or ten hours, going too without his regular meals.
      
      “Mrs. Hussey,” said I, “he’s _alive_ at all events; so leave us, if you
      please, and I will see to this strange affair myself.”
      
      Closing the door upon the landlady, I endeavored to prevail upon
      Queequeg to take a chair; but in vain. There he sat; and all he could
      do—for all my polite arts and blandishments—he would not move a peg,
      nor say a single word, nor even look at me, nor notice my presence in
      the slightest way.
      
      I wonder, thought I, if this can possibly be a part of his Ramadan; do
      they fast on their hams that way in his native island. It must be so;
      yes, it’s part of his creed, I suppose; well, then, let him rest; he’ll
      get up sooner or later, no doubt. It can’t last for ever, thank God,
      and his Ramadan only comes once a year; and I don’t believe it’s very
      punctual then.
      
      I went down to supper. After sitting a long time listening to the long
      stories of some sailors who had just come from a plum-pudding voyage,
      as they called it (that is, a short whaling-voyage in a schooner or
      brig, confined to the north of the line, in the Atlantic Ocean only);
      after listening to these plum-puddingers till nearly eleven o’clock, I
      went up stairs to go to bed, feeling quite sure by this time Queequeg
      must certainly have brought his Ramadan to a termination. But no; there
      he was just where I had left him; he had not stirred an inch. I began
      to grow vexed with him; it seemed so downright senseless and insane to
      be sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room,
      holding a piece of wood on his head.
      
      “For heaven’s sake, Queequeg, get up and shake yourself; get up and
      have some supper. You’ll starve; you’ll kill yourself, Queequeg.” But
      not a word did he reply.
      
      Despairing of him, therefore, I determined to go to bed and to sleep;
      and no doubt, before a great while, he would follow me. But previous to
      turning in, I took my heavy bearskin jacket, and threw it over him, as
      it promised to be a very cold night; and he had nothing but his
      ordinary round jacket on. For some time, do all I would, I could not
      get into the faintest doze. I had blown out the candle; and the mere
      thought of Queequeg—not four feet off—sitting there in that uneasy
      position, stark alone in the cold and dark; this made me really
      wretched. Think of it; sleeping all night in the same room with a wide
      awake pagan on his hams in this dreary, unaccountable Ramadan!
      
      But somehow I dropped off at last, and knew nothing more till break of
      day; when, looking over the bedside, there squatted Queequeg, as if he
      had been screwed down to the floor. But as soon as the first glimpse of
      sun entered the window, up he got, with stiff and grating joints, but
      with a cheerful look; limped towards me where I lay; pressed his
      forehead again against mine; and said his Ramadan was over.
      
      Now, as I before hinted, I have no objection to any person’s religion,
      be it what it may, so long as that person does not kill or insult any
      other person, because that other person don’t believe it also. But when
      a man’s religion becomes really frantic; when it is a positive torment
      to him; and, in fine, makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to
      lodge in; then I think it high time to take that individual aside and
      argue the point with him.
      
      And just so I now did with Queequeg. “Queequeg,” said I, “get into bed
      now, and lie and listen to me.” I then went on, beginning with the rise
      and progress of the primitive religions, and coming down to the various
      religions of the present time, during which time I labored to show
      Queequeg that all these Lents, Ramadans, and prolonged ham-squattings
      in cold, cheerless rooms were stark nonsense; bad for the health;
      useless for the soul; opposed, in short, to the obvious laws of Hygiene
      and common sense. I told him, too, that he being in other things such
      an extremely sensible and sagacious savage, it pained me, very badly
      pained me, to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous
      Ramadan of his. Besides, argued I, fasting makes the body cave in;
      hence the spirit caves in; and all thoughts born of a fast must
      necessarily be half-starved. This is the reason why most dyspeptic
      religionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters. In
      one word, Queequeg, said I, rather digressively; hell is an idea first
      born on an undigested apple-dumpling; and since then perpetuated
      through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by Ramadans.
      
      I then asked Queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with
      dyspepsia; expressing the idea very plainly, so that he could take it
      in. He said no; only upon one memorable occasion. It was after a great
      feast given by his father the king, on the gaining of a great battle
      wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two o’clock in the
      afternoon, and all cooked and eaten that very evening.
      
      “No more, Queequeg,” said I, shuddering; “that will do;” for I knew the
      inferences without his further hinting them. I had seen a sailor who
      had visited that very island, and he told me that it was the custom,
      when a great battle had been gained there, to barbecue all the slain in
      the yard or garden of the victor; and then, one by one, they were
      placed in great wooden trenchers, and garnished round like a pilau,
      with breadfruit and cocoanuts; and with some parsley in their mouths,
      were sent round with the victor’s compliments to all his friends, just
      as though these presents were so many Christmas turkeys.
      
      After all, I do not think that my remarks about religion made much
      impression upon Queequeg. Because, in the first place, he somehow
      seemed dull of hearing on that important subject, unless considered
      from his own point of view; and, in the second place, he did not more
      than one third understand me, couch my ideas simply as I would; and,
      finally, he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true
      religion than I did. He looked at me with a sort of condescending
      concern and compassion, as though he thought it a great pity that such
      a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan
      piety.
      
      At last we rose and dressed; and Queequeg, taking a prodigiously hearty
      breakfast of chowders of all sorts, so that the landlady should not
      make much profit by reason of his Ramadan, we sallied out to board the
      Pequod, sauntering along, and picking our teeth with halibut bones.
      
      
      CHAPTER 18. His Mark.
      
      As we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship, Queequeg
      carrying his harpoon, Captain Peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us
      from his wigwam, saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal,
      and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that
      craft, unless they previously produced their papers.
      
      “What do you mean by that, Captain Peleg?” said I, now jumping on the
      bulwarks, and leaving my comrade standing on the wharf.
      
      “I mean,” he replied, “he must show his papers.”
      
      “Yes,” said Captain Bildad in his hollow voice, sticking his head from
      behind Peleg’s, out of the wigwam. “He must show that he’s converted.
      Son of darkness,” he added, turning to Queequeg, “art thou at present
      in communion with any Christian church?”
      
      “Why,” said I, “he’s a member of the first Congregational Church.” Here
      be it said, that many tattooed savages sailing in Nantucket ships at
      last come to be converted into the churches.
      
      “First Congregational Church,” cried Bildad, “what! that worships in
      Deacon Deuteronomy Coleman’s meeting-house?” and so saying, taking out
      his spectacles, he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana
      handkerchief, and putting them on very carefully, came out of the
      wigwam, and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks, took a good long look at
      Queequeg.
      
      “How long hath he been a member?” he then said, turning to me; “not
      very long, I rather guess, young man.”
      
      “No,” said Peleg, “and he hasn’t been baptized right either, or it
      would have washed some of that devil’s blue off his face.”
      
      “Do tell, now,” cried Bildad, “is this Philistine a regular member of
      Deacon Deuteronomy’s meeting? I never saw him going there, and I pass
      it every Lord’s day.”
      
      “I don’t know anything about Deacon Deuteronomy or his meeting,” said
      I; “all I know is, that Queequeg here is a born member of the First
      Congregational Church. He is a deacon himself, Queequeg is.”
      
      “Young man,” said Bildad sternly, “thou art skylarking with me—explain
      thyself, thou young Hittite. What church dost thee mean? answer me.”
      
      Finding myself thus hard pushed, I replied. “I mean, sir, the same
      ancient Catholic Church to which you and I, and Captain Peleg there,
      and Queequeg here, and all of us, and every mother’s son and soul of us
      belong; the great and everlasting First Congregation of this whole
      worshipping world; we all belong to that; only some of us cherish some
      queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief; in _that_ we all
      join hands.”
      
      “Splice, thou mean’st _splice_ hands,” cried Peleg, drawing nearer.
      “Young man, you’d better ship for a missionary, instead of a fore-mast
      hand; I never heard a better sermon. Deacon Deuteronomy—why Father
      Mapple himself couldn’t beat it, and he’s reckoned something. Come
      aboard, come aboard; never mind about the papers. I say, tell Quohog
      there—what’s that you call him? tell Quohog to step along. By the great
      anchor, what a harpoon he’s got there! looks like good stuff that; and
      he handles it about right. I say, Quohog, or whatever your name is, did
      you ever stand in the head of a whale-boat? did you ever strike a
      fish?”
      
      Without saying a word, Queequeg, in his wild sort of way, jumped upon
      the bulwarks, from thence into the bows of one of the whale-boats
      hanging to the side; and then bracing his left knee, and poising his
      harpoon, cried out in some such way as this:—
      
      “Cap’ain, you see him small drop tar on water dere? You see him? well,
      spose him one whale eye, well, den!” and taking sharp aim at it, he
      darted the iron right over old Bildad’s broad brim, clean across the
      ship’s decks, and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight.
      
      “Now,” said Queequeg, quietly hauling in the line, “spos-ee him whale-e
      eye; why, dad whale dead.”
      
      “Quick, Bildad,” said Peleg, his partner, who, aghast at the close
      vicinity of the flying harpoon, had retreated towards the cabin
      gangway. “Quick, I say, you Bildad, and get the ship’s papers. We must
      have Hedgehog there, I mean Quohog, in one of our boats. Look ye,
      Quohog, we’ll give ye the ninetieth lay, and that’s more than ever was
      given a harpooneer yet out of Nantucket.”
      
      So down we went into the cabin, and to my great joy Queequeg was soon
      enrolled among the same ship’s company to which I myself belonged.
      
      When all preliminaries were over and Peleg had got everything ready for
      signing, he turned to me and said, “I guess, Quohog there don’t know
      how to write, does he? I say, Quohog, blast ye! dost thou sign thy name
      or make thy mark?”
      
      But at this question, Queequeg, who had twice or thrice before taken
      part in similar ceremonies, looked no ways abashed; but taking the
      offered pen, copied upon the paper, in the proper place, an exact
      counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm; so
      that through Captain Peleg’s obstinate mistake touching his
      appellative, it stood something like this:—
      
      Quohog. his X mark.
      
      Meanwhile Captain Bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing Queequeg,
      and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his
      broad-skirted drab coat, took out a bundle of tracts, and selecting one
      entitled “The Latter Day Coming; or No Time to Lose,” placed it in
      Queequeg’s hands, and then grasping them and the book with both his,
      looked earnestly into his eyes, and said, “Son of darkness, I must do
      my duty by thee; I am part owner of this ship, and feel concerned for
      the souls of all its crew; if thou still clingest to thy Pagan ways,
      which I sadly fear, I beseech thee, remain not for aye a Belial
      bondsman. Spurn the idol Bell, and the hideous dragon; turn from the
      wrath to come; mind thine eye, I say; oh! goodness gracious! steer
      clear of the fiery pit!”
      
      Something of the salt sea yet lingered in old Bildad’s language,
      heterogeneously mixed with Scriptural and domestic phrases.
      
      “Avast there, avast there, Bildad, avast now spoiling our harpooneer,”
      cried Peleg. “Pious harpooneers never make good voyagers—it takes the
      shark out of ’em; no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty
      sharkish. There was young Nat Swaine, once the bravest boat-header out
      of all Nantucket and the Vineyard; he joined the meeting, and never
      came to good. He got so frightened about his plaguy soul, that he
      shrinked and sheered away from whales, for fear of after-claps, in case
      he got stove and went to Davy Jones.”
      
      “Peleg! Peleg!” said Bildad, lifting his eyes and hands, “thou thyself,
      as I myself, hast seen many a perilous time; thou knowest, Peleg, what
      it is to have the fear of death; how, then, can’st thou prate in this
      ungodly guise. Thou beliest thine own heart, Peleg. Tell me, when this
      same Pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on
      Japan, that same voyage when thou went mate with Captain Ahab, did’st
      thou not think of Death and the Judgment then?”
      
      “Hear him, hear him now,” cried Peleg, marching across the cabin, and
      thrusting his hands far down into his pockets,—“hear him, all of ye.
      Think of that! When every moment we thought the ship would sink! Death
      and the Judgment then? What? With all three masts making such an
      everlasting thundering against the side; and every sea breaking over
      us, fore and aft. Think of Death and the Judgment then? No! no time to
      think about Death then. Life was what Captain Ahab and I was thinking
      of; and how to save all hands—how to rig jury-masts—how to get into the
      nearest port; that was what I was thinking of.”
      
      Bildad said no more, but buttoning up his coat, stalked on deck, where
      we followed him. There he stood, very quietly overlooking some
      sailmakers who were mending a top-sail in the waist. Now and then he
      stooped to pick up a patch, or save an end of tarred twine, which
      otherwise might have been wasted.
      
      
      CHAPTER 19. The Prophet.
      
      “Shipmates, have ye shipped in that ship?”
      
      Queequeg and I had just left the Pequod, and were sauntering away from
      the water, for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts, when the
      above words were put to us by a stranger, who, pausing before us,
      levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question. He was but
      shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers; a rag of a
      black handkerchief investing his neck. A confluent small-pox had in all
      directions flowed over his face, and left it like the complicated
      ribbed bed of a torrent, when the rushing waters have been dried up.
      
      “Have ye shipped in her?” he repeated.
      
      “You mean the ship Pequod, I suppose,” said I, trying to gain a little
      more time for an uninterrupted look at him.
      
      “Aye, the Pequod—that ship there,” he said, drawing back his whole arm,
      and then rapidly shoving it straight out from him, with the fixed
      bayonet of his pointed finger darted full at the object.
      
      “Yes,” said I, “we have just signed the articles.”
      
      “Anything down there about your souls?”
      
      “About what?”
      
      “Oh, perhaps you hav’n’t got any,” he said quickly. “No matter though,
      I know many chaps that hav’n’t got any,—good luck to ’em; and they are
      all the better off for it. A soul’s a sort of a fifth wheel to a
      wagon.”
      
      “What are you jabbering about, shipmate?” said I.
      
      “_He’s_ got enough, though, to make up for all deficiencies of that
      sort in other chaps,” abruptly said the stranger, placing a nervous
      emphasis upon the word _he_.
      
      “Queequeg,” said I, “let’s go; this fellow has broken loose from
      somewhere; he’s talking about something and somebody we don’t know.”
      
      “Stop!” cried the stranger. “Ye said true—ye hav’n’t seen Old Thunder
      yet, have ye?”
      
      “Who’s Old Thunder?” said I, again riveted with the insane earnestness
      of his manner.
      
      “Captain Ahab.”
      
      “What! the captain of our ship, the Pequod?”
      
      “Aye, among some of us old sailor chaps, he goes by that name. Ye
      hav’n’t seen him yet, have ye?”
      
      “No, we hav’n’t. He’s sick they say, but is getting better, and will be
      all right again before long.”
      
      “All right again before long!” laughed the stranger, with a solemnly
      derisive sort of laugh. “Look ye; when Captain Ahab is all right, then
      this left arm of mine will be all right; not before.”
      
      “What do you know about him?”
      
      “What did they _tell_ you about him? Say that!”
      
      “They didn’t tell much of anything about him; only I’ve heard that he’s
      a good whale-hunter, and a good captain to his crew.”
      
      “That’s true, that’s true—yes, both true enough. But you must jump when
      he gives an order. Step and growl; growl and go—that’s the word with
      Captain Ahab. But nothing about that thing that happened to him off
      Cape Horn, long ago, when he lay like dead for three days and nights;
      nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the Spaniard afore the altar
      in Santa?—heard nothing about that, eh? Nothing about the silver
      calabash he spat into? And nothing about his losing his leg last
      voyage, according to the prophecy. Didn’t ye hear a word about them
      matters and something more, eh? No, I don’t think ye did; how could ye?
      Who knows it? Not all Nantucket, I guess. But hows’ever, mayhap, ye’ve
      heard tell about the leg, and how he lost it; aye, ye have heard of
      that, I dare say. Oh yes, _that_ every one knows a’most—I mean they
      know he’s only one leg; and that a parmacetti took the other off.”
      
      “My friend,” said I, “what all this gibberish of yours is about, I
      don’t know, and I don’t much care; for it seems to me that you must be
      a little damaged in the head. But if you are speaking of Captain Ahab,
      of that ship there, the Pequod, then let me tell you, that I know all
      about the loss of his leg.”
      
      “_All_ about it, eh—sure you do?—all?”
      
      “Pretty sure.”
      
      With finger pointed and eye levelled at the Pequod, the beggar-like
      stranger stood a moment, as if in a troubled reverie; then starting a
      little, turned and said:—“Ye’ve shipped, have ye? Names down on the
      papers? Well, well, what’s signed, is signed; and what’s to be, will
      be; and then again, perhaps it won’t be, after all. Anyhow, it’s all
      fixed and arranged a’ready; and some sailors or other must go with him,
      I suppose; as well these as any other men, God pity ’em! Morning to ye,
      shipmates, morning; the ineffable heavens bless ye; I’m sorry I stopped
      ye.”
      
      “Look here, friend,” said I, “if you have anything important to tell
      us, out with it; but if you are only trying to bamboozle us, you are
      mistaken in your game; that’s all I have to say.”
      
      “And it’s said very well, and I like to hear a chap talk up that way;
      you are just the man for him—the likes of ye. Morning to ye, shipmates,
      morning! Oh! when ye get there, tell ’em I’ve concluded not to make one
      of ’em.”
      
      “Ah, my dear fellow, you can’t fool us that way—you can’t fool us. It
      is the easiest thing in the world for a man to look as if he had a
      great secret in him.”
      
      “Morning to ye, shipmates, morning.”
      
      “Morning it is,” said I. “Come along, Queequeg, let’s leave this crazy
      man. But stop, tell me your name, will you?”
      
      “Elijah.”
      
      Elijah! thought I, and we walked away, both commenting, after each
      other’s fashion, upon this ragged old sailor; and agreed that he was
      nothing but a humbug, trying to be a bugbear. But we had not gone
      perhaps above a hundred yards, when chancing to turn a corner, and
      looking back as I did so, who should be seen but Elijah following us,
      though at a distance. Somehow, the sight of him struck me so, that I
      said nothing to Queequeg of his being behind, but passed on with my
      comrade, anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner
      that we did. He did; and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us,
      but with what intent I could not for the life of me imagine. This
      circumstance, coupled with his ambiguous, half-hinting, half-revealing,
      shrouded sort of talk, now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments
      and half-apprehensions, and all connected with the Pequod; and Captain
      Ahab; and the leg he had lost; and the Cape Horn fit; and the silver
      calabash; and what Captain Peleg had said of him, when I left the ship
      the day previous; and the prediction of the squaw Tistig; and the
      voyage we had bound ourselves to sail; and a hundred other shadowy
      things.
      
      I was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged Elijah was really
      dogging us or not, and with that intent crossed the way with Queequeg,
      and on that side of it retraced our steps. But Elijah passed on,
      without seeming to notice us. This relieved me; and once more, and
      finally as it seemed to me, I pronounced him in my heart, a humbug.
      
      
      CHAPTER 20. All Astir.
      
      A day or two passed, and there was great activity aboard the Pequod.
      Not only were the old sails being mended, but new sails were coming on
      board, and bolts of canvas, and coils of rigging; in short, everything
      betokened that the ship’s preparations were hurrying to a close.
      Captain Peleg seldom or never went ashore, but sat in his wigwam
      keeping a sharp look-out upon the hands: Bildad did all the purchasing
      and providing at the stores; and the men employed in the hold and on
      the rigging were working till long after night-fall.
      
      On the day following Queequeg’s signing the articles, word was given at
      all the inns where the ship’s company were stopping, that their chests
      must be on board before night, for there was no telling how soon the
      vessel might be sailing. So Queequeg and I got down our traps,
      resolving, however, to sleep ashore till the last. But it seems they
      always give very long notice in these cases, and the ship did not sail
      for several days. But no wonder; there was a good deal to be done, and
      there is no telling how many things to be thought of, before the Pequod
      was fully equipped.
      
      Every one knows what a multitude of things—beds, sauce-pans, knives and
      forks, shovels and tongs, napkins, nut-crackers, and what not, are
      indispensable to the business of housekeeping. Just so with whaling,
      which necessitates a three-years’ housekeeping upon the wide ocean, far
      from all grocers, costermongers, doctors, bakers, and bankers. And
      though this also holds true of merchant vessels, yet not by any means
      to the same extent as with whalemen. For besides the great length of
      the whaling voyage, the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution
      of the fishery, and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote
      harbors usually frequented, it must be remembered, that of all ships,
      whaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds, and
      especially to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which
      the success of the voyage most depends. Hence, the spare boats, spare
      spars, and spare lines and harpoons, and spare everythings, almost, but
      a spare Captain and duplicate ship.
      
      At the period of our arrival at the Island, the heaviest storage of the
      Pequod had been almost completed; comprising her beef, bread, water,
      fuel, and iron hoops and staves. But, as before hinted, for some time
      there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and
      ends of things, both large and small.
      
      Chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was Captain
      Bildad’s sister, a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable
      spirit, but withal very kindhearted, who seemed resolved that, if _she_
      could help it, nothing should be found wanting in the Pequod, after
      once fairly getting to sea. At one time she would come on board with a
      jar of pickles for the steward’s pantry; another time with a bunch of
      quills for the chief mate’s desk, where he kept his log; a third time
      with a roll of flannel for the small of some one’s rheumatic back.
      Never did any woman better deserve her name, which was Charity—Aunt
      Charity, as everybody called her. And like a sister of charity did this
      charitable Aunt Charity bustle about hither and thither, ready to turn
      her hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety, comfort,
      and consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother
      Bildad was concerned, and in which she herself owned a score or two of
      well-saved dollars.
      
      But it was startling to see this excellent hearted Quakeress coming on
      board, as she did the last day, with a long oil-ladle in one hand, and
      a still longer whaling lance in the other. Nor was Bildad himself nor
      Captain Peleg at all backward. As for Bildad, he carried about with him
      a long list of the articles needed, and at every fresh arrival, down
      went his mark opposite that article upon the paper. Every once in a
      while Peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den, roaring at the men
      down the hatchways, roaring up to the riggers at the mast-head, and
      then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam.
      
      During these days of preparation, Queequeg and I often visited the
      craft, and as often I asked about Captain Ahab, and how he was, and
      when he was going to come on board his ship. To these questions they
      would answer, that he was getting better and better, and was expected
      aboard every day; meantime, the two captains, Peleg and Bildad, could
      attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage. If I
      had been downright honest with myself, I would have seen very plainly
      in my heart that I did but half fancy being committed this way to so
      long a voyage, without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the
      absolute dictator of it, so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open
      sea. But when a man suspects any wrong, it sometimes happens that if he
      be already involved in the matter, he insensibly strives to cover up
      his suspicions even from himself. And much this way it was with me. I
      said nothing, and tried to think nothing.
      
      At last it was given out that some time next day the ship would
      certainly sail. So next morning, Queequeg and I took a very early
      start.
      
      
      CHAPTER 21. Going Aboard.
      
      It was nearly six o’clock, but only grey imperfect misty dawn, when we
      drew nigh the wharf.
      
      “There are some sailors running ahead there, if I see right,” said I to
      Queequeg, “it can’t be shadows; she’s off by sunrise, I guess; come
      on!”
      
      “Avast!” cried a voice, whose owner at the same time coming close
      behind us, laid a hand upon both our shoulders, and then insinuating
      himself between us, stood stooping forward a little, in the uncertain
      twilight, strangely peering from Queequeg to me. It was Elijah.
      
      “Going aboard?”
      
      “Hands off, will you,” said I.
      
      “Lookee here,” said Queequeg, shaking himself, “go ’way!”
      
      “Ain’t going aboard, then?”
      
      “Yes, we are,” said I, “but what business is that of yours? Do you
      know, Mr. Elijah, that I consider you a little impertinent?”
      
      “No, no, no; I wasn’t aware of that,” said Elijah, slowly and
      wonderingly looking from me to Queequeg, with the most unaccountable
      glances.
      
      “Elijah,” said I, “you will oblige my friend and me by withdrawing. We
      are going to the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and would prefer not to be
      detained.”
      
      “Ye be, be ye? Coming back afore breakfast?”
      
      “He’s cracked, Queequeg,” said I, “come on.”
      
      “Holloa!” cried stationary Elijah, hailing us when we had removed a few
      paces.
      
      “Never mind him,” said I, “Queequeg, come on.”
      
      But he stole up to us again, and suddenly clapping his hand on my
      shoulder, said—“Did ye see anything looking like men going towards that
      ship a while ago?”
      
      Struck by this plain matter-of-fact question, I answered, saying, “Yes,
      I thought I did see four or five men; but it was too dim to be sure.”
      
      “Very dim, very dim,” said Elijah. “Morning to ye.”
      
      Once more we quitted him; but once more he came softly after us; and
      touching my shoulder again, said, “See if you can find ’em now, will
      ye?
      
      “Find who?”
      
      “Morning to ye! morning to ye!” he rejoined, again moving off. “Oh! I
      was going to warn ye against—but never mind, never mind—it’s all one,
      all in the family too;—sharp frost this morning, ain’t it? Good-bye to
      ye. Shan’t see ye again very soon, I guess; unless it’s before the
      Grand Jury.” And with these cracked words he finally departed, leaving
      me, for the moment, in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence.
      
      At last, stepping on board the Pequod, we found everything in profound
      quiet, not a soul moving. The cabin entrance was locked within; the
      hatches were all on, and lumbered with coils of rigging. Going forward
      to the forecastle, we found the slide of the scuttle open. Seeing a
      light, we went down, and found only an old rigger there, wrapped in a
      tattered pea-jacket. He was thrown at whole length upon two chests, his
      face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms. The profoundest slumber
      slept upon him.
      
      “Those sailors we saw, Queequeg, where can they have gone to?” said I,
      looking dubiously at the sleeper. But it seemed that, when on the
      wharf, Queequeg had not at all noticed what I now alluded to; hence I
      would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that
      matter, were it not for Elijah’s otherwise inexplicable question. But I
      beat the thing down; and again marking the sleeper, jocularly hinted to
      Queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body; telling him to
      establish himself accordingly. He put his hand upon the sleeper’s rear,
      as though feeling if it was soft enough; and then, without more ado,
      sat quietly down there.
      
      “Gracious! Queequeg, don’t sit there,” said I.
      
      “Oh! perry dood seat,” said Queequeg, “my country way; won’t hurt him
      face.”
      
      “Face!” said I, “call that his face? very benevolent countenance then;
      but how hard he breathes, he’s heaving himself; get off, Queequeg, you
      are heavy, it’s grinding the face of the poor. Get off, Queequeg! Look,
      he’ll twitch you off soon. I wonder he don’t wake.”
      
      Queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper, and
      lighted his tomahawk pipe. I sat at the feet. We kept the pipe passing
      over the sleeper, from one to the other. Meanwhile, upon questioning
      him in his broken fashion, Queequeg gave me to understand that, in his
      land, owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts, the king,
      chiefs, and great people generally, were in the custom of fattening
      some of the lower orders for ottomans; and to furnish a house
      comfortably in that respect, you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy
      fellows, and lay them round in the piers and alcoves. Besides, it was
      very convenient on an excursion; much better than those garden-chairs
      which are convertible into walking-sticks; upon occasion, a chief
      calling his attendant, and desiring him to make a settee of himself
      under a spreading tree, perhaps in some damp marshy place.
      
      While narrating these things, every time Queequeg received the tomahawk
      from me, he flourished the hatchet-side of it over the sleeper’s head.
      
      “What’s that for, Queequeg?”
      
      “Perry easy, kill-e; oh! perry easy!”
      
      He was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawk-pipe,
      which, it seemed, had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed
      his soul, when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger. The
      strong vapor now completely filling the contracted hole, it began to
      tell upon him. He breathed with a sort of muffledness; then seemed
      troubled in the nose; then revolved over once or twice; then sat up and
      rubbed his eyes.
      
      “Holloa!” he breathed at last, “who be ye smokers?”
      
      “Shipped men,” answered I, “when does she sail?”
      
      “Aye, aye, ye are going in her, be ye? She sails to-day. The Captain
      came aboard last night.”
      
      “What Captain?—Ahab?”
      
      “Who but him indeed?”
      
      I was going to ask him some further questions concerning Ahab, when we
      heard a noise on deck.
      
      “Holloa! Starbuck’s astir,” said the rigger. “He’s a lively chief mate,
      that; good man, and a pious; but all alive now, I must turn to.” And so
      saying he went on deck, and we followed.
      
      It was now clear sunrise. Soon the crew came on board in twos and
      threes; the riggers bestirred themselves; the mates were actively
      engaged; and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various
      last things on board. Meanwhile Captain Ahab remained invisibly
      enshrined within his cabin.
      
      
      CHAPTER 22. Merry Christmas.
      
      At length, towards noon, upon the final dismissal of the ship’s
      riggers, and after the Pequod had been hauled out from the wharf, and
      after the ever-thoughtful Charity had come off in a whale-boat, with
      her last gift—a night-cap for Stubb, the second mate, her
      brother-in-law, and a spare Bible for the steward—after all this, the
      two Captains, Peleg and Bildad, issued from the cabin, and turning to
      the chief mate, Peleg said:
      
      “Now, Mr. Starbuck, are you sure everything is right? Captain Ahab is
      all ready—just spoke to him—nothing more to be got from shore, eh?
      Well, call all hands, then. Muster ’em aft here—blast ’em!”
      
      “No need of profane words, however great the hurry, Peleg,” said
      Bildad, “but away with thee, friend Starbuck, and do our bidding.”
      
      How now! Here upon the very point of starting for the voyage, Captain
      Peleg and Captain Bildad were going it with a high hand on the
      quarter-deck, just as if they were to be joint-commanders at sea, as
      well as to all appearances in port. And, as for Captain Ahab, no sign
      of him was yet to be seen; only, they said he was in the cabin. But
      then, the idea was, that his presence was by no means necessary in
      getting the ship under weigh, and steering her well out to sea. Indeed,
      as that was not at all his proper business, but the pilot’s; and as he
      was not yet completely recovered—so they said—therefore, Captain Ahab
      stayed below. And all this seemed natural enough; especially as in the
      merchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a
      considerable time after heaving up the anchor, but remain over the
      cabin table, having a farewell merry-making with their shore friends,
      before they quit the ship for good with the pilot.
      
      But there was not much chance to think over the matter, for Captain
      Peleg was now all alive. He seemed to do most of the talking and
      commanding, and not Bildad.
      
      “Aft here, ye sons of bachelors,” he cried, as the sailors lingered at
      the main-mast. “Mr. Starbuck, drive ’em aft.”
      
      “Strike the tent there!”—was the next order. As I hinted before, this
      whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port; and on board the
      Pequod, for thirty years, the order to strike the tent was well known
      to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor.
      
      “Man the capstan! Blood and thunder!—jump!”—was the next command, and
      the crew sprang for the handspikes.
      
      Now in getting under weigh, the station generally occupied by the pilot
      is the forward part of the ship. And here Bildad, who, with Peleg, be
      it known, in addition to his other officers, was one of the licensed
      pilots of the port—he being suspected to have got himself made a pilot
      in order to save the Nantucket pilot-fee to all the ships he was
      concerned in, for he never piloted any other craft—Bildad, I say, might
      now be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the
      approaching anchor, and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave
      of psalmody, to cheer the hands at the windlass, who roared forth some
      sort of a chorus about the girls in Booble Alley, with hearty good
      will. Nevertheless, not three days previous, Bildad had told them that
      no profane songs would be allowed on board the Pequod, particularly in
      getting under weigh; and Charity, his sister, had placed a small choice
      copy of Watts in each seaman’s berth.
      
      Meantime, overseeing the other part of the ship, Captain Peleg ripped
      and swore astern in the most frightful manner. I almost thought he
      would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up; involuntarily I
      paused on my handspike, and told Queequeg to do the same, thinking of
      the perils we both ran, in starting on the voyage with such a devil for
      a pilot. I was comforting myself, however, with the thought that in
      pious Bildad might be found some salvation, spite of his seven hundred
      and seventy-seventh lay; when I felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear,
      and turning round, was horrified at the apparition of Captain Peleg in
      the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity. That was my
      first kick.
      
      “Is that the way they heave in the marchant service?” he roared.
      “Spring, thou sheep-head; spring, and break thy backbone! Why don’t ye
      spring, I say, all of ye—spring! Quohog! spring, thou chap with the red
      whiskers; spring there, Scotch-cap; spring, thou green pants. Spring, I
      say, all of ye, and spring your eyes out!” And so saying, he moved
      along the windlass, here and there using his leg very freely, while
      imperturbable Bildad kept leading off with his psalmody. Thinks I,
      Captain Peleg must have been drinking something to-day.
      
      At last the anchor was up, the sails were set, and off we glided. It
      was a short, cold Christmas; and as the short northern day merged into
      night, we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean, whose
      freezing spray cased us in ice, as in polished armor. The long rows of
      teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight; and like the white
      ivory tusks of some huge elephant, vast curving icicles depended from
      the bows.
      
      Lank Bildad, as pilot, headed the first watch, and ever and anon, as
      the old craft deep dived into the green seas, and sent the shivering
      frost all over her, and the winds howled, and the cordage rang, his
      steady notes were heard,—
      
      
      _“Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood, Stand dressed in living
      green. So to the Jews old Canaan stood, While Jordan rolled between.”_
      
      
      
      Never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then. They
      were full of hope and fruition. Spite of this frigid winter night in
      the boisterous Atlantic, spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket, there
      was yet, it then seemed to me, many a pleasant haven in store; and
      meads and glades so eternally vernal, that the grass shot up by the
      spring, untrodden, unwilted, remains at midsummer.
      
      At last we gained such an offing, that the two pilots were needed no
      longer. The stout sail-boat that had accompanied us began ranging
      alongside.
      
      It was curious and not unpleasing, how Peleg and Bildad were affected
      at this juncture, especially Captain Bildad. For loath to depart, yet;
      very loath to leave, for good, a ship bound on so long and perilous a
      voyage—beyond both stormy Capes; a ship in which some thousands of his
      hard earned dollars were invested; a ship, in which an old shipmate
      sailed as captain; a man almost as old as he, once more starting to
      encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw; loath to say good-bye to
      a thing so every way brimful of every interest to him,—poor old Bildad
      lingered long; paced the deck with anxious strides; ran down into the
      cabin to speak another farewell word there; again came on deck, and
      looked to windward; looked towards the wide and endless waters, only
      bounded by the far-off unseen Eastern Continents; looked towards the
      land; looked aloft; looked right and left; looked everywhere and
      nowhere; and at last, mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin,
      convulsively grasped stout Peleg by the hand, and holding up a lantern,
      for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face, as much as to say,
      “Nevertheless, friend Peleg, I can stand it; yes, I can.”
      
      As for Peleg himself, he took it more like a philosopher; but for all
      his philosophy, there was a tear twinkling in his eye, when the lantern
      came too near. And he, too, did not a little run from cabin to deck—now
      a word below, and now a word with Starbuck, the chief mate.
      
      But, at last, he turned to his comrade, with a final sort of look about
      him,—“Captain Bildad—come, old shipmate, we must go. Back the main-yard
      there! Boat ahoy! Stand by to come close alongside, now! Careful,
      careful!—come, Bildad, boy—say your last. Luck to ye, Starbuck—luck to
      ye, Mr. Stubb—luck to ye, Mr. Flask—good-bye and good luck to ye
      all—and this day three years I’ll have a hot supper smoking for ye in
      old Nantucket. Hurrah and away!”
      
      “God bless ye, and have ye in His holy keeping, men,” murmured old
      Bildad, almost incoherently. “I hope ye’ll have fine weather now, so
      that Captain Ahab may soon be moving among ye—a pleasant sun is all he
      needs, and ye’ll have plenty of them in the tropic voyage ye go. Be
      careful in the hunt, ye mates. Don’t stave the boats needlessly, ye
      harpooneers; good white cedar plank is raised full three per cent.
      within the year. Don’t forget your prayers, either. Mr. Starbuck, mind
      that cooper don’t waste the spare staves. Oh! the sail-needles are in
      the green locker! Don’t whale it too much a’ Lord’s days, men; but
      don’t miss a fair chance either, that’s rejecting Heaven’s good gifts.
      Have an eye to the molasses tierce, Mr. Stubb; it was a little leaky, I
      thought. If ye touch at the islands, Mr. Flask, beware of fornication.
      Good-bye, good-bye! Don’t keep that cheese too long down in the hold,
      Mr. Starbuck; it’ll spoil. Be careful with the butter—twenty cents the
      pound it was, and mind ye, if—”
      
      “Come, come, Captain Bildad; stop palavering,—away!” and with that,
      Peleg hurried him over the side, and both dropt into the boat.
      
      Ship and boat diverged; the cold, damp night breeze blew between; a
      screaming gull flew overhead; the two hulls wildly rolled; we gave
      three heavy-hearted cheers, and blindly plunged like fate into the lone
      Atlantic.
      
      
      CHAPTER 23. The Lee Shore.
      
      Some chapters back, one Bulkington was spoken of, a tall, newlanded
      mariner, encountered in New Bedford at the inn.
      
      When on that shivering winter’s night, the Pequod thrust her vindictive
      bows into the cold malicious waves, who should I see standing at her
      helm but Bulkington! I looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon
      the man, who in mid-winter just landed from a four years’ dangerous
      voyage, could so unrestingly push off again for still another
      tempestuous term. The land seemed scorching to his feet. Wonderfullest
      things are ever the unmentionable; deep memories yield no epitaphs;
      this six-inch chapter is the stoneless grave of Bulkington. Let me only
      say that it fared with him as with the storm-tossed ship, that
      miserably drives along the leeward land. The port would fain give
      succor; the port is pitiful; in the port is safety, comfort,
      hearthstone, supper, warm blankets, friends, all that’s kind to our
      mortalities. But in that gale, the port, the land, is that ship’s
      direst jeopardy; she must fly all hospitality; one touch of land,
      though it but graze the keel, would make her shudder through and
      through. With all her might she crowds all sail off shore; in so doing,
      fights ’gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward; seeks
      all the lashed sea’s landlessness again; for refuge’s sake forlornly
      rushing into peril; her only friend her bitterest foe!
      
      Know ye now, Bulkington? Glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally
      intolerable truth; that all deep, earnest thinking is but the intrepid
      effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea; while the
      wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the
      treacherous, slavish shore?
      
      But as in landlessness alone resides highest truth, shoreless,
      indefinite as God—so, better is it to perish in that howling infinite,
      than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee, even if that were safety! For
      worm-like, then, oh! who would craven crawl to land! Terrors of the
      terrible! is all this agony so vain? Take heart, take heart, O
      Bulkington! Bear thee grimly, demigod! Up from the spray of thy
      ocean-perishing—straight up, leaps thy apotheosis!
      
      
      CHAPTER 24. The Advocate.
      
      As Queequeg and I are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling;
      and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among
      landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit; therefore, I
      am all anxiety to convince ye, ye landsmen, of the injustice hereby
      done to us hunters of whales.
      
      In the first place, it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish
      the fact, that among people at large, the business of whaling is not
      accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions. If a
      stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society,
      it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits, were
      he presented to the company as a harpooneer, say; and if in emulation
      of the naval officers he should append the initials S.W.F. (Sperm Whale
      Fishery) to his visiting card, such a procedure would be deemed
      pre-eminently presuming and ridiculous.
      
      Doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring us
      whalemen, is this: they think that, at best, our vocation amounts to a
      butchering sort of business; and that when actively engaged therein, we
      are surrounded by all manner of defilements. Butchers we are, that is
      true. But butchers, also, and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been
      all Martial Commanders whom the world invariably delights to honor. And
      as for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business, ye
      shall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally
      unknown, and which, upon the whole, will triumphantly plant the sperm
      whale-ship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth. But
      even granting the charge in question to be true; what disordered
      slippery decks of a whale-ship are comparable to the unspeakable
      carrion of those battle-fields from which so many soldiers return to
      drink in all ladies’ plaudits? And if the idea of peril so much
      enhances the popular conceit of the soldier’s profession; let me assure
      ye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery, would
      quickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whale’s vast tail,
      fanning into eddies the air over his head. For what are the
      comprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and
      wonders of God!
      
      But, though the world scouts at us whale hunters, yet does it
      unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage; yea, an all-abounding
      adoration! for almost all the tapers, lamps, and candles that burn
      round the globe, burn, as before so many shrines, to our glory!
      
      But look at this matter in other lights; weigh it in all sorts of
      scales; see what we whalemen are, and have been.
      
      Why did the Dutch in De Witt’s time have admirals of their whaling
      fleets? Why did Louis XVI. of France, at his own personal expense, fit
      out whaling ships from Dunkirk, and politely invite to that town some
      score or two of families from our own island of Nantucket? Why did
      Britain between the years 1750 and 1788 pay to her whalemen in bounties
      upwards of £1,000,000? And lastly, how comes it that we whalemen of
      America now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world;
      sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels; manned by eighteen
      thousand men; yearly consuming 4,000,000 of dollars; the ships worth,
      at the time of sailing, $20,000,000! and every year importing into our
      harbors a well reaped harvest of $7,000,000. How comes all this, if
      there be not something puissant in whaling?
      
      But this is not the half; look again.
      
      I freely assert, that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot, for his life,
      point out one single peaceful influence, which within the last sixty
      years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world, taken
      in one aggregate, than the high and mighty business of whaling. One way
      and another, it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves, and so
      continuously momentous in their sequential issues, that whaling may
      well be regarded as that Egyptian mother, who bore offspring themselves
      pregnant from her womb. It would be a hopeless, endless task to
      catalogue all these things. Let a handful suffice. For many years past
      the whale-ship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and
      least known parts of the earth. She has explored seas and archipelagoes
      which had no chart, where no Cook or Vancouver had ever sailed. If
      American and European men-of-war now peacefully ride in once savage
      harbors, let them fire salutes to the honor and glory of the
      whale-ship, which originally showed them the way, and first interpreted
      between them and the savages. They may celebrate as they will the
      heroes of Exploring Expeditions, your Cooks, your Krusensterns; but I
      say that scores of anonymous Captains have sailed out of Nantucket,
      that were as great, and greater than your Cook and your Krusenstern.
      For in their succourless empty-handedness, they, in the heathenish
      sharked waters, and by the beaches of unrecorded, javelin islands,
      battled with virgin wonders and terrors that Cook with all his marines
      and muskets would not willingly have dared. All that is made such a
      flourish of in the old South Sea Voyages, those things were but the
      life-time commonplaces of our heroic Nantucketers. Often, adventures
      which Vancouver dedicates three chapters to, these men accounted
      unworthy of being set down in the ship’s common log. Ah, the world! Oh,
      the world!
      
      Until the whale fishery rounded Cape Horn, no commerce but colonial,
      scarcely any intercourse but colonial, was carried on between Europe
      and the long line of the opulent Spanish provinces on the Pacific
      coast. It was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy
      of the Spanish crown, touching those colonies; and, if space permitted,
      it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated
      the liberation of Peru, Chili, and Bolivia from the yoke of Old Spain,
      and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts.
      
      That great America on the other side of the sphere, Australia, was
      given to the enlightened world by the whaleman. After its first
      blunder-born discovery by a Dutchman, all other ships long shunned
      those shores as pestiferously barbarous; but the whale-ship touched
      there. The whale-ship is the true mother of that now mighty colony.
      Moreover, in the infancy of the first Australian settlement, the
      emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent
      biscuit of the whale-ship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters.
      The uncounted isles of all Polynesia confess the same truth, and do
      commercial homage to the whale-ship, that cleared the way for the
      missionary and the merchant, and in many cases carried the primitive
      missionaries to their first destinations. If that double-bolted land,
      Japan, is ever to become hospitable, it is the whale-ship alone to whom
      the credit will be due; for already she is on the threshold.
      
      But if, in the face of all this, you still declare that whaling has no
      æsthetically noble associations connected with it, then am I ready to
      shiver fifty lances with you there, and unhorse you with a split helmet
      every time.
      
      The whale has no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler, you
      will say.
      
      _The whale no famous author, and whaling no famous chronicler?_ Who
      wrote the first account of our Leviathan? Who but mighty Job! And who
      composed the first narrative of a whaling-voyage? Who, but no less a
      prince than Alfred the Great, who, with his own royal pen, took down
      the words from Other, the Norwegian whale-hunter of those times! And
      who pronounced our glowing eulogy in Parliament? Who, but Edmund Burke!
      
      True enough, but then whalemen themselves are poor devils; they have no
      good blood in their veins.
      
      _No good blood in their veins?_ They have something better than royal
      blood there. The grandmother of Benjamin Franklin was Mary Morrel;
      afterwards, by marriage, Mary Folger, one of the old settlers of
      Nantucket, and the ancestress to a long line of Folgers and
      harpooneers—all kith and kin to noble Benjamin—this day darting the
      barbed iron from one side of the world to the other.
      
      Good again; but then all confess that somehow whaling is not
      respectable.
      
      _Whaling not respectable?_ Whaling is imperial! By old English
      statutory law, the whale is declared “a royal fish.” *
      
      Oh, that’s only nominal! The whale himself has never figured in any
      grand imposing way.
      
      _The whale never figured in any grand imposing way?_ In one of the
      mighty triumphs given to a Roman general upon his entering the world’s
      capital, the bones of a whale, brought all the way from the Syrian
      coast, were the most conspicuous object in the cymballed procession.*
      
      *See subsequent chapters for something more on this head.
      
      Grant it, since you cite it; but, say what you will, there is no real
      dignity in whaling.
      
      _No dignity in whaling?_ The dignity of our calling the very heavens
      attest. Cetus is a constellation in the South! No more! Drive down your
      hat in presence of the Czar, and take it off to Queequeg! No more! I
      know a man that, in his lifetime, has taken three hundred and fifty
      whales. I account that man more honorable than that great captain of
      antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns.
      
      And, as for me, if, by any possibility, there be any as yet
      undiscovered prime thing in me; if I shall ever deserve any real repute
      in that small but high hushed world which I might not be unreasonably
      ambitious of; if hereafter I shall do anything that, upon the whole, a
      man might rather have done than to have left undone; if, at my death,
      my executors, or more properly my creditors, find any precious MSS. in
      my desk, then here I prospectively ascribe all the honor and the glory
      to whaling; for a whale-ship was my Yale College and my Harvard.
      
      
      CHAPTER 25. Postscript.
      
      In behalf of the dignity of whaling, I would fain advance naught but
      substantiated facts. But after embattling his facts, an advocate who
      should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise, which might tell
      eloquently upon his cause—such an advocate, would he not be
      blameworthy?
      
      It is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens, even
      modern ones, a certain curious process of seasoning them for their
      functions is gone through. There is a saltcellar of state, so called,
      and there may be a castor of state. How they use the salt,
      precisely—who knows? Certain I am, however, that a king’s head is
      solemnly oiled at his coronation, even as a head of salad. Can it be,
      though, that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run
      well, as they anoint machinery? Much might be ruminated here,
      concerning the essential dignity of this regal process, because in
      common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints
      his hair, and palpably smells of that anointing. In truth, a mature man
      who uses hair-oil, unless medicinally, that man has probably got a
      quoggy spot in him somewhere. As a general rule, he can’t amount to
      much in his totality.
      
      But the only thing to be considered here, is this—what kind of oil is
      used at coronations? Certainly it cannot be olive oil, nor macassar
      oil, nor castor oil, nor bear’s oil, nor train oil, nor cod-liver oil.
      What then can it possibly be, but sperm oil in its unmanufactured,
      unpolluted state, the sweetest of all oils?
      
      Think of that, ye loyal Britons! we whalemen supply your kings and
      queens with coronation stuff!
      
      
      CHAPTER 26. Knights and Squires.
      
      The chief mate of the Pequod was Starbuck, a native of Nantucket, and a
      Quaker by descent. He was a long, earnest man, and though born on an
      icy coast, seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes, his flesh being
      hard as twice-baked biscuit. Transported to the Indies, his live blood
      would not spoil like bottled ale. He must have been born in some time
      of general drought and famine, or upon one of those fast days for which
      his state is famous. Only some thirty arid summers had he seen; those
      summers had dried up all his physical superfluousness. But this, his
      thinness, so to speak, seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties
      and cares, than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight. It was
      merely the condensation of the man. He was by no means ill-looking;
      quite the contrary. His pure tight skin was an excellent fit; and
      closely wrapped up in it, and embalmed with inner health and strength,
      like a revivified Egyptian, this Starbuck seemed prepared to endure for
      long ages to come, and to endure always, as now; for be it Polar snow
      or torrid sun, like a patent chronometer, his interior vitality was
      warranted to do well in all climates. Looking into his eyes, you seemed
      to see there the yet lingering images of those thousand-fold perils he
      had calmly confronted through life. A staid, steadfast man, whose life
      for the most part was a telling pantomime of action, and not a tame
      chapter of sounds. Yet, for all his hardy sobriety and fortitude, there
      were certain qualities in him which at times affected, and in some
      cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest. Uncommonly
      conscientious for a seaman, and endued with a deep natural reverence,
      the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline
      him to superstition; but to that sort of superstition, which in some
      organizations seems rather to spring, somehow, from intelligence than
      from ignorance. Outward portents and inward presentiments were his. And
      if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul, much more
      did his far-away domestic memories of his young Cape wife and child,
      tend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature,
      and open him still further to those latent influences which, in some
      honest-hearted men, restrain the gush of dare-devil daring, so often
      evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery. “I
      will have no man in my boat,” said Starbuck, “who is not afraid of a
      whale.” By this, he seemed to mean, not only that the most reliable and
      useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the
      encountered peril, but that an utterly fearless man is a far more
      dangerous comrade than a coward.
      
      “Aye, aye,” said Stubb, the second mate, “Starbuck, there, is as
      careful a man as you’ll find anywhere in this fishery.” But we shall
      ere long see what that word “careful” precisely means when used by a
      man like Stubb, or almost any other whale hunter.
      
      Starbuck was no crusader after perils; in him courage was not a
      sentiment; but a thing simply useful to him, and always at hand upon
      all mortally practical occasions. Besides, he thought, perhaps, that in
      this business of whaling, courage was one of the great staple outfits
      of the ship, like her beef and her bread, and not to be foolishly
      wasted. Wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after
      sun-down; nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted
      in fighting him. For, thought Starbuck, I am here in this critical
      ocean to kill whales for my living, and not to be killed by them for
      theirs; and that hundreds of men had been so killed Starbuck well knew.
      What doom was his own father’s? Where, in the bottomless deeps, could
      he find the torn limbs of his brother?
      
      With memories like these in him, and, moreover, given to a certain
      superstitiousness, as has been said; the courage of this Starbuck which
      could, nevertheless, still flourish, must indeed have been extreme. But
      it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized, and with such
      terrible experiences and remembrances as he had; it was not in nature
      that these things should fail in latently engendering an element in
      him, which, under suitable circumstances, would break out from its
      confinement, and burn all his courage up. And brave as he might be, it
      was that sort of bravery chiefly, visible in some intrepid men, which,
      while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas, or winds, or
      whales, or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world, yet
      cannot withstand those more terrific, because more spiritual terrors,
      which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged
      and mighty man.
      
      But were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance, the complete
      abasement of poor Starbuck’s fortitude, scarce might I have the heart
      to write it; for it is a thing most sorrowful, nay shocking, to expose
      the fall of valour in the soul. Men may seem detestable as joint
      stock-companies and nations; knaves, fools, and murderers there may be;
      men may have mean and meagre faces; but man, in the ideal, is so noble
      and so sparkling, such a grand and glowing creature, that over any
      ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their
      costliest robes. That immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves, so
      far within us, that it remains intact though all the outer character
      seem gone; bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a
      valor-ruined man. Nor can piety itself, at such a shameful sight,
      completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars. But
      this august dignity I treat of, is not the dignity of kings and robes,
      but that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture. Thou shalt
      see it shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike; that
      democratic dignity which, on all hands, radiates without end from God;
      Himself! The great God absolute! The centre and circumference of all
      democracy! His omnipresence, our divine equality!
      
      If, then, to meanest mariners, and renegades and castaways, I shall
      hereafter ascribe high qualities, though dark; weave round them tragic
      graces; if even the most mournful, perchance the most abased, among
      them all, shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts; if I shall
      touch that workman’s arm with some ethereal light; if I shall spread a
      rainbow over his disastrous set of sun; then against all mortal critics
      bear me out in it, thou just Spirit of Equality, which hast spread one
      royal mantle of humanity over all my kind! Bear me out in it, thou
      great democratic God! who didst not refuse to the swart convict,
      Bunyan, the pale, poetic pearl; Thou who didst clothe with doubly
      hammered leaves of finest gold, the stumped and paupered arm of old
      Cervantes; Thou who didst pick up Andrew Jackson from the pebbles; who
      didst hurl him upon a war-horse; who didst thunder him higher than a
      throne! Thou who, in all Thy mighty, earthly marchings, ever cullest
      Thy selectest champions from the kingly commons; bear me out in it, O
      God!
      
      
      CHAPTER 27. Knights and Squires.
      
      Stubb was the second mate. He was a native of Cape Cod; and hence,
      according to local usage, was called a Cape-Cod-man. A happy-go-lucky;
      neither craven nor valiant; taking perils as they came with an
      indifferent air; and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the
      chase, toiling away, calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged
      for the year. Good-humored, easy, and careless, he presided over his
      whale-boat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner, and his
      crew all invited guests. He was as particular about the comfortable
      arrangement of his part of the boat, as an old stage-driver is about
      the snugness of his box. When close to the whale, in the very
      death-lock of the fight, he handled his unpitying lance coolly and
      off-handedly, as a whistling tinker his hammer. He would hum over his
      old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated
      monster. Long usage had, for this Stubb, converted the jaws of death
      into an easy chair. What he thought of death itself, there is no
      telling. Whether he ever thought of it at all, might be a question;
      but, if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a
      comfortable dinner, no doubt, like a good sailor, he took it to be a
      sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft, and bestir themselves there,
      about something which he would find out when he obeyed the order, and
      not sooner.
      
      What, perhaps, with other things, made Stubb such an easy-going,
      unfearing man, so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a
      world full of grave pedlars, all bowed to the ground with their packs;
      what helped to bring about that almost impious good-humor of his; that
      thing must have been his pipe. For, like his nose, his short, black
      little pipe was one of the regular features of his face. You would
      almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his
      nose as without his pipe. He kept a whole row of pipes there ready
      loaded, stuck in a rack, within easy reach of his hand; and, whenever
      he turned in, he smoked them all out in succession, lighting one from
      the other to the end of the chapter; then loading them again to be in
      readiness anew. For, when Stubb dressed, instead of first putting his
      legs into his trowsers, he put his pipe into his mouth.
      
      I say this continual smoking must have been one cause, at least, of his
      peculiar disposition; for every one knows that this earthly air,
      whether ashore or afloat, is terribly infected with the nameless
      miseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it; and as in
      time of the cholera, some people go about with a camphorated
      handkerchief to their mouths; so, likewise, against all mortal
      tribulations, Stubb’s tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of
      disinfecting agent.
      
      The third mate was Flask, a native of Tisbury, in Martha’s Vineyard. A
      short, stout, ruddy young fellow, very pugnacious concerning whales,
      who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally
      and hereditarily affronted him; and therefore it was a sort of point of
      honor with him, to destroy them whenever encountered. So utterly lost
      was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic
      bulk and mystic ways; and so dead to anything like an apprehension of
      any possible danger from encountering them; that in his poor opinion,
      the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse, or at least
      water-rat, requiring only a little circumvention and some small
      application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil. This
      ignorant, unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in
      the matter of whales; he followed these fish for the fun of it; and a
      three years’ voyage round Cape Horn was only a jolly joke that lasted
      that length of time. As a carpenter’s nails are divided into wrought
      nails and cut nails; so mankind may be similarly divided. Little Flask
      was one of the wrought ones; made to clinch tight and last long. They
      called him King-Post on board of the Pequod; because, in form, he could
      be well likened to the short, square timber known by that name in
      Arctic whalers; and which by the means of many radiating side timbers
      inserted into it, serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions
      of those battering seas.
      
      Now these three mates—Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, were momentous men.
      They it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the
      Pequod’s boats as headsmen. In that grand order of battle in which
      Captain Ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the
      whales, these three headsmen were as captains of companies. Or, being
      armed with their long keen whaling spears, they were as a picked trio
      of lancers; even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins.
      
      And since in this famous fishery, each mate or headsman, like a Gothic
      Knight of old, is always accompanied by his boat-steerer or harpooneer,
      who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance, when the
      former one has been badly twisted, or elbowed in the assault; and
      moreover, as there generally subsists between the two, a close intimacy
      and friendliness; it is therefore but meet, that in this place we set
      down who the Pequod’s harpooneers were, and to what headsman each of
      them belonged.
      
      First of all was Queequeg, whom Starbuck, the chief mate, had selected
      for his squire. But Queequeg is already known.
      
      Next was Tashtego, an unmixed Indian from Gay Head, the most westerly
      promontory of Martha’s Vineyard, where there still exists the last
      remnant of a village of red men, which has long supplied the
      neighboring island of Nantucket with many of her most daring
      harpooneers. In the fishery, they usually go by the generic name of
      Gay-Headers. Tashtego’s long, lean, sable hair, his high cheek bones,
      and black rounding eyes—for an Indian, Oriental in their largeness, but
      Antarctic in their glittering expression—all this sufficiently
      proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud
      warrior hunters, who, in quest of the great New England moose, had
      scoured, bow in hand, the aboriginal forests of the main. But no longer
      snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland, Tashtego now
      hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea; the unerring harpoon
      of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires. To look
      at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs, you would almost have
      credited the superstitions of some of the earlier Puritans, and
      half-believed this wild Indian to be a son of the Prince of the Powers
      of the Air. Tashtego was Stubb the second mate’s squire.
      
      Third among the harpooneers was Daggoo, a gigantic, coal-black
      negro-savage, with a lion-like tread—an Ahasuerus to behold. Suspended
      from his ears were two golden hoops, so large that the sailors called
      them ring-bolts, and would talk of securing the top-sail halyards to
      them. In his youth Daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler,
      lying in a lonely bay on his native coast. And never having been
      anywhere in the world but in Africa, Nantucket, and the pagan harbors
      most frequented by whalemen; and having now led for many years the bold
      life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what
      manner of men they shipped; Daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues,
      and erect as a giraffe, moved about the decks in all the pomp of six
      feet five in his socks. There was a corporeal humility in looking up at
      him; and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to
      beg truce of a fortress. Curious to tell, this imperial negro,
      Ahasuerus Daggoo, was the Squire of little Flask, who looked like a
      chess-man beside him. As for the residue of the Pequod’s company, be it
      said, that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men
      before the mast employed in the American whale fishery, are Americans
      born, though pretty nearly all the officers are. Herein it is the same
      with the American whale fishery as with the American army and military
      and merchant navies, and the engineering forces employed in the
      construction of the American Canals and Railroads. The same, I say,
      because in all these cases the native American liberally provides the
      brains, the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles. No
      small number of these whaling seamen belong to the Azores, where the
      outward bound Nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews
      from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores. In like manner, the
      Greenland whalers sailing out of Hull or London, put in at the Shetland
      Islands, to receive the full complement of their crew. Upon the passage
      homewards, they drop them there again. How it is, there is no telling,
      but Islanders seem to make the best whalemen. They were nearly all
      Islanders in the Pequod, _Isolatoes_ too, I call such, not
      acknowledging the common continent of men, but each _Isolato_ living on
      a separate continent of his own. Yet now, federated along one keel,
      what a set these Isolatoes were! An Anacharsis Clootz deputation from
      all the isles of the sea, and all the ends of the earth, accompanying
      Old Ahab in the Pequod to lay the world’s grievances before that bar
      from which not very many of them ever come back. Black Little Pip—he
      never did—oh, no! he went before. Poor Alabama boy! On the grim
      Pequod’s forecastle, ye shall ere long see him, beating his tambourine;
      prelusive of the eternal time, when sent for, to the great quarter-deck
      on high, he was bid strike in with angels, and beat his tambourine in
      glory; called a coward here, hailed a hero there!
      
      
      CHAPTER 28. Ahab.
      
      For several days after leaving Nantucket, nothing above hatches was
      seen of Captain Ahab. The mates regularly relieved each other at the
      watches, and for aught that could be seen to the contrary, they seemed
      to be the only commanders of the ship; only they sometimes issued from
      the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory, that after all it was
      plain they but commanded vicariously. Yes, their supreme lord and
      dictator was there, though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to
      penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin.
      
      Every time I ascended to the deck from my watches below, I instantly
      gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible; for my first vague
      disquietude touching the unknown captain, now in the seclusion of the
      sea, became almost a perturbation. This was strangely heightened at
      times by the ragged Elijah’s diabolical incoherences uninvitedly
      recurring to me, with a subtle energy I could not have before conceived
      of. But poorly could I withstand them, much as in other moods I was
      almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish
      prophet of the wharves. But whatever it was of apprehensiveness or
      uneasiness—to call it so—which I felt, yet whenever I came to look
      about me in the ship, it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such
      emotions. For though the harpooneers, with the great body of the crew,
      were a far more barbaric, heathenish, and motley set than any of the
      tame merchant-ship companies which my previous experiences had made me
      acquainted with, still I ascribed this—and rightly ascribed it—to the
      fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild Scandinavian vocation
      in which I had so abandonedly embarked. But it was especially the
      aspect of the three chief officers of the ship, the mates, which was
      most forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings, and
      induce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage.
      Three better, more likely sea-officers and men, each in his own
      different way, could not readily be found, and they were every one of
      them Americans; a Nantucketer, a Vineyarder, a Cape man. Now, it being
      Christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor, for a space we had
      biting Polar weather, though all the time running away from it to the
      southward; and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed,
      gradually leaving that merciless winter, and all its intolerable
      weather behind us. It was one of those less lowering, but still grey
      and gloomy enough mornings of the transition, when with a fair wind the
      ship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping
      and melancholy rapidity, that as I mounted to the deck at the call of
      the forenoon watch, so soon as I levelled my glance towards the
      taffrail, foreboding shivers ran over me. Reality outran apprehension;
      Captain Ahab stood upon his quarter-deck.
      
      There seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him, nor of the
      recovery from any. He looked like a man cut away from the stake, when
      the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them,
      or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness. His
      whole high, broad form, seemed made of solid bronze, and shaped in an
      unalterable mould, like Cellini’s cast Perseus. Threading its way out
      from among his grey hairs, and continuing right down one side of his
      tawny scorched face and neck, till it disappeared in his clothing, you
      saw a slender rod-like mark, lividly whitish. It resembled that
      perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight, lofty trunk of a
      great tree, when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it, and
      without wrenching a single twig, peels and grooves out the bark from
      top to bottom, ere running off into the soil, leaving the tree still
      greenly alive, but branded. Whether that mark was born with him, or
      whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound, no one could
      certainly say. By some tacit consent, throughout the voyage little or
      no allusion was made to it, especially by the mates. But once
      Tashtego’s senior, an old Gay-Head Indian among the crew,
      superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did
      Ahab become that way branded, and then it came upon him, not in the
      fury of any mortal fray, but in an elemental strife at sea. Yet, this
      wild hint seemed inferentially negatived, by what a grey Manxman
      insinuated, an old sepulchral man, who, having never before sailed out
      of Nantucket, had never ere this laid eye upon wild Ahab. Nevertheless,
      the old sea-traditions, the immemorial credulities, popularly invested
      this old Manxman with preternatural powers of discernment. So that no
      white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever
      Captain Ahab should be tranquilly laid out—which might hardly come to
      pass, so he muttered—then, whoever should do that last office for the
      dead, would find a birth-mark on him from crown to sole.
      
      So powerfully did the whole grim aspect of Ahab affect me, and the
      livid brand which streaked it, that for the first few moments I hardly
      noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the
      barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood. It had previously come
      to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished
      bone of the sperm whale’s jaw. “Aye, he was dismasted off Japan,” said
      the old Gay-Head Indian once; “but like his dismasted craft, he shipped
      another mast without coming home for it. He has a quiver of ’em.”
      
      I was struck with the singular posture he maintained. Upon each side of
      the Pequod’s quarter deck, and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds,
      there was an auger hole, bored about half an inch or so, into the
      plank. His bone leg steadied in that hole; one arm elevated, and
      holding by a shroud; Captain Ahab stood erect, looking straight out
      beyond the ship’s ever-pitching prow. There was an infinity of firmest
      fortitude, a determinate, unsurrenderable wilfulness, in the fixed and
      fearless, forward dedication of that glance. Not a word he spoke; nor
      did his officers say aught to him; though by all their minutest
      gestures and expressions, they plainly showed the uneasy, if not
      painful, consciousness of being under a troubled master-eye. And not
      only that, but moody stricken Ahab stood before them with a crucifixion
      in his face; in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some
      mighty woe.
      
      Ere long, from his first visit in the air, he withdrew into his cabin.
      But after that morning, he was every day visible to the crew; either
      standing in his pivot-hole, or seated upon an ivory stool he had; or
      heavily walking the deck. As the sky grew less gloomy; indeed, began to
      grow a little genial, he became still less and less a recluse; as if,
      when the ship had sailed from home, nothing but the dead wintry
      bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded. And, by and by, it
      came to pass, that he was almost continually in the air; but, as yet,
      for all that he said, or perceptibly did, on the at last sunny deck, he
      seemed as unnecessary there as another mast. But the Pequod was only
      making a passage now; not regularly cruising; nearly all whaling
      preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to, so
      that there was little or nothing, out of himself, to employ or excite
      Ahab, now; and thus chase away, for that one interval, the clouds that
      layer upon layer were piled upon his brow, as ever all clouds choose
      the loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon.
      
      Nevertheless, ere long, the warm, warbling persuasiveness of the
      pleasant, holiday weather we came to, seemed gradually to charm him
      from his mood. For, as when the red-cheeked, dancing girls, April and
      May, trip home to the wintry, misanthropic woods; even the barest,
      ruggedest, most thunder-cloven old oak will at least send forth some
      few green sprouts, to welcome such glad-hearted visitants; so Ahab did,
      in the end, a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish
      air. More than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look,
      which, in any other man, would have soon flowered out in a smile.
      
      
      CHAPTER 29. Enter Ahab; to Him, Stubb.
      
      Some days elapsed, and ice and icebergs all astern, the Pequod now went
      rolling through the bright Quito spring, which, at sea, almost
      perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal August of the
      Tropic. The warmly cool, clear, ringing, perfumed, overflowing,
      redundant days, were as crystal goblets of Persian sherbet, heaped
      up—flaked up, with rose-water snow. The starred and stately nights
      seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets, nursing at home in lonely
      pride, the memory of their absent conquering Earls, the golden helmeted
      suns! For sleeping man, ’twas hard to choose between such winsome days
      and such seducing nights. But all the witcheries of that unwaning
      weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward
      world. Inward they turned upon the soul, especially when the still mild
      hours of eve came on; then, memory shot her crystals as the clear ice
      most forms of noiseless twilights. And all these subtle agencies, more
      and more they wrought on Ahab’s texture.
      
      Old age is always wakeful; as if, the longer linked with life, the less
      man has to do with aught that looks like death. Among sea-commanders,
      the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the
      night-cloaked deck. It was so with Ahab; only that now, of late, he
      seemed so much to live in the open air, that truly speaking, his visits
      were more to the cabin, than from the cabin to the planks. “It feels
      like going down into one’s tomb,”—he would mutter to himself—“for an
      old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle, to go to my
      grave-dug berth.”
      
      So, almost every twenty-four hours, when the watches of the night were
      set, and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below;
      and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle, the sailors
      flung it not rudely down, as by day, but with some cautiousness dropt
      it to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates; when
      this sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail, habitually, the
      silent steersman would watch the cabin-scuttle; and ere long the old
      man would emerge, gripping at the iron banister, to help his crippled
      way. Some considering touch of humanity was in him; for at times like
      these, he usually abstained from patrolling the quarter-deck; because
      to his wearied mates, seeking repose within six inches of his ivory
      heel, such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony
      step, that their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of
      sharks. But once, the mood was on him too deep for common regardings;
      and as with heavy, lumber-like pace he was measuring the ship from
      taffrail to mainmast, Stubb, the old second mate, came up from below,
      with a certain unassured, deprecating humorousness, hinted that if
      Captain Ahab was pleased to walk the planks, then, no one could say
      nay; but there might be some way of muffling the noise; hinting
      something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow, and the
      insertion into it, of the ivory heel. Ah! Stubb, thou didst not know
      Ahab then.
      
      “Am I a cannon-ball, Stubb,” said Ahab, “that thou wouldst wad me that
      fashion? But go thy ways; I had forgot. Below to thy nightly grave;
      where such as ye sleep between shrouds, to use ye to the filling one at
      last.—Down, dog, and kennel!”
      
      Starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly
      scornful old man, Stubb was speechless a moment; then said excitedly,
      “I am not used to be spoken to that way, sir; I do but less than half
      like it, sir.”
      
      “Avast! gritted Ahab between his set teeth, and violently moving away,
      as if to avoid some passionate temptation.
      
      “No, sir; not yet,” said Stubb, emboldened, “I will not tamely be
      called a dog, sir.”
      
      “Then be called ten times a donkey, and a mule, and an ass, and begone,
      or I’ll clear the world of thee!”
      
      As he said this, Ahab advanced upon him with such overbearing terrors
      in his aspect, that Stubb involuntarily retreated.
      
      “I was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it,”
      muttered Stubb, as he found himself descending the cabin-scuttle. “It’s
      very queer. Stop, Stubb; somehow, now, I don’t well know whether to go
      back and strike him, or—what’s that?—down here on my knees and pray for
      him? Yes, that was the thought coming up in me; but it would be the
      first time I ever _did_ pray. It’s queer; very queer; and he’s queer
      too; aye, take him fore and aft, he’s about the queerest old man Stubb
      ever sailed with. How he flashed at me!—his eyes like powder-pans! is
      he mad? Anyway there’s something on his mind, as sure as there must be
      something on a deck when it cracks. He aint in his bed now, either,
      more than three hours out of the twenty-four; and he don’t sleep then.
      Didn’t that Dough-Boy, the steward, tell me that of a morning he always
      finds the old man’s hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled, and the
      sheets down at the foot, and the coverlid almost tied into knots, and
      the pillow a sort of frightful hot, as though a baked brick had been on
      it? A hot old man! I guess he’s got what some folks ashore call a
      conscience; it’s a kind of Tic-Dolly-row they say—worse nor a
      toothache. Well, well; I don’t know what it is, but the Lord keep me
      from catching it. He’s full of riddles; I wonder what he goes into the
      after hold for, every night, as Dough-Boy tells me he suspects; what’s
      that for, I should like to know? Who’s made appointments with him in
      the hold? Ain’t that queer, now? But there’s no telling, it’s the old
      game—Here goes for a snooze. Damn me, it’s worth a fellow’s while to be
      born into the world, if only to fall right asleep. And now that I think
      of it, that’s about the first thing babies do, and that’s a sort of
      queer, too. Damn me, but all things are queer, come to think of ’em.
      But that’s against my principles. Think not, is my eleventh
      commandment; and sleep when you can, is my twelfth—So here goes again.
      But how’s that? didn’t he call me a dog? blazes! he called me ten times
      a donkey, and piled a lot of jackasses on top of _that!_ He might as
      well have kicked me, and done with it. Maybe he _did_ kick me, and I
      didn’t observe it, I was so taken all aback with his brow, somehow. It
      flashed like a bleached bone. What the devil’s the matter with me? I
      don’t stand right on my legs. Coming afoul of that old man has a sort
      of turned me wrong side out. By the Lord, I must have been dreaming,
      though—How? how? how?—but the only way’s to stash it; so here goes to
      hammock again; and in the morning, I’ll see how this plaguey juggling
      thinks over by daylight.”
      
      
      CHAPTER 30. The Pipe.
      
      When Stubb had departed, Ahab stood for a while leaning over the
      bulwarks; and then, as had been usual with him of late, calling a
      sailor of the watch, he sent him below for his ivory stool, and also
      his pipe. Lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool
      on the weather side of the deck, he sat and smoked.
      
      In old Norse times, the thrones of the sea-loving Danish kings were
      fabricated, saith tradition, of the tusks of the narwhale. How could
      one look at Ahab then, seated on that tripod of bones, without
      bethinking him of the royalty it symbolized? For a Khan of the plank,
      and a king of the sea, and a great lord of Leviathans was Ahab.
      
      Some moments passed, during which the thick vapor came from his mouth
      in quick and constant puffs, which blew back again into his face. “How
      now,” he soliloquized at last, withdrawing the tube, “this smoking no
      longer soothes. Oh, my pipe! hard must it go with me if thy charm be
      gone! Here have I been unconsciously toiling, not pleasuring—aye, and
      ignorantly smoking to windward all the while; to windward, and with
      such nervous whiffs, as if, like the dying whale, my final jets were
      the strongest and fullest of trouble. What business have I with this
      pipe? This thing that is meant for sereneness, to send up mild white
      vapors among mild white hairs, not among torn iron-grey locks like
      mine. I’ll smoke no more—”
      
      He tossed the still lighted pipe into the sea. The fire hissed in the
      waves; the same instant the ship shot by the bubble the sinking pipe
      made. With slouched hat, Ahab lurchingly paced the planks.
      
      
      CHAPTER 31. Queen Mab.
      
      Next morning Stubb accosted Flask.
      
      “Such a queer dream, King-Post, I never had. You know the old man’s
      ivory leg, well I dreamed he kicked me with it; and when I tried to
      kick back, upon my soul, my little man, I kicked my leg right off! And
      then, presto! Ahab seemed a pyramid, and I, like a blazing fool, kept
      kicking at it. But what was still more curious, Flask—you know how
      curious all dreams are—through all this rage that I was in, I somehow
      seemed to be thinking to myself, that after all, it was not much of an
      insult, that kick from Ahab. ‘Why,’ thinks I, ‘what’s the row? It’s not
      a real leg, only a false leg.’ And there’s a mighty difference between
      a living thump and a dead thump. That’s what makes a blow from the
      hand, Flask, fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane.
      The living member—that makes the living insult, my little man. And
      thinks I to myself all the while, mind, while I was stubbing my silly
      toes against that cursed pyramid—so confoundedly contradictory was it
      all, all the while, I say, I was thinking to myself, ‘what’s his leg
      now, but a cane—a whalebone cane. Yes,’ thinks I, ‘it was only a
      playful cudgelling—in fact, only a whaleboning that he gave me—not a
      base kick. Besides,’ thinks I, ‘look at it once; why, the end of it—the
      foot part—what a small sort of end it is; whereas, if a broad footed
      farmer kicked me, _there’s_ a devilish broad insult. But this insult is
      whittled down to a point only.’ But now comes the greatest joke of the
      dream, Flask. While I was battering away at the pyramid, a sort of
      badger-haired old merman, with a hump on his back, takes me by the
      shoulders, and slews me round. ‘What are you ’bout?’ says he. Slid!
      man, but I was frightened. Such a phiz! But, somehow, next moment I was
      over the fright. ‘What am I about?’ says I at last. ‘And what business
      is that of yours, I should like to know, Mr. Humpback? Do _you_ want a
      kick?’ By the lord, Flask, I had no sooner said that, than he turned
      round his stern to me, bent over, and dragging up a lot of seaweed he
      had for a clout—what do you think, I saw?—why thunder alive, man, his
      stern was stuck full of marlinspikes, with the points out. Says I, on
      second thoughts, ‘I guess I won’t kick you, old fellow.’ ‘Wise Stubb,’
      said he, ‘wise Stubb;’ and kept muttering it all the time, a sort of
      eating of his own gums like a chimney hag. Seeing he wasn’t going to
      stop saying over his ‘wise Stubb, wise Stubb,’ I thought I might as
      well fall to kicking the pyramid again. But I had only just lifted my
      foot for it, when he roared out, ‘Stop that kicking!’ ‘Halloa,’ says I,
      ‘what’s the matter now, old fellow?’ ‘Look ye here,’ says he; ‘let’s
      argue the insult. Captain Ahab kicked ye, didn’t he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’
      says I—‘right _here_ it was.’ ‘Very good,’ says he—‘he used his ivory
      leg, didn’t he?’ ‘Yes, he did,’ says I. ‘Well then,’ says he, ‘wise
      Stubb, what have you to complain of? Didn’t he kick with right good
      will? it wasn’t a common pitch pine leg he kicked with, was it? No, you
      were kicked by a great man, and with a beautiful ivory leg, Stubb. It’s
      an honor; I consider it an honor. Listen, wise Stubb. In old England
      the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen, and
      made garter-knights of; but, be _your_ boast, Stubb, that ye were
      kicked by old Ahab, and made a wise man of. Remember what I say; _be_
      kicked by him; account his kicks honors; and on no account kick back;
      for you can’t help yourself, wise Stubb. Don’t you see that pyramid?’
      With that, he all of a sudden seemed somehow, in some queer fashion, to
      swim off into the air. I snored; rolled over; and there I was in my
      hammock! Now, what do you think of that dream, Flask?”
      
      “I don’t know; it seems a sort of foolish to me, tho.’”
      
      “May be; may be. But it’s made a wise man of me, Flask. D’ye see Ahab
      standing there, sideways looking over the stern? Well, the best thing
      you can do, Flask, is to let the old man alone; never speak to him,
      whatever he says. Halloa! What’s that he shouts? Hark!”
      
      “Mast-head, there! Look sharp, all of ye! There are whales hereabouts!
      
      “If ye see a white one, split your lungs for him!
      
      “What do you think of that now, Flask? ain’t there a small drop of
      something queer about that, eh? A white whale—did ye mark that, man?
      Look ye—there’s something special in the wind. Stand by for it, Flask.
      Ahab has that that’s bloody on his mind. But, mum; he comes this way.”
      
      
      CHAPTER 32. Cetology.
      
      Already we are boldly launched upon the deep; but soon we shall be lost
      in its unshored, harbourless immensities. Ere that come to pass; ere
      the Pequod’s weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of
      the leviathan; at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter
      almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the
      more special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which
      are to follow.
      
      It is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera,
      that I would now fain put before you. Yet is it no easy task. The
      classification of the constituents of a chaos, nothing less is here
      essayed. Listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down.
      
      “No branch of Zoology is so much involved as that which is entitled
      Cetology,” says Captain Scoresby, A.D. 1820.
      
      “It is not my intention, were it in my power, to enter into the inquiry
      as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families.
      * * * Utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal”
      (sperm whale), says Surgeon Beale, A.D. 1839.
      
      “Unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters.”
      “Impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea.” “A field
      strewn with thorns.” “All these incomplete indications but serve to
      torture us naturalists.”
      
      Thus speak of the whale, the great Cuvier, and John Hunter, and Lesson,
      those lights of zoology and anatomy. Nevertheless, though of real
      knowledge there be little, yet of books there are a plenty; and so in
      some small degree, with cetology, or the science of whales. Many are
      the men, small and great, old and new, landsmen and seamen, who have at
      large or in little, written of the whale. Run over a few:—The Authors
      of the Bible; Aristotle; Pliny; Aldrovandi; Sir Thomas Browne; Gesner;
      Ray; Linnæus; Rondeletius; Willoughby; Green; Artedi; Sibbald; Brisson;
      Marten; Lacépède; Bonneterre; Desmarest; Baron Cuvier; Frederick
      Cuvier; John Hunter; Owen; Scoresby; Beale; Bennett; J. Ross Browne;
      the Author of Miriam Coffin; Olmstead; and the Rev. T. Cheever. But to
      what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written, the above
      cited extracts will show.
      
      Of the names in this list of whale authors, only those following Owen
      ever saw living whales; and but one of them was a real professional
      harpooneer and whaleman. I mean Captain Scoresby. On the separate
      subject of the Greenland or right-whale, he is the best existing
      authority. But Scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great
      sperm whale, compared with which the Greenland whale is almost unworthy
      mentioning. And here be it said, that the Greenland whale is an usurper
      upon the throne of the seas. He is not even by any means the largest of
      the whales. Yet, owing to the long priority of his claims, and the
      profound ignorance which, till some seventy years back, invested the
      then fabulous or utterly unknown sperm-whale, and which ignorance to
      this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats
      and whale-ports; this usurpation has been every way complete. Reference
      to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past
      days, will satisfy you that the Greenland whale, without one rival, was
      to them the monarch of the seas. But the time has at last come for a
      new proclamation. This is Charing Cross; hear ye! good people all,—the
      Greenland whale is deposed,—the great sperm whale now reigneth!
      
      There are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the
      living sperm whale before you, and at the same time, in the remotest
      degree succeed in the attempt. Those books are Beale’s and Bennett’s;
      both in their time surgeons to English South-Sea whale-ships, and both
      exact and reliable men. The original matter touching the sperm whale to
      be found in their volumes is necessarily small; but so far as it goes,
      it is of excellent quality, though mostly confined to scientific
      description. As yet, however, the sperm whale, scientific or poetic,
      lives not complete in any literature. Far above all other hunted
      whales, his is an unwritten life.
      
      Now the various species of whales need some sort of popular
      comprehensive classification, if only an easy outline one for the
      present, hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent
      laborers. As no better man advances to take this matter in hand, I
      hereupon offer my own poor endeavors. I promise nothing complete;
      because any human thing supposed to be complete, must for that very
      reason infallibly be faulty. I shall not pretend to a minute anatomical
      description of the various species, or—in this place at least—to much
      of any description. My object here is simply to project the draught of
      a systematization of cetology. I am the architect, not the builder.
      
      But it is a ponderous task; no ordinary letter-sorter in the
      Post-Office is equal to it. To grope down into the bottom of the sea
      after them; to have one’s hands among the unspeakable foundations,
      ribs, and very pelvis of the world; this is a fearful thing. What am I
      that I should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan! The awful
      tauntings in Job might well appal me. Will he (the leviathan) make a
      covenant with thee? Behold the hope of him is vain! But I have swam
      through libraries and sailed through oceans; I have had to do with
      whales with these visible hands; I am in earnest; and I will try. There
      are some preliminaries to settle.
      
      First: The uncertain, unsettled condition of this science of Cetology
      is in the very vestibule attested by the fact, that in some quarters it
      still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish. In his System of
      Nature, A.D. 1776, Linnæus declares, “I hereby separate the whales from
      the fish.” But of my own knowledge, I know that down to the year 1850,
      sharks and shad, alewives and herring, against Linnæus’s express edict,
      were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the
      Leviathan.
      
      The grounds upon which Linnæus would fain have banished the whales from
      the waters, he states as follows: “On account of their warm bilocular
      heart, their lungs, their movable eyelids, their hollow ears, penem
      intrantem feminam mammis lactantem,” and finally, “ex lege naturæ jure
      meritoque.” I submitted all this to my friends Simeon Macey and Charley
      Coffin, of Nantucket, both messmates of mine in a certain voyage, and
      they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether
      insufficient. Charley profanely hinted they were humbug.
      
      Be it known that, waiving all argument, I take the good old fashioned
      ground that the whale is a fish, and call upon holy Jonah to back me.
      This fundamental thing settled, the next point is, in what internal
      respect does the whale differ from other fish. Above, Linnæus has given
      you those items. But in brief, they are these: lungs and warm blood;
      whereas, all other fish are lungless and cold blooded.
      
      Next: how shall we define the whale, by his obvious externals, so as
      conspicuously to label him for all time to come? To be short, then, a
      whale is _a spouting fish with a horizontal tail_. There you have him.
      However contracted, that definition is the result of expanded
      meditation. A walrus spouts much like a whale, but the walrus is not a
      fish, because he is amphibious. But the last term of the definition is
      still more cogent, as coupled with the first. Almost any one must have
      noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat, but a
      vertical, or up-and-down tail. Whereas, among spouting fish the tail,
      though it may be similarly shaped, invariably assumes a horizontal
      position.
      
      By the above definition of what a whale is, I do by no means exclude
      from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified
      with the whale by the best informed Nantucketers; nor, on the other
      hand, link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as
      alien.* Hence, all the smaller, spouting, and horizontal tailed fish
      must be included in this ground-plan of Cetology. Now, then, come the
      grand divisions of the entire whale host.
      
      *I am aware that down to the present time, the fish styled Lamatins and
      Dugongs (Pig-fish and Sow-fish of the Coffins of Nantucket) are
      included by many naturalists among the whales. But as these pig-fish
      are a noisy, contemptible set, mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers,
      and feeding on wet hay, and especially as they do not spout, I deny
      their credentials as whales; and have presented them with their
      passports to quit the Kingdom of Cetology.
      
      First: According to magnitude I divide the whales into three primary
      BOOKS (subdivisible into CHAPTERS), and these shall comprehend them
      all, both small and large.
      
      I. THE FOLIO WHALE; II. the OCTAVO WHALE; III. the DUODECIMO WHALE.
      
      As the type of the FOLIO I present the _Sperm Whale_; of the OCTAVO,
      the _Grampus_; of the DUODECIMO, the _Porpoise_.
      
      FOLIOS. Among these I here include the following chapters:—I. The
      _Sperm Whale_; II. the _Right Whale_; III. the _Fin-Back Whale_; IV.
      the _Hump-backed Whale_; V. the _Razor Back Whale_; VI. the _Sulphur
      Bottom Whale_.
      
      BOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER I. (_Sperm Whale_).—This whale, among the
      English of old vaguely known as the Trumpa whale, and the Physeter
      whale, and the Anvil Headed whale, is the present Cachalot of the
      French, and the Pottsfich of the Germans, and the Macrocephalus of the
      Long Words. He is, without doubt, the largest inhabitant of the globe;
      the most formidable of all whales to encounter; the most majestic in
      aspect; and lastly, by far the most valuable in commerce; he being the
      only creature from which that valuable substance, spermaceti, is
      obtained. All his peculiarities will, in many other places, be enlarged
      upon. It is chiefly with his name that I now have to do. Philologically
      considered, it is absurd. Some centuries ago, when the Sperm whale was
      almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality, and when his oil
      was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish; in those days
      spermaceti, it would seem, was popularly supposed to be derived from a
      creature identical with the one then known in England as the Greenland
      or Right Whale. It was the idea also, that this same spermaceti was
      that quickening humor of the Greenland Whale which the first syllable
      of the word literally expresses. In those times, also, spermaceti was
      exceedingly scarce, not being used for light, but only as an ointment
      and medicament. It was only to be had from the druggists as you
      nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb. When, as I opine, in the course of
      time, the true nature of spermaceti became known, its original name was
      still retained by the dealers; no doubt to enhance its value by a
      notion so strangely significant of its scarcity. And so the appellation
      must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this
      spermaceti was really derived.
      
      BOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER II. (_Right Whale_).—In one respect this is
      the most venerable of the leviathans, being the one first regularly
      hunted by man. It yields the article commonly known as whalebone or
      baleen; and the oil specially known as “whale oil,” an inferior article
      in commerce. Among the fishermen, he is indiscriminately designated by
      all the following titles: The Whale; the Greenland Whale; the Black
      Whale; the Great Whale; the True Whale; the Right Whale. There is a
      deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus
      multitudinously baptised. What then is the whale, which I include in
      the second species of my Folios? It is the Great Mysticetus of the
      English naturalists; the Greenland Whale of the English whalemen; the
      Baleine Ordinaire of the French whalemen; the Growlands Walfish of the
      Swedes. It is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been
      hunted by the Dutch and English in the Arctic seas; it is the whale
      which the American fishermen have long pursued in the Indian ocean, on
      the Brazil Banks, on the Nor’ West Coast, and various other parts of
      the world, designated by them Right Whale Cruising Grounds.
      
      Some pretend to see a difference between the Greenland whale of the
      English and the right whale of the Americans. But they precisely agree
      in all their grand features; nor has there yet been presented a single
      determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction. It is by
      endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences, that
      some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate.
      The right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length, with
      reference to elucidating the sperm whale.
      
      BOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER III. (_Fin-Back_).—Under this head I reckon
      a monster which, by the various names of Fin-Back, Tall-Spout, and
      Long-John, has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale
      whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the
      Atlantic, in the New York packet-tracks. In the length he attains, and
      in his baleen, the Fin-back resembles the right whale, but is of a less
      portly girth, and a lighter colour, approaching to olive. His great
      lips present a cable-like aspect, formed by the intertwisting, slanting
      folds of large wrinkles. His grand distinguishing feature, the fin,
      from which he derives his name, is often a conspicuous object. This fin
      is some three or four feet long, growing vertically from the hinder
      part of the back, of an angular shape, and with a very sharp pointed
      end. Even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible,
      this isolated fin will, at times, be seen plainly projecting from the
      surface. When the sea is moderately calm, and slightly marked with
      spherical ripples, and this gnomon-like fin stands up and casts shadows
      upon the wrinkled surface, it may well be supposed that the watery
      circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial, with its style and
      wavy hour-lines graved on it. On that Ahaz-dial the shadow often goes
      back. The Fin-Back is not gregarious. He seems a whale-hater, as some
      men are man-haters. Very shy; always going solitary; unexpectedly
      rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters; his
      straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear
      upon a barren plain; gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in
      swimming, as to defy all present pursuit from man; this leviathan seems
      the banished and unconquerable Cain of his race, bearing for his mark
      that style upon his back. From having the baleen in his mouth, the
      Fin-Back is sometimes included with the right whale, among a theoretic
      species denominated _Whalebone whales_, that is, whales with baleen. Of
      these so called Whalebone whales, there would seem to be several
      varieties, most of which, however, are little known. Broad-nosed whales
      and beaked whales; pike-headed whales; bunched whales; under-jawed
      whales and rostrated whales, are the fishermen’s names for a few sorts.
      
      In connection with this appellative of “Whalebone whales,” it is of
      great importance to mention, that however such a nomenclature may be
      convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales, yet it is
      in vain to attempt a clear classification of the Leviathan, founded
      upon either his baleen, or hump, or fin, or teeth; notwithstanding that
      those marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to
      afford the basis for a regular system of Cetology than any other
      detached bodily distinctions, which the whale, in his kinds, presents.
      How then? The baleen, hump, back-fin, and teeth; these are things whose
      peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales,
      without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in
      other and more essential particulars. Thus, the sperm whale and the
      humpbacked whale, each has a hump; but there the similitude ceases.
      Then, this same humpbacked whale and the Greenland whale, each of these
      has baleen; but there again the similitude ceases. And it is just the
      same with the other parts above mentioned. In various sorts of whales,
      they form such irregular combinations; or, in the case of any one of
      them detached, such an irregular isolation; as utterly to defy all
      general methodization formed upon such a basis. On this rock every one
      of the whale-naturalists has split.
      
      But it may possibly be conceived that, in the internal parts of the
      whale, in his anatomy—there, at least, we shall be able to hit the
      right classification. Nay; what thing, for example, is there in the
      Greenland whale’s anatomy more striking than his baleen? Yet we have
      seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the
      Greenland whale. And if you descend into the bowels of the various
      leviathans, why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as
      available to the systematizer as those external ones already
      enumerated. What then remains? nothing but to take hold of the whales
      bodily, in their entire liberal volume, and boldly sort them that way.
      And this is the Bibliographical system here adopted; and it is the only
      one that can possibly succeed, for it alone is practicable. To proceed.
      
      BOOK I. (_Folio_) CHAPTER IV. (_Hump Back_).—This whale is often seen
      on the northern American coast. He has been frequently captured there,
      and towed into harbor. He has a great pack on him like a peddler; or
      you might call him the Elephant and Castle whale. At any rate, the
      popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him, since the
      sperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one. His oil is not very
      valuable. He has baleen. He is the most gamesome and light-hearted of
      all the whales, making more gay foam and white water generally than any
      other of them.
      
      BOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER V. (_Razor Back_).—Of this whale little is
      known but his name. I have seen him at a distance off Cape Horn. Of a
      retiring nature, he eludes both hunters and philosophers. Though no
      coward, he has never yet shown any part of him but his back, which
      rises in a long sharp ridge. Let him go. I know little more of him, nor
      does anybody else.
      
      BOOK I. (_Folio_), CHAPTER VI. (_Sulphur Bottom_).—Another retiring
      gentleman, with a brimstone belly, doubtless got by scraping along the
      Tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings. He is seldom seen;
      at least I have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas, and
      then always at too great a distance to study his countenance. He is
      never chased; he would run away with rope-walks of line. Prodigies are
      told of him. Adieu, Sulphur Bottom! I can say nothing more that is true
      of ye, nor can the oldest Nantucketer.
      
      Thus ends BOOK I. (_Folio_), and now begins BOOK II. (_Octavo_).
      
      OCTAVOES.*—These embrace the whales of middling magnitude, among which
      present may be numbered:—I., the _Grampus_; II., the _Black Fish_;
      III., the _Narwhale_; IV., the _Thrasher_; V., the _Killer_.
      
      *Why this book of whales is not denominated the Quarto is very plain.
      Because, while the whales of this order, though smaller than those of
      the former order, nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them
      in figure, yet the bookbinder’s Quarto volume in its dimensioned form
      does not preserve the shape of the Folio volume, but the Octavo volume
      does.
      
      BOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER I. (_Grampus_).—Though this fish, whose
      loud sonorous breathing, or rather blowing, has furnished a proverb to
      landsmen, is so well known a denizen of the deep, yet is he not
      popularly classed among whales. But possessing all the grand
      distinctive features of the leviathan, most naturalists have recognised
      him for one. He is of moderate octavo size, varying from fifteen to
      twenty-five feet in length, and of corresponding dimensions round the
      waist. He swims in herds; he is never regularly hunted, though his oil
      is considerable in quantity, and pretty good for light. By some
      fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the
      great sperm whale.
      
      BOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER II. (_Black Fish_).—I give the popular
      fishermen’s names for all these fish, for generally they are the best.
      Where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive, I shall say so, and
      suggest another. I do so now, touching the Black Fish, so-called,
      because blackness is the rule among almost all whales. So, call him the
      Hyena Whale, if you please. His voracity is well known, and from the
      circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards, he
      carries an everlasting Mephistophelean grin on his face. This whale
      averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length. He is found in almost
      all latitudes. He has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin
      in swimming, which looks something like a Roman nose. When not more
      profitably employed, the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the
      Hyena whale, to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic
      employment—as some frugal housekeepers, in the absence of company, and
      quite alone by themselves, burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax.
      Though their blubber is very thin, some of these whales will yield you
      upwards of thirty gallons of oil.
      
      BOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER III. (_Narwhale_), that is, _Nostril
      whale_.—Another instance of a curiously named whale, so named I suppose
      from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose. The
      creature is some sixteen feet in length, while its horn averages five
      feet, though some exceed ten, and even attain to fifteen feet. Strictly
      speaking, this horn is but a lengthened tusk, growing out from the jaw
      in a line a little depressed from the horizontal. But it is only found
      on the sinister side, which has an ill effect, giving its owner
      something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy left-handed man. What
      precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers, it would be hard to
      say. It does not seem to be used like the blade of the sword-fish and
      bill-fish; though some sailors tell me that the Narwhale employs it for
      a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food. Charley Coffin
      said it was used for an ice-piercer; for the Narwhale, rising to the
      surface of the Polar Sea, and finding it sheeted with ice, thrusts his
      horn up, and so breaks through. But you cannot prove either of these
      surmises to be correct. My own opinion is, that however this one-sided
      horn may really be used by the Narwhale—however that may be—it would
      certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets.
      The Narwhale I have heard called the Tusked whale, the Horned whale,
      and the Unicorn whale. He is certainly a curious example of the
      Unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature. From
      certain cloistered old authors I have gathered that this same
      sea-unicorn’s horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote
      against poison, and as such, preparations of it brought immense prices.
      It was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies, the same
      way that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn.
      Originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity.
      Black Letter tells me that Sir Martin Frobisher on his return from that
      voyage, when Queen Bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him
      from a window of Greenwich Palace, as his bold ship sailed down the
      Thames; “when Sir Martin returned from that voyage,” saith Black
      Letter, “on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long
      horn of the Narwhale, which for a long period after hung in the castle
      at Windsor.” An Irish author avers that the Earl of Leicester, on
      bended knees, did likewise present to her highness another horn,
      pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature.
      
      The Narwhale has a very picturesque, leopard-like look, being of a
      milk-white ground colour, dotted with round and oblong spots of black.
      His oil is very superior, clear and fine; but there is little of it,
      and he is seldom hunted. He is mostly found in the circumpolar seas.
      
      BOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER IV. (_Killer_).—Of this whale little is
      precisely known to the Nantucketer, and nothing at all to the professed
      naturalist. From what I have seen of him at a distance, I should say
      that he was about the bigness of a grampus. He is very savage—a sort of
      Feegee fish. He sometimes takes the great Folio whales by the lip, and
      hangs there like a leech, till the mighty brute is worried to death.
      The Killer is never hunted. I never heard what sort of oil he has.
      Exception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale, on the
      ground of its indistinctness. For we are all killers, on land and on
      sea; Bonapartes and Sharks included.
      
      BOOK II. (_Octavo_), CHAPTER V. (_Thrasher_).—This gentleman is famous
      for his tail, which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes. He
      mounts the Folio whale’s back, and as he swims, he works his passage by
      flogging him; as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar
      process. Still less is known of the Thrasher than of the Killer. Both
      are outlaws, even in the lawless seas.
      
       Thus ends BOOK II. (_Octavo_), and begins BOOK III. (_Duodecimo_).
      
      DUODECIMOES.—These include the smaller whales. I. The Huzza Porpoise.
      II. The Algerine Porpoise. III. The Mealy-mouthed Porpoise.
      
      To those who have not chanced specially to study the subject, it may
      possibly seem strange, that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five
      feet should be marshalled among WHALES—a word, which, in the popular
      sense, always conveys an idea of hugeness. But the creatures set down
      above as Duodecimoes are infallibly whales, by the terms of my
      definition of what a whale is—_i.e._ a spouting fish, with a horizontal
      tail.
      
      BOOK III. (_Duodecimo_), CHAPTER 1. (_Huzza Porpoise_).—This is the
      common porpoise found almost all over the globe. The name is of my own
      bestowal; for there are more than one sort of porpoises, and something
      must be done to distinguish them. I call him thus, because he always
      swims in hilarious shoals, which upon the broad sea keep tossing
      themselves to heaven like caps in a Fourth-of-July crowd. Their
      appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner. Full of
      fine spirits, they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward.
      They are the lads that always live before the wind. They are accounted
      a lucky omen. If you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding
      these vivacious fish, then heaven help ye; the spirit of godly
      gamesomeness is not in ye. A well-fed, plump Huzza Porpoise will yield
      you one good gallon of good oil. But the fine and delicate fluid
      extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable. It is in request among
      jewellers and watchmakers. Sailors put it on their hones. Porpoise meat
      is good eating, you know. It may never have occurred to you that a
      porpoise spouts. Indeed, his spout is so small that it is not very
      readily discernible. But the next time you have a chance, watch him;
      and you will then see the great Sperm whale himself in miniature.
      
      BOOK III. (_Duodecimo_), CHAPTER II. (_Algerine Porpoise_).—A pirate.
      Very savage. He is only found, I think, in the Pacific. He is somewhat
      larger than the Huzza Porpoise, but much of the same general make.
      Provoke him, and he will buckle to a shark. I have lowered for him many
      times, but never yet saw him captured.
      
      BOOK III. (_Duodecimo_), CHAPTER III. (_Mealy-mouthed Porpoise_).—The
      largest kind of Porpoise; and only found in the Pacific, so far as it
      is known. The only English name, by which he has hitherto been
      designated, is that of the fishers—Right-Whale Porpoise, from the
      circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that Folio. In
      shape, he differs in some degree from the Huzza Porpoise, being of a
      less rotund and jolly girth; indeed, he is of quite a neat and
      gentleman-like figure. He has no fins on his back (most other porpoises
      have), he has a lovely tail, and sentimental Indian eyes of a hazel
      hue. But his mealy-mouth spoils all. Though his entire back down to his
      side fins is of a deep sable, yet a boundary line, distinct as the mark
      in a ship’s hull, called the “bright waist,” that line streaks him from
      stem to stern, with two separate colours, black above and white below.
      The white comprises part of his head, and the whole of his mouth, which
      makes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a
      meal-bag. A most mean and mealy aspect! His oil is much like that of
      the common porpoise.
      
        * * * * * *
      
      Beyond the DUODECIMO, this system does not proceed, inasmuch as the
      Porpoise is the smallest of the whales. Above, you have all the
      Leviathans of note. But there are a rabble of uncertain, fugitive,
      half-fabulous whales, which, as an American whaleman, I know by
      reputation, but not personally. I shall enumerate them by their
      fore-castle appellations; for possibly such a list may be valuable to
      future investigators, who may complete what I have here but begun. If
      any of the following whales, shall hereafter be caught and marked, then
      he can readily be incorporated into this System, according to his
      Folio, Octavo, or Duodecimo magnitude:—The Bottle-Nose Whale; the Junk
      Whale; the Pudding-Headed Whale; the Cape Whale; the Leading Whale; the
      Cannon Whale; the Scragg Whale; the Coppered Whale; the Elephant Whale;
      the Iceberg Whale; the Quog Whale; the Blue Whale; etc. From Icelandic,
      Dutch, and old English authorities, there might be quoted other lists
      of uncertain whales, blessed with all manner of uncouth names. But I
      omit them as altogether obsolete; and can hardly help suspecting them
      for mere sounds, full of Leviathanism, but signifying nothing.
      
      Finally: It was stated at the outset, that this system would not be
      here, and at once, perfected. You cannot but plainly see that I have
      kept my word. But I now leave my cetological System standing thus
      unfinished, even as the great Cathedral of Cologne was left, with the
      crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower. For small
      erections may be finished by their first architects; grand ones, true
      ones, ever leave the copestone to posterity. God keep me from ever
      completing anything. This whole book is but a draught—nay, but the
      draught of a draught. Oh, Time, Strength, Cash, and Patience!
      
      
      CHAPTER 33. The Specksnyder.
      
      Concerning the officers of the whale-craft, this seems as good a place
      as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on ship-board, arising
      from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers, a class unknown
      of course in any other marine than the whale-fleet.
      
      The large importance attached to the harpooneer’s vocation is evinced
      by the fact, that originally in the old Dutch Fishery, two centuries
      and more ago, the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the
      person now called the captain, but was divided between him and an
      officer called the Specksnyder. Literally this word means Fat-Cutter;
      usage, however, in time made it equivalent to Chief Harpooneer. In
      those days, the captain’s authority was restricted to the navigation
      and general management of the vessel; while over the whale-hunting
      department and all its concerns, the Specksnyder or Chief Harpooneer
      reigned supreme. In the British Greenland Fishery, under the corrupted
      title of Specksioneer, this old Dutch official is still retained, but
      his former dignity is sadly abridged. At present he ranks simply as
      senior Harpooneer; and as such, is but one of the captain’s more
      inferior subalterns. Nevertheless, as upon the good conduct of the
      harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends, and since
      in the American Fishery he is not only an important officer in the
      boat, but under certain circumstances (night watches on a whaling
      ground) the command of the ship’s deck is also his; therefore the grand
      political maxim of the sea demands, that he should nominally live apart
      from the men before the mast, and be in some way distinguished as their
      professional superior; though always, by them, familiarly regarded as
      their social equal.
      
      Now, the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea, is
      this—the first lives aft, the last forward. Hence, in whale-ships and
      merchantmen alike, the mates have their quarters with the captain; and
      so, too, in most of the American whalers the harpooneers are lodged in
      the after part of the ship. That is to say, they take their meals in
      the captain’s cabin, and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with
      it.
      
      Though the long period of a Southern whaling voyage (by far the longest
      of all voyages now or ever made by man), the peculiar perils of it, and
      the community of interest prevailing among a company, all of whom, high
      or low, depend for their profits, not upon fixed wages, but upon their
      common luck, together with their common vigilance, intrepidity, and
      hard work; though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a
      less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally; yet, never mind
      how much like an old Mesopotamian family these whalemen may, in some
      primitive instances, live together; for all that, the punctilious
      externals, at least, of the quarter-deck are seldom materially relaxed,
      and in no instance done away. Indeed, many are the Nantucket ships in
      which you will see the skipper parading his quarter-deck with an elated
      grandeur not surpassed in any military navy; nay, extorting almost as
      much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple, and not the
      shabbiest of pilot-cloth.
      
      And though of all men the moody captain of the Pequod was the least
      given to that sort of shallowest assumption; and though the only homage
      he ever exacted, was implicit, instantaneous obedience; though he
      required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the
      quarter-deck; and though there were times when, owing to peculiar
      circumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed, he
      addressed them in unusual terms, whether of condescension or _in
      terrorem_, or otherwise; yet even Captain Ahab was by no means
      unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea.
      
      Nor, perhaps, will it fail to be eventually perceived, that behind
      those forms and usages, as it were, he sometimes masked himself;
      incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than
      they were legitimately intended to subserve. That certain sultanism of
      his brain, which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested;
      through those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an
      irresistible dictatorship. For be a man’s intellectual superiority what
      it will, it can never assume the practical, available supremacy over
      other men, without the aid of some sort of external arts and
      entrenchments, always, in themselves, more or less paltry and base.
      This it is, that for ever keeps God’s true princes of the Empire from
      the world’s hustings; and leaves the highest honors that this air can
      give, to those men who become famous more through their infinite
      inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the Divine Inert, than
      through their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass.
      Such large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political
      superstitions invest them, that in some royal instances even to idiot
      imbecility they have imparted potency. But when, as in the case of
      Nicholas the Czar, the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an
      imperial brain; then, the plebeian herds crouch abased before the
      tremendous centralization. Nor, will the tragic dramatist who would
      depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing,
      ever forget a hint, incidentally so important in his art, as the one
      now alluded to.
      
      But Ahab, my Captain, still moves before me in all his Nantucket
      grimness and shagginess; and in this episode touching Emperors and
      Kings, I must not conceal that I have only to do with a poor old
      whale-hunter like him; and, therefore, all outward majestical trappings
      and housings are denied me. Oh, Ahab! what shall be grand in thee, it
      must needs be plucked at from the skies, and dived for in the deep, and
      featured in the unbodied air!
      
      
      CHAPTER 34. The Cabin-Table.
      
      It is noon; and Dough-Boy, the steward, thrusting his pale
      loaf-of-bread face from the cabin-scuttle, announces dinner to his lord
      and master; who, sitting in the lee quarter-boat, has just been taking
      an observation of the sun; and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on
      the smooth, medallion-shaped tablet, reserved for that daily purpose on
      the upper part of his ivory leg. From his complete inattention to the
      tidings, you would think that moody Ahab had not heard his menial. But
      presently, catching hold of the mizen shrouds, he swings himself to the
      deck, and in an even, unexhilarated voice, saying, “Dinner, Mr.
      Starbuck,” disappears into the cabin.
      
      When the last echo of his sultan’s step has died away, and Starbuck,
      the first Emir, has every reason to suppose that he is seated, then
      Starbuck rouses from his quietude, takes a few turns along the planks,
      and, after a grave peep into the binnacle, says, with some touch of
      pleasantness, “Dinner, Mr. Stubb,” and descends the scuttle. The second
      Emir lounges about the rigging awhile, and then slightly shaking the
      main brace, to see whether it will be all right with that important
      rope, he likewise takes up the old burden, and with a rapid “Dinner,
      Mr. Flask,” follows after his predecessors.
      
      But the third Emir, now seeing himself all alone on the quarter-deck,
      seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint; for, tipping all
      sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions, and kicking off his
      shoes, he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right
      over the Grand Turk’s head; and then, by a dexterous sleight, pitching
      his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf, he goes down rollicking so
      far at least as he remains visible from the deck, reversing all other
      processions, by bringing up the rear with music. But ere stepping into
      the cabin doorway below, he pauses, ships a new face altogether, and,
      then, independent, hilarious little Flask enters King Ahab’s presence,
      in the character of Abjectus, or the Slave.
      
      It is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense
      artificialness of sea-usages, that while in the open air of the deck
      some officers will, upon provocation, bear themselves boldly and
      defyingly enough towards their commander; yet, ten to one, let those
      very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that
      same commander’s cabin, and straightway their inoffensive, not to say
      deprecatory and humble air towards him, as he sits at the head of the
      table; this is marvellous, sometimes most comical. Wherefore this
      difference? A problem? Perhaps not. To have been Belshazzar, King of
      Babylon; and to have been Belshazzar, not haughtily but courteously,
      therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur. But he
      who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own
      private dinner-table of invited guests, that man’s unchallenged power
      and dominion of individual influence for the time; that man’s royalty
      of state transcends Belshazzar’s, for Belshazzar was not the greatest.
      Who has but once dined his friends, has tasted what it is to be Cæsar.
      It is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding.
      Now, if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a
      ship-master, then, by inference, you will derive the cause of that
      peculiarity of sea-life just mentioned.
      
      Over his ivory-inlaid table, Ahab presided like a mute, maned sea-lion
      on the white coral beach, surrounded by his warlike but still
      deferential cubs. In his own proper turn, each officer waited to be
      served. They were as little children before Ahab; and yet, in Ahab,
      there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance. With one mind,
      their intent eyes all fastened upon the old man’s knife, as he carved
      the chief dish before him. I do not suppose that for the world they
      would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation, even
      upon so neutral a topic as the weather. No! And when reaching out his
      knife and fork, between which the slice of beef was locked, Ahab
      thereby motioned Starbuck’s plate towards him, the mate received his
      meat as though receiving alms; and cut it tenderly; and a little
      started if, perchance, the knife grazed against the plate; and chewed
      it noiselessly; and swallowed it, not without circumspection. For, like
      the Coronation banquet at Frankfort, where the German Emperor
      profoundly dines with the seven Imperial Electors, so these cabin meals
      were somehow solemn meals, eaten in awful silence; and yet at table old
      Ahab forbade not conversation; only he himself was dumb. What a relief
      it was to choking Stubb, when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold
      below. And poor little Flask, he was the youngest son, and little boy
      of this weary family party. His were the shinbones of the saline beef;
      his would have been the drumsticks. For Flask to have presumed to help
      himself, this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the
      first degree. Had he helped himself at that table, doubtless, never
      more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world;
      nevertheless, strange to say, Ahab never forbade him. And had Flask
      helped himself, the chances were Ahab had never so much as noticed it.
      Least of all, did Flask presume to help himself to butter. Whether he
      thought the owners of the ship denied it to him, on account of its
      clotting his clear, sunny complexion; or whether he deemed that, on so
      long a voyage in such marketless waters, butter was at a premium, and
      therefore was not for him, a subaltern; however it was, Flask, alas!
      was a butterless man!
      
      Another thing. Flask was the last person down at the dinner, and Flask
      is the first man up. Consider! For hereby Flask’s dinner was badly
      jammed in point of time. Starbuck and Stubb both had the start of him;
      and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear. If Stubb
      even, who is but a peg higher than Flask, happens to have but a small
      appetite, and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast, then Flask
      must bestir himself, he will not get more than three mouthfuls that
      day; for it is against holy usage for Stubb to precede Flask to the
      deck. Therefore it was that Flask once admitted in private, that ever
      since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer, from that moment he
      had never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry, more or less.
      For what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger, as keep it immortal
      in him. Peace and satisfaction, thought Flask, have for ever departed
      from my stomach. I am an officer; but, how I wish I could fish a bit of
      old-fashioned beef in the forecastle, as I used to when I was before
      the mast. There’s the fruits of promotion now; there’s the vanity of
      glory: there’s the insanity of life! Besides, if it were so that any
      mere sailor of the Pequod had a grudge against Flask in Flask’s
      official capacity, all that sailor had to do, in order to obtain ample
      vengeance, was to go aft at dinner-time, and get a peep at Flask
      through the cabin sky-light, sitting silly and dumfoundered before
      awful Ahab.
      
      Now, Ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table
      in the Pequod’s cabin. After their departure, taking place in inverted
      order to their arrival, the canvas cloth was cleared, or rather was
      restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward. And then the
      three harpooneers were bidden to the feast, they being its residuary
      legatees. They made a sort of temporary servants’ hall of the high and
      mighty cabin.
      
      In strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless
      invisible domineerings of the captain’s table, was the entire care-free
      license and ease, the almost frantic democracy of those inferior
      fellows the harpooneers. While their masters, the mates, seemed afraid
      of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws, the harpooneers chewed
      their food with such a relish that there was a report to it. They dined
      like lords; they filled their bellies like Indian ships all day loading
      with spices. Such portentous appetites had Queequeg and Tashtego, that
      to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast, often the pale
      Dough-Boy was fain to bring on a great baron of salt-junk, seemingly
      quarried out of the solid ox. And if he were not lively about it, if he
      did not go with a nimble hop-skip-and-jump, then Tashtego had an
      ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back,
      harpoon-wise. And once Daggoo, seized with a sudden humor, assisted
      Dough-Boy’s memory by snatching him up bodily, and thrusting his head
      into a great empty wooden trencher, while Tashtego, knife in hand,
      began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him. He was
      naturally a very nervous, shuddering sort of little fellow, this
      bread-faced steward; the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital
      nurse. And what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific Ahab,
      and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages,
      Dough-Boy’s whole life was one continual lip-quiver. Commonly, after
      seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded, he
      would escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining, and
      fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door, till all was
      over.
      
      It was a sight to see Queequeg seated over against Tashtego, opposing
      his filed teeth to the Indian’s: crosswise to them, Daggoo seated on
      the floor, for a bench would have brought his hearse-plumed head to the
      low carlines; at every motion of his colossal limbs, making the low
      cabin framework to shake, as when an African elephant goes passenger in
      a ship. But for all this, the great negro was wonderfully abstemious,
      not to say dainty. It seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively
      small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so
      broad, baronial, and superb a person. But, doubtless, this noble savage
      fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air; and through
      his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds. Not by
      beef or by bread, are giants made or nourished. But Queequeg, he had a
      mortal, barbaric smack of the lip in eating—an ugly sound enough—so
      much so, that the trembling Dough-Boy almost looked to see whether any
      marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms. And when he would hear
      Tashtego singing out for him to produce himself, that his bones might
      be picked, the simple-witted steward all but shattered the crockery
      hanging round him in the pantry, by his sudden fits of the palsy. Nor
      did the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets, for
      their lances and other weapons; and with which whetstones, at dinner,
      they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives; that grating sound did
      not at all tend to tranquillize poor Dough-Boy. How could he forget
      that in his Island days, Queequeg, for one, must certainly have been
      guilty of some murderous, convivial indiscretions. Alas! Dough-Boy!
      hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals. Not a napkin
      should he carry on his arm, but a buckler. In good time, though, to his
      great delight, the three salt-sea warriors would rise and depart; to
      his credulous, fable-mongering ears, all their martial bones jingling
      in them at every step, like Moorish scimetars in scabbards.
      
      But, though these barbarians dined in the cabin, and nominally lived
      there; still, being anything but sedentary in their habits, they were
      scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes, and just before sleeping-time,
      when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters.
      
      In this one matter, Ahab seemed no exception to most American whale
      captains, who, as a set, rather incline to the opinion that by rights
      the ship’s cabin belongs to them; and that it is by courtesy alone that
      anybody else is, at any time, permitted there. So that, in real truth,
      the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to
      have lived out of the cabin than in it. For when they did enter it, it
      was something as a street-door enters a house; turning inwards for a
      moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a permanent thing,
      residing in the open air. Nor did they lose much hereby; in the cabin
      was no companionship; socially, Ahab was inaccessible. Though nominally
      included in the census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it. He
      lived in the world, as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled
      Missouri. And as when Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan
      of the woods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the
      winter there, sucking his own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old
      age, Ahab’s soul, shut up in the caved trunk of his body, there fed
      upon the sullen paws of its gloom!
      
      
      CHAPTER 35. The Mast-Head.
      
      It was during the more pleasant weather, that in due rotation with the
      other seamen my first mast-head came round.
      
      In most American whalemen the mast-heads are manned almost
      simultaneously with the vessel’s leaving her port; even though she may
      have fifteen thousand miles, and more, to sail ere reaching her proper
      cruising ground. And if, after a three, four, or five years’ voyage she
      is drawing nigh home with anything empty in her—say, an empty vial
      even—then, her mast-heads are kept manned to the last; and not till her
      skysail-poles sail in among the spires of the port, does she altogether
      relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more.
      
      Now, as the business of standing mast-heads, ashore or afloat, is a
      very ancient and interesting one, let us in some measure expatiate
      here. I take it, that the earliest standers of mast-heads were the old
      Egyptians; because, in all my researches, I find none prior to them.
      For though their progenitors, the builders of Babel, must doubtless, by
      their tower, have intended to rear the loftiest mast-head in all Asia,
      or Africa either; yet (ere the final truck was put to it) as that great
      stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board, in the
      dread gale of God’s wrath; therefore, we cannot give these Babel
      builders priority over the Egyptians. And that the Egyptians were a
      nation of mast-head standers, is an assertion based upon the general
      belief among archæologists, that the first pyramids were founded for
      astronomical purposes: a theory singularly supported by the peculiar
      stair-like formation of all four sides of those edifices; whereby, with
      prodigious long upliftings of their legs, those old astronomers were
      wont to mount to the apex, and sing out for new stars; even as the
      look-outs of a modern ship sing out for a sail, or a whale just bearing
      in sight. In Saint Stylites, the famous Christian hermit of old times,
      who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole
      latter portion of his life on its summit, hoisting his food from the
      ground with a tackle; in him we have a remarkable instance of a
      dauntless stander-of-mast-heads; who was not to be driven from his
      place by fogs or frosts, rain, hail, or sleet; but valiantly facing
      everything out to the last, literally died at his post. Of modern
      standers-of-mast-heads we have but a lifeless set; mere stone, iron,
      and bronze men; who, though well capable of facing out a stiff gale,
      are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon
      discovering any strange sight. There is Napoleon; who, upon the top of
      the column of Vendome, stands with arms folded, some one hundred and
      fifty feet in the air; careless, now, who rules the decks below;
      whether Louis Philippe, Louis Blanc, or Louis the Devil. Great
      Washington, too, stands high aloft on his towering main-mast in
      Baltimore, and like one of Hercules’ pillars, his column marks that
      point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go. Admiral
      Nelson, also, on a capstan of gun-metal, stands his mast-head in
      Trafalgar Square; and ever when most obscured by that London smoke,
      token is yet given that a hidden hero is there; for where there is
      smoke, must be fire. But neither great Washington, nor Napoleon, nor
      Nelson, will answer a single hail from below, however madly invoked to
      befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze;
      however it may be surmised, that their spirits penetrate through the
      thick haze of the future, and descry what shoals and what rocks must be
      shunned.
      
      It may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the mast-head
      standers of the land with those of the sea; but that in truth it is not
      so, is plainly evinced by an item for which Obed Macy, the sole
      historian of Nantucket, stands accountable. The worthy Obed tells us,
      that in the early times of the whale fishery, ere ships were regularly
      launched in pursuit of the game, the people of that island erected
      lofty spars along the sea-coast, to which the look-outs ascended by
      means of nailed cleats, something as fowls go upstairs in a hen-house.
      A few years ago this same plan was adopted by the Bay whalemen of New
      Zealand, who, upon descrying the game, gave notice to the ready-manned
      boats nigh the beach. But this custom has now become obsolete; turn we
      then to the one proper mast-head, that of a whale-ship at sea. The
      three mast-heads are kept manned from sun-rise to sun-set; the seamen
      taking their regular turns (as at the helm), and relieving each other
      every two hours. In the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly
      pleasant the mast-head; nay, to a dreamy meditative man it is
      delightful. There you stand, a hundred feet above the silent decks,
      striding along the deep, as if the masts were gigantic stilts, while
      beneath you and between your legs, as it were, swim the hugest monsters
      of the sea, even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous
      Colossus at old Rhodes. There you stand, lost in the infinite series of
      the sea, with nothing ruffled but the waves. The tranced ship
      indolently rolls; the drowsy trade winds blow; everything resolves you
      into languor. For the most part, in this tropic whaling life, a sublime
      uneventfulness invests you; you hear no news; read no gazettes; extras
      with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into
      unnecessary excitements; you hear of no domestic afflictions; bankrupt
      securities; fall of stocks; are never troubled with the thought of what
      you shall have for dinner—for all your meals for three years and more
      are snugly stowed in casks, and your bill of fare is immutable.
      
      In one of those southern whalesmen, on a long three or four years’
      voyage, as often happens, the sum of the various hours you spend at the
      mast-head would amount to several entire months. And it is much to be
      deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion
      of the whole term of your natural life, should be so sadly destitute of
      anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness, or adapted to breed a
      comfortable localness of feeling, such as pertains to a bed, a hammock,
      a hearse, a sentry box, a pulpit, a coach, or any other of those small
      and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves. Your
      most usual point of perch is the head of the t’ gallant-mast, where you
      stand upon two thin parallel sticks (almost peculiar to whalemen)
      called the t’ gallant cross-trees. Here, tossed about by the sea, the
      beginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bull’s horns. To
      be sure, in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you, in
      the shape of a watch-coat; but properly speaking the thickest
      watch-coat is no more of a house than the unclad body; for as the soul
      is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle, and cannot freely move about
      in it, nor even move out of it, without running great risk of perishing
      (like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy Alps in winter); so a
      watch-coat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope, or
      additional skin encasing you. You cannot put a shelf or chest of
      drawers in your body, and no more can you make a convenient closet of
      your watch-coat.
      
      Concerning all this, it is much to be deplored that the mast-heads of a
      southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or
      pulpits, called _crow’s-nests_, in which the look-outs of a Greenland
      whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas. In
      the fireside narrative of Captain Sleet, entitled “A Voyage among the
      Icebergs, in quest of the Greenland Whale, and incidentally for the
      re-discovery of the Lost Icelandic Colonies of Old Greenland;” in this
      admirable volume, all standers of mast-heads are furnished with a
      charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented
      _crow’s-nest_ of the Glacier, which was the name of Captain Sleet’s
      good craft. He called it the _Sleet’s crow’s-nest_, in honor of
      himself; he being the original inventor and patentee, and free from all
      ridiculous false delicacy, and holding that if we call our own children
      after our own names (we fathers being the original inventors and
      patentees), so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other
      apparatus we may beget. In shape, the Sleet’s crow’s-nest is something
      like a large tierce or pipe; it is open above, however, where it is
      furnished with a movable side-screen to keep to windward of your head
      in a hard gale. Being fixed on the summit of the mast, you ascend into
      it through a little trap-hatch in the bottom. On the after side, or
      side next the stern of the ship, is a comfortable seat, with a locker
      underneath for umbrellas, comforters, and coats. In front is a leather
      rack, in which to keep your speaking trumpet, pipe, telescope, and
      other nautical conveniences. When Captain Sleet in person stood his
      mast-head in this crow’s-nest of his, he tells us that he always had a
      rifle with him (also fixed in the rack), together with a powder flask
      and shot, for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales, or
      vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters; for you cannot
      successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the
      water, but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing. Now, it
      was plainly a labor of love for Captain Sleet to describe, as he does,
      all the little detailed conveniences of his crow’s-nest; but though he
      so enlarges upon many of these, and though he treats us to a very
      scientific account of his experiments in this crow’s-nest, with a small
      compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors
      resulting from what is called the “local attraction” of all binnacle
      magnets; an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in
      the ship’s planks, and in the Glacier’s case, perhaps, to there having
      been so many broken-down blacksmiths among her crew; I say, that though
      the Captain is very discreet and scientific here, yet, for all his
      learned “binnacle deviations,” “azimuth compass observations,” and
      “approximate errors,” he knows very well, Captain Sleet, that he was
      not so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations, as to fail
      being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little
      case-bottle, so nicely tucked in on one side of his crow’s nest, within
      easy reach of his hand. Though, upon the whole, I greatly admire and
      even love the brave, the honest, and learned Captain; yet I take it
      very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that case-bottle,
      seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been, while
      with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics
      aloft there in that bird’s nest within three or four perches of the
      pole.
      
      But if we Southern whale-fishers are not so snugly housed aloft as
      Captain Sleet and his Greenlandmen were; yet that disadvantage is
      greatly counter-balanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those
      seductive seas in which we South fishers mostly float. For one, I used
      to lounge up the rigging very leisurely, resting in the top to have a
      chat with Queequeg, or any one else off duty whom I might find there;
      then ascending a little way further, and throwing a lazy leg over the
      top-sail yard, take a preliminary view of the watery pastures, and so
      at last mount to my ultimate destination.
      
      Let me make a clean breast of it here, and frankly admit that I kept
      but sorry guard. With the problem of the universe revolving in me, how
      could I—being left completely to myself at such a thought-engendering
      altitude—how could I but lightly hold my obligations to observe all
      whale-ships’ standing orders, “Keep your weather eye open, and sing out
      every time.”
      
      And let me in this place movingly admonish you, ye ship-owners of
      Nantucket! Beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with
      lean brow and hollow eye; given to unseasonable meditativeness; and who
      offers to ship with the Phædon instead of Bowditch in his head. Beware
      of such an one, I say; your whales must be seen before they can be
      killed; and this sunken-eyed young Platonist will tow you ten wakes
      round the world, and never make you one pint of sperm the richer. Nor
      are these monitions at all unneeded. For nowadays, the whale-fishery
      furnishes an asylum for many romantic, melancholy, and absent-minded
      young men, disgusted with the carking cares of earth, and seeking
      sentiment in tar and blubber. Childe Harold not unfrequently perches
      himself upon the mast-head of some luckless disappointed whale-ship,
      and in moody phrase ejaculates:—
      
      
      “Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll! Ten thousand
      blubber-hunters sweep over thee in vain.”
      
      
      
      Very often do the captains of such ships take those absent-minded young
      philosophers to task, upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient
      “interest” in the voyage; half-hinting that they are so hopelessly lost
      to all honorable ambition, as that in their secret souls they would
      rather not see whales than otherwise. But all in vain; those young
      Platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect; they are
      short-sighted; what use, then, to strain the visual nerve? They have
      left their opera-glasses at home.
      
      “Why, thou monkey,” said a harpooneer to one of these lads, “we’ve been
      cruising now hard upon three years, and thou hast not raised a whale
      yet. Whales are scarce as hen’s teeth whenever thou art up here.”
      Perhaps they were; or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in
      the far horizon; but lulled into such an opium-like listlessness of
      vacant, unconscious reverie is this absent-minded youth by the blending
      cadence of waves with thoughts, that at last he loses his identity;
      takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep,
      blue, bottomless soul, pervading mankind and nature; and every strange,
      half-seen, gliding, beautiful thing that eludes him; every
      dimly-discovered, uprising fin of some undiscernible form, seems to him
      the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by
      continually flitting through it. In this enchanted mood, thy spirit
      ebbs away to whence it came; becomes diffused through time and space;
      like Cranmer’s sprinkled Pantheistic ashes, forming at last a part of
      every shore the round globe over.
      
      There is no life in thee, now, except that rocking life imparted by a
      gently rolling ship; by her, borrowed from the sea; by the sea, from
      the inscrutable tides of God. But while this sleep, this dream is on
      ye, move your foot or hand an inch; slip your hold at all; and your
      identity comes back in horror. Over Descartian vortices you hover. And
      perhaps, at mid-day, in the fairest weather, with one half-throttled
      shriek you drop through that transparent air into the summer sea, no
      more to rise for ever. Heed it well, ye Pantheists!
      
      
      CHAPTER 36. The Quarter-Deck.
      
      (_Enter Ahab: Then, all._)
      
      It was not a great while after the affair of the pipe, that one morning
      shortly after breakfast, Ahab, as was his wont, ascended the
      cabin-gangway to the deck. There most sea-captains usually walk at that
      hour, as country gentlemen, after the same meal, take a few turns in
      the garden.
      
      Soon his steady, ivory stride was heard, as to and fro he paced his old
      rounds, upon planks so familiar to his tread, that they were all over
      dented, like geological stones, with the peculiar mark of his walk. Did
      you fixedly gaze, too, upon that ribbed and dented brow; there also,
      you would see still stranger foot-prints—the foot-prints of his one
      unsleeping, ever-pacing thought.
      
      But on the occasion in question, those dents looked deeper, even as his
      nervous step that morning left a deeper mark. And, so full of his
      thought was Ahab, that at every uniform turn that he made, now at the
      main-mast and now at the binnacle, you could almost see that thought
      turn in him as he turned, and pace in him as he paced; so completely
      possessing him, indeed, that it all but seemed the inward mould of
      every outer movement.
      
      “D’ye mark him, Flask?” whispered Stubb; “the chick that’s in him pecks
      the shell. ’Twill soon be out.”
      
      The hours wore on;—Ahab now shut up within his cabin; anon, pacing the
      deck, with the same intense bigotry of purpose in his aspect.
      
      It drew near the close of day. Suddenly he came to a halt by the
      bulwarks, and inserting his bone leg into the auger-hole there, and
      with one hand grasping a shroud, he ordered Starbuck to send everybody
      aft.
      
      “Sir!” said the mate, astonished at an order seldom or never given on
      ship-board except in some extraordinary case.
      
      “Send everybody aft,” repeated Ahab. “Mast-heads, there! come down!”
      
      When the entire ship’s company were assembled, and with curious and not
      wholly unapprehensive faces, were eyeing him, for he looked not unlike
      the weather horizon when a storm is coming up, Ahab, after rapidly
      glancing over the bulwarks, and then darting his eyes among the crew,
      started from his standpoint; and as though not a soul were nigh him
      resumed his heavy turns upon the deck. With bent head and half-slouched
      hat he continued to pace, unmindful of the wondering whispering among
      the men; till Stubb cautiously whispered to Flask, that Ahab must have
      summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat.
      But this did not last long. Vehemently pausing, he cried:—
      
      “What do ye do when ye see a whale, men?”
      
      “Sing out for him!” was the impulsive rejoinder from a score of clubbed
      voices.
      
      “Good!” cried Ahab, with a wild approval in his tones; observing the
      hearty animation into which his unexpected question had so magnetically
      thrown them.
      
      “And what do ye next, men?”
      
      “Lower away, and after him!”
      
      “And what tune is it ye pull to, men?”
      
      “A dead whale or a stove boat!”
      
      More and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving, grew the
      countenance of the old man at every shout; while the mariners began to
      gaze curiously at each other, as if marvelling how it was that they
      themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions.
      
      But, they were all eagerness again, as Ahab, now half-revolving in his
      pivot-hole, with one hand reaching high up a shroud, and tightly,
      almost convulsively grasping it, addressed them thus:—
      
      “All ye mast-headers have before now heard me give orders about a white
      whale. Look ye! d’ye see this Spanish ounce of gold?”—holding up a
      broad bright coin to the sun—“it is a sixteen dollar piece, men. D’ye
      see it? Mr. Starbuck, hand me yon top-maul.”
      
      While the mate was getting the hammer, Ahab, without speaking, was
      slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket, as if
      to heighten its lustre, and without using any words was meanwhile lowly
      humming to himself, producing a sound so strangely muffled and
      inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his
      vitality in him.
      
      Receiving the top-maul from Starbuck, he advanced towards the main-mast
      with the hammer uplifted in one hand, exhibiting the gold with the
      other, and with a high raised voice exclaiming: “Whosoever of ye raises
      me a white-headed whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw;
      whosoever of ye raises me that white-headed whale, with three holes
      punctured in his starboard fluke—look ye, whosoever of ye raises me
      that same white whale, he shall have this gold ounce, my boys!”
      
      “Huzza! huzza!” cried the seamen, as with swinging tarpaulins they
      hailed the act of nailing the gold to the mast.
      
      “It’s a white whale, I say,” resumed Ahab, as he threw down the
      topmaul: “a white whale. Skin your eyes for him, men; look sharp for
      white water; if ye see but a bubble, sing out.”
      
      All this while Tashtego, Daggoo, and Queequeg had looked on with even
      more intense interest and surprise than the rest, and at the mention of
      the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was
      separately touched by some specific recollection.
      
      “Captain Ahab,” said Tashtego, “that white whale must be the same that
      some call Moby Dick.”
      
      “Moby Dick?” shouted Ahab. “Do ye know the white whale then, Tash?”
      
      “Does he fan-tail a little curious, sir, before he goes down?” said the
      Gay-Header deliberately.
      
      “And has he a curious spout, too,” said Daggoo, “very bushy, even for a
      parmacetty, and mighty quick, Captain Ahab?”
      
      “And he have one, two, three—oh! good many iron in him hide, too,
      Captain,” cried Queequeg disjointedly, “all twiske-tee be-twisk, like
      him—him—” faltering hard for a word, and screwing his hand round and
      round as though uncorking a bottle—“like him—him—”
      
      “Corkscrew!” cried Ahab, “aye, Queequeg, the harpoons lie all twisted
      and wrenched in him; aye, Daggoo, his spout is a big one, like a whole
      shock of wheat, and white as a pile of our Nantucket wool after the
      great annual sheep-shearing; aye, Tashtego, and he fan-tails like a
      split jib in a squall. Death and devils! men, it is Moby Dick ye have
      seen—Moby Dick—Moby Dick!”
      
      “Captain Ahab,” said Starbuck, who, with Stubb and Flask, had thus far
      been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise, but at last seemed
      struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder. “Captain
      Ahab, I have heard of Moby Dick—but it was not Moby Dick that took off
      thy leg?”
      
      “Who told thee that?” cried Ahab; then pausing, “Aye, Starbuck; aye, my
      hearties all round; it was Moby Dick that dismasted me; Moby Dick that
      brought me to this dead stump I stand on now. Aye, aye,” he shouted
      with a terrific, loud, animal sob, like that of a heart-stricken moose;
      “Aye, aye! it was that accursed white whale that razed me; made a poor
      pegging lubber of me for ever and a day!” Then tossing both arms, with
      measureless imprecations he shouted out: “Aye, aye! and I’ll chase him
      round Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round the Norway Maelstrom,
      and round perdition’s flames before I give him up. And this is what ye
      have shipped for, men! to chase that white whale on both sides of land,
      and over all sides of earth, till he spouts black blood and rolls fin
      out. What say ye, men, will ye splice hands on it, now? I think ye do
      look brave.”
      
      “Aye, aye!” shouted the harpooneers and seamen, running closer to the
      excited old man: “A sharp eye for the white whale; a sharp lance for
      Moby Dick!”
      
      “God bless ye,” he seemed to half sob and half shout. “God bless ye,
      men. Steward! go draw the great measure of grog. But what’s this long
      face about, Mr. Starbuck; wilt thou not chase the white whale? art not
      game for Moby Dick?”
      
      “I am game for his crooked jaw, and for the jaws of Death too, Captain
      Ahab, if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow; but I
      came here to hunt whales, not my commander’s vengeance. How many
      barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it, Captain
      Ahab? it will not fetch thee much in our Nantucket market.”
      
      “Nantucket market! Hoot! But come closer, Starbuck; thou requirest a
      little lower layer. If money’s to be the measurer, man, and the
      accountants have computed their great counting-house the globe, by
      girdling it with guineas, one to every three parts of an inch; then,
      let me tell thee, that my vengeance will fetch a great premium _here!_”
      
      “He smites his chest,” whispered Stubb, “what’s that for? methinks it
      rings most vast, but hollow.”
      
      “Vengeance on a dumb brute!” cried Starbuck, “that simply smote thee
      from blindest instinct! Madness! To be enraged with a dumb thing,
      Captain Ahab, seems blasphemous.”
      
      “Hark ye yet again—the little lower layer. All visible objects, man,
      are but as pasteboard masks. But in each event—in the living act, the
      undoubted deed—there, some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth
      the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask. If man
      will strike, strike through the mask! How can the prisoner reach
      outside except by thrusting through the wall? To me, the white whale is
      that wall, shoved near to me. Sometimes I think there’s naught beyond.
      But ’tis enough. He tasks me; he heaps me; I see in him outrageous
      strength, with an inscrutable malice sinewing it. That inscrutable
      thing is chiefly what I hate; and be the white whale agent, or be the
      white whale principal, I will wreak that hate upon him. Talk not to me
      of blasphemy, man; I’d strike the sun if it insulted me. For could the
      sun do that, then could I do the other; since there is ever a sort of
      fair play herein, jealousy presiding over all creations. But not my
      master, man, is even that fair play. Who’s over me? Truth hath no
      confines. Take off thine eye! more intolerable than fiends’ glarings is
      a doltish stare! So, so; thou reddenest and palest; my heat has melted
      thee to anger-glow. But look ye, Starbuck, what is said in heat, that
      thing unsays itself. There are men from whom warm words are small
      indignity. I meant not to incense thee. Let it go. Look! see yonder
      Turkish cheeks of spotted tawn—living, breathing pictures painted by
      the sun. The Pagan leopards—the unrecking and unworshipping things,
      that live; and seek, and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel!
      The crew, man, the crew! Are they not one and all with Ahab, in this
      matter of the whale? See Stubb! he laughs! See yonder Chilian! he
      snorts to think of it. Stand up amid the general hurricane, thy one
      tost sapling cannot, Starbuck! And what is it? Reckon it. ’Tis but to
      help strike a fin; no wondrous feat for Starbuck. What is it more? From
      this one poor hunt, then, the best lance out of all Nantucket, surely
      he will not hang back, when every foremast-hand has clutched a
      whetstone? Ah! constrainings seize thee; I see! the billow lifts thee!
      Speak, but speak!—Aye, aye! thy silence, then, _that_ voices thee.
      (_Aside_) Something shot from my dilated nostrils, he has inhaled it in
      his lungs. Starbuck now is mine; cannot oppose me now, without
      rebellion.”
      
      “God keep me!—keep us all!” murmured Starbuck, lowly.
      
      But in his joy at the enchanted, tacit acquiescence of the mate, Ahab
      did not hear his foreboding invocation; nor yet the low laugh from the
      hold; nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage; nor
      yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts, as for a moment
      their hearts sank in. For again Starbuck’s downcast eyes lighted up
      with the stubbornness of life; the subterranean laugh died away; the
      winds blew on; the sails filled out; the ship heaved and rolled as
      before. Ah, ye admonitions and warnings! why stay ye not when ye come?
      But rather are ye predictions than warnings, ye shadows! Yet not so
      much predictions from without, as verifications of the foregoing things
      within. For with little external to constrain us, the innermost
      necessities in our being, these still drive us on.
      
      “The measure! the measure!” cried Ahab.
      
      Receiving the brimming pewter, and turning to the harpooneers, he
      ordered them to produce their weapons. Then ranging them before him
      near the capstan, with their harpoons in their hands, while his three
      mates stood at his side with their lances, and the rest of the ship’s
      company formed a circle round the group; he stood for an instant
      searchingly eyeing every man of his crew. But those wild eyes met his,
      as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their
      leader, ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison; but,
      alas! only to fall into the hidden snare of the Indian.
      
      “Drink and pass!” he cried, handing the heavy charged flagon to the
      nearest seaman. “The crew alone now drink. Round with it, round! Short
      draughts—long swallows, men; ’tis hot as Satan’s hoof. So, so; it goes
      round excellently. It spiralizes in ye; forks out at the
      serpent-snapping eye. Well done; almost drained. That way it went, this
      way it comes. Hand it me—here’s a hollow! Men, ye seem the years; so
      brimming life is gulped and gone. Steward, refill!
      
      “Attend now, my braves. I have mustered ye all round this capstan; and
      ye mates, flank me with your lances; and ye harpooneers, stand there
      with your irons; and ye, stout mariners, ring me in, that I may in some
      sort revive a noble custom of my fisherman fathers before me. O men,
      you will yet see that—Ha! boy, come back? bad pennies come not sooner.
      Hand it me. Why, now, this pewter had run brimming again, wer’t not
      thou St. Vitus’ imp—away, thou ague!
      
      “Advance, ye mates! Cross your lances full before me. Well done! Let me
      touch the axis.” So saying, with extended arm, he grasped the three
      level, radiating lances at their crossed centre; while so doing,
      suddenly and nervously twitched them; meanwhile, glancing intently from
      Starbuck to Stubb; from Stubb to Flask. It seemed as though, by some
      nameless, interior volition, he would fain have shocked into them the
      same fiery emotion accumulated within the Leyden jar of his own
      magnetic life. The three mates quailed before his strong, sustained,
      and mystic aspect. Stubb and Flask looked sideways from him; the honest
      eye of Starbuck fell downright.
      
      “In vain!” cried Ahab; “but, maybe, ’tis well. For did ye three but
      once take the full-forced shock, then mine own electric thing, _that_
      had perhaps expired from out me. Perchance, too, it would have dropped
      ye dead. Perchance ye need it not. Down lances! And now, ye mates, I do
      appoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen there—yon three
      most honorable gentlemen and noblemen, my valiant harpooneers. Disdain
      the task? What, when the great Pope washes the feet of beggars, using
      his tiara for ewer? Oh, my sweet cardinals! your own condescension,
      _that_ shall bend ye to it. I do not order ye; ye will it. Cut your
      seizings and draw the poles, ye harpooneers!”
      
      Silently obeying the order, the three harpooneers now stood with the
      detached iron part of their harpoons, some three feet long, held, barbs
      up, before him.
      
      “Stab me not with that keen steel! Cant them; cant them over! know ye
      not the goblet end? Turn up the socket! So, so; now, ye cup-bearers,
      advance. The irons! take them; hold them while I fill!” Forthwith,
      slowly going from one officer to the other, he brimmed the harpoon
      sockets with the fiery waters from the pewter.
      
      “Now, three to three, ye stand. Commend the murderous chalices! Bestow
      them, ye who are now made parties to this indissoluble league. Ha!
      Starbuck! but the deed is done! Yon ratifying sun now waits to sit upon
      it. Drink, ye harpooneers! drink and swear, ye men that man the
      deathful whaleboat’s bow—Death to Moby Dick! God hunt us all, if we do
      not hunt Moby Dick to his death!” The long, barbed steel goblets were
      lifted; and to cries and maledictions against the white whale, the
      spirits were simultaneously quaffed down with a hiss. Starbuck paled,
      and turned, and shivered. Once more, and finally, the replenished
      pewter went the rounds among the frantic crew; when, waving his free
      hand to them, they all dispersed; and Ahab retired within his cabin.
      
      
      CHAPTER 37. Sunset.
      
      _The cabin; by the stern windows; Ahab sitting alone, and gazing out_.
      
      I leave a white and turbid wake; pale waters, paler cheeks, where’er I
      sail. The envious billows sidelong swell to whelm my track; let them;
      but first I pass.
      
      Yonder, by ever-brimming goblet’s rim, the warm waves blush like wine.
      The gold brow plumbs the blue. The diver sun—slow dived from noon—goes
      down; my soul mounts up! she wearies with her endless hill. Is, then,
      the crown too heavy that I wear? this Iron Crown of Lombardy. Yet is it
      bright with many a gem; I the wearer, see not its far flashings; but
      darkly feel that I wear that, that dazzlingly confounds. ’Tis iron—that
      I know—not gold. ’Tis split, too—that I feel; the jagged edge galls me
      so, my brain seems to beat against the solid metal; aye, steel skull,
      mine; the sort that needs no helmet in the most brain-battering fight!
      
      Dry heat upon my brow? Oh! time was, when as the sunrise nobly spurred
      me, so the sunset soothed. No more. This lovely light, it lights not
      me; all loveliness is anguish to me, since I can ne’er enjoy. Gifted
      with the high perception, I lack the low, enjoying power; damned, most
      subtly and most malignantly! damned in the midst of Paradise! Good
      night—good night! (_waving his hand, he moves from the window_.)
      
      ’Twas not so hard a task. I thought to find one stubborn, at the least;
      but my one cogged circle fits into all their various wheels, and they
      revolve. Or, if you will, like so many ant-hills of powder, they all
      stand before me; and I their match. Oh, hard! that to fire others, the
      match itself must needs be wasting! What I’ve dared, I’ve willed; and
      what I’ve willed, I’ll do! They think me mad—Starbuck does; but I’m
      demoniac, I am madness maddened! That wild madness that’s only calm to
      comprehend itself! The prophecy was that I should be dismembered;
      and—Aye! I lost this leg. I now prophesy that I will dismember my
      dismemberer. Now, then, be the prophet and the fulfiller one. That’s
      more than ye, ye great gods, ever were. I laugh and hoot at ye, ye
      cricket-players, ye pugilists, ye deaf Burkes and blinded Bendigoes! I
      will not say as schoolboys do to bullies—Take some one of your own
      size; don’t pommel _me!_ No, ye’ve knocked me down, and I am up again;
      but _ye_ have run and hidden. Come forth from behind your cotton bags!
      I have no long gun to reach ye. Come, Ahab’s compliments to ye; come
      and see if ye can swerve me. Swerve me? ye cannot swerve me, else ye
      swerve yourselves! man has ye there. Swerve me? The path to my fixed
      purpose is laid with iron rails, whereon my soul is grooved to run.
      Over unsounded gorges, through the rifled hearts of mountains, under
      torrents’ beds, unerringly I rush! Naught’s an obstacle, naught’s an
      angle to the iron way!
      
      
      CHAPTER 38. Dusk.
      
      _By the Mainmast; Starbuck leaning against it_.
      
      My soul is more than matched; she’s overmanned; and by a madman!
      Insufferable sting, that sanity should ground arms on such a field! But
      he drilled deep down, and blasted all my reason out of me! I think I
      see his impious end; but feel that I must help him to it. Will I, nill
      I, the ineffable thing has tied me to him; tows me with a cable I have
      no knife to cut. Horrible old man! Who’s over him, he cries;—aye, he
      would be a democrat to all above; look, how he lords it over all below!
      Oh! I plainly see my miserable office,—to obey, rebelling; and worse
      yet, to hate with touch of pity! For in his eyes I read some lurid woe
      would shrivel me up, had I it. Yet is there hope. Time and tide flow
      wide. The hated whale has the round watery world to swim in, as the
      small gold-fish has its glassy globe. His heaven-insulting purpose, God
      may wedge aside. I would up heart, were it not like lead. But my whole
      clock’s run down; my heart the all-controlling weight, I have no key to
      lift again.
      
      [_A burst of revelry from the forecastle_.]
      
      Oh, God! to sail with such a heathen crew that have small touch of
      human mothers in them! Whelped somewhere by the sharkish sea. The white
      whale is their demigorgon. Hark! the infernal orgies! that revelry is
      forward! mark the unfaltering silence aft! Methinks it pictures life.
      Foremost through the sparkling sea shoots on the gay, embattled,
      bantering bow, but only to drag dark Ahab after it, where he broods
      within his sternward cabin, builded over the dead water of the wake,
      and further on, hunted by its wolfish gurglings. The long howl thrills
      me through! Peace! ye revellers, and set the watch! Oh, life! ’tis in
      an hour like this, with soul beat down and held to knowledge,—as wild,
      untutored things are forced to feed—Oh, life! ’tis now that I do feel
      the latent horror in thee! but ’tis not me! that horror’s out of me!
      and with the soft feeling of the human in me, yet will I try to fight
      ye, ye grim, phantom futures! Stand by me, hold me, bind me, O ye
      blessed influences!
      
      
      CHAPTER 39. First Night-Watch.
      
      Fore-Top.
      
      (_Stubb solus, and mending a brace_.)
      
      Ha! ha! ha! ha! hem! clear my throat!—I’ve been thinking over it ever
      since, and that ha, ha’s the final consequence. Why so? Because a
      laugh’s the wisest, easiest answer to all that’s queer; and come what
      will, one comfort’s always left—that unfailing comfort is, it’s all
      predestinated. I heard not all his talk with Starbuck; but to my poor
      eye Starbuck then looked something as I the other evening felt. Be sure
      the old Mogul has fixed him, too. I twigged it, knew it; had had the
      gift, might readily have prophesied it—for when I clapped my eye upon
      his skull I saw it. Well, Stubb, _wise_ Stubb—that’s my title—well,
      Stubb, what of it, Stubb? Here’s a carcase. I know not all that may be
      coming, but be it what it will, I’ll go to it laughing. Such a waggish
      leering as lurks in all your horribles! I feel funny. Fa, la! lirra,
      skirra! What’s my juicy little pear at home doing now? Crying its eyes
      out?—Giving a party to the last arrived harpooneers, I dare say, gay as
      a frigate’s pennant, and so am I—fa, la! lirra, skirra! Oh—
      
      
      We’ll drink to-night with hearts as light, To love, as gay and fleeting
      As bubbles that swim, on the beaker’s brim, And break on the lips while
      meeting.
      
      
      
      A brave stave that—who calls? Mr. Starbuck? Aye, aye, sir—(_Aside_)
      he’s my superior, he has his too, if I’m not mistaken.—Aye, aye, sir,
      just through with this job—coming.
      
      
      CHAPTER 40. Midnight, Forecastle.
      
      HARPOONEERS AND SAILORS.
      
      (_Foresail rises and discovers the watch standing, lounging, leaning,
      and lying in various attitudes, all singing in chorus_.)
      
      
        Farewell and adieu to you, Spanish ladies! Farewell and adieu to you,
        ladies of Spain! Our captain’s commanded.—
      
      
      
      1ST NANTUCKET SAILOR. Oh, boys, don’t be sentimental; it’s bad for the
      digestion! Take a tonic, follow me!
      
      (_Sings, and all follow._)
      
      
       Our captain stood upon the deck, A spy-glass in his hand, A viewing of
       those gallant whales That blew at every strand. Oh, your tubs in your
       boats, my boys, And by your braces stand, And we’ll have one of those
       fine whales, Hand, boys, over hand! So, be cheery, my lads! may your
       hearts never fail! While the bold harpooner is striking the whale!
      
      
      
      MATE’S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK. Eight bells there, forward!
      
      2ND NANTUCKET SAILOR. Avast the chorus! Eight bells there! d’ye hear,
      bell-boy? Strike the bell eight, thou Pip! thou blackling! and let me
      call the watch. I’ve the sort of mouth for that—the hogshead mouth. So,
      so, (_thrusts his head down the scuttle_,) Star-bo-l-e-e-n-s, a-h-o-y!
      Eight bells there below! Tumble up!
      
      DUTCH SAILOR. Grand snoozing to-night, maty; fat night for that. I mark
      this in our old Mogul’s wine; it’s quite as deadening to some as
      filliping to others. We sing; they sleep—aye, lie down there, like
      ground-tier butts. At ’em again! There, take this copper-pump, and hail
      ’em through it. Tell ’em to avast dreaming of their lasses. Tell ’em
      it’s the resurrection; they must kiss their last, and come to judgment.
      That’s the way—_that’s_ it; thy throat ain’t spoiled with eating
      Amsterdam butter.
      
      FRENCH SAILOR. Hist, boys! let’s have a jig or two before we ride to
      anchor in Blanket Bay. What say ye? There comes the other watch. Stand
      by all legs! Pip! little Pip! hurrah with your tambourine!
      
      PIP. (_Sulky and sleepy._) Don’t know where it is.
      
      FRENCH SAILOR. Beat thy belly, then, and wag thy ears. Jig it, men, I
      say; merry’s the word; hurrah! Damn me, won’t you dance? Form, now,
      Indian-file, and gallop into the double-shuffle? Throw yourselves!
      Legs! legs!
      
      ICELAND SAILOR. I don’t like your floor, maty; it’s too springy to my
      taste. I’m used to ice-floors. I’m sorry to throw cold water on the
      subject; but excuse me.
      
      MALTESE SAILOR. Me too; where’s your girls? Who but a fool would take
      his left hand by his right, and say to himself, how d’ye do? Partners!
      I must have partners!
      
      SICILIAN SAILOR. Aye; girls and a green!—then I’ll hop with ye; yea,
      turn grasshopper!
      
      LONG-ISLAND SAILOR. Well, well, ye sulkies, there’s plenty more of us.
      Hoe corn when you may, say I. All legs go to harvest soon. Ah! here
      comes the music; now for it!
      
      AZORE SAILOR. (_Ascending, and pitching the tambourine up the
      scuttle_.) Here you are, Pip; and there’s the windlass-bitts; up you
      mount! Now, boys! (_The half of them dance to the tambourine; some go
      below; some sleep or lie among the coils of rigging. Oaths a-plenty_.)
      
      AZORE SAILOR. (_Dancing_) Go it, Pip! Bang it, bell-boy! Rig it, dig
      it, stig it, quig it, bell-boy! Make fire-flies; break the jinglers!
      
      PIP. Jinglers, you say?—there goes another, dropped off; I pound it so.
      
      CHINA SAILOR. Rattle thy teeth, then, and pound away; make a pagoda of
      thyself.
      
      FRENCH SAILOR. Merry-mad! Hold up thy hoop, Pip, till I jump through
      it! Split jibs! tear yourselves!
      
      TASHTEGO. (_Quietly smoking._) That’s a white man; he calls that fun:
      humph! I save my sweat.
      
      OLD MANX SAILOR. I wonder whether those jolly lads bethink them of what
      they are dancing over. I’ll dance over your grave, I will—that’s the
      bitterest threat of your night-women, that beat head-winds round
      corners. O Christ! to think of the green navies and the green-skulled
      crews! Well, well; belike the whole world’s a ball, as you scholars
      have it; and so ’tis right to make one ballroom of it. Dance on, lads,
      you’re young; I was once.
      
      3D NANTUCKET SAILOR. Spell oh!—whew! this is worse than pulling after
      whales in a calm—give us a whiff, Tash.
      
      (_They cease dancing, and gather in clusters. Meantime the sky
      darkens—the wind rises_.)
      
      LASCAR SAILOR. By Brahma! boys, it’ll be douse sail soon. The sky-born,
      high-tide Ganges turned to wind! Thou showest thy black brow, Seeva!
      
      MALTESE SAILOR. (_Reclining and shaking his cap_.) It’s the waves—the
      snow’s caps turn to jig it now. They’ll shake their tassels soon. Now
      would all the waves were women, then I’d go drown, and chassee with
      them evermore! There’s naught so sweet on earth—heaven may not match
      it!—as those swift glances of warm, wild bosoms in the dance, when the
      over-arboring arms hide such ripe, bursting grapes.
      
      SICILIAN SAILOR. (_Reclining_.) Tell me not of it! Hark ye, lad—fleet
      interlacings of the limbs—lithe swayings—coyings—flutterings! lip!
      heart! hip! all graze: unceasing touch and go! not taste, observe ye,
      else come satiety. Eh, Pagan? (_Nudging_.)
      
      TAHITAN SAILOR. (_Reclining on a mat_.) Hail, holy nakedness of our
      dancing girls!—the Heeva-Heeva! Ah! low veiled, high palmed Tahiti! I
      still rest me on thy mat, but the soft soil has slid! I saw thee woven
      in the wood, my mat! green the first day I brought ye thence; now worn
      and wilted quite. Ah me!—not thou nor I can bear the change! How then,
      if so be transplanted to yon sky? Hear I the roaring streams from
      Pirohitee’s peak of spears, when they leap down the crags and drown the
      villages?—The blast! the blast! Up, spine, and meet it! (_Leaps to his
      feet_.)
      
      PORTUGUESE SAILOR. How the sea rolls swashing ’gainst the side! Stand
      by for reefing, hearties! the winds are just crossing swords, pell-mell
      they’ll go lunging presently.
      
      DANISH SAILOR. Crack, crack, old ship! so long as thou crackest, thou
      holdest! Well done! The mate there holds ye to it stiffly. He’s no more
      afraid than the isle fort at Cattegat, put there to fight the Baltic
      with storm-lashed guns, on which the sea-salt cakes!
      
      4TH NANTUCKET SAILOR. He has his orders, mind ye that. I heard old Ahab
      tell him he must always kill a squall, something as they burst a
      waterspout with a pistol—fire your ship right into it!
      
      ENGLISH SAILOR. Blood! but that old man’s a grand old cove! We are the
      lads to hunt him up his whale!
      
      ALL. Aye! aye!
      
      OLD MANX SAILOR. How the three pines shake! Pines are the hardest sort
      of tree to live when shifted to any other soil, and here there’s none
      but the crew’s cursed clay. Steady, helmsman! steady. This is the sort
      of weather when brave hearts snap ashore, and keeled hulls split at
      sea. Our captain has his birthmark; look yonder, boys, there’s another
      in the sky—lurid-like, ye see, all else pitch black.
      
      DAGGOO. What of that? Who’s afraid of black’s afraid of me! I’m
      quarried out of it!
      
      SPANISH SAILOR. (_Aside_.) He wants to bully, ah!—the old grudge makes
      me touchy (_Advancing_.) Aye, harpooneer, thy race is the undeniable
      dark side of mankind—devilish dark at that. No offence.
      
      DAGGOO (_grimly_). None.
      
      ST. JAGO’S SAILOR. That Spaniard’s mad or drunk. But that can’t be, or
      else in his one case our old Mogul’s fire-waters are somewhat long in
      working.
      
      5TH NANTUCKET SAILOR. What’s that I saw—lightning? Yes.
      
      SPANISH SAILOR. No; Daggoo showing his teeth.
      
      DAGGOO (_springing_). Swallow thine, mannikin! White skin, white liver!
      
      SPANISH SAILOR (_meeting him_). Knife thee heartily! big frame, small
      spirit!
      
      ALL. A row! a row! a row!
      
      TASHTEGO (_with a whiff_). A row a’low, and a row aloft—Gods and
      men—both brawlers! Humph!
      
      BELFAST SAILOR. A row! arrah a row! The Virgin be blessed, a row!
      Plunge in with ye!
      
      ENGLISH SAILOR. Fair play! Snatch the Spaniard’s knife! A ring, a ring!
      
      OLD MANX SAILOR. Ready formed. There! the ringed horizon. In that ring
      Cain struck Abel. Sweet work, right work! No? Why then, God, mad’st
      thou the ring?
      
      MATE’S VOICE FROM THE QUARTER-DECK. Hands by the halyards! in
      top-gallant sails! Stand by to reef topsails!
      
      ALL. The squall! the squall! jump, my jollies! (_They scatter_.)
      
      PIP (_shrinking under the windlass_). Jollies? Lord help such jollies!
      Crish, crash! there goes the jib-stay! Blang-whang! God! Duck lower,
      Pip, here comes the royal yard! It’s worse than being in the whirled
      woods, the last day of the year! Who’d go climbing after chestnuts now?
      But there they go, all cursing, and here I don’t. Fine prospects to
      ’em; they’re on the road to heaven. Hold on hard! Jimmini, what a
      squall! But those chaps there are worse yet—they are your white
      squalls, they. White squalls? white whale, shirr! shirr! Here have I
      heard all their chat just now, and the white whale—shirr! shirr!—but
      spoken of once! and only this evening—it makes me jingle all over like
      my tambourine—that anaconda of an old man swore ’em in to hunt him! Oh,
      thou big white God aloft there somewhere in yon darkness, have mercy on
      this small black boy down here; preserve him from all men that have no
      bowels to feel fear!
      
      
      CHAPTER 41. Moby Dick.
      
      I, Ishmael, was one of that crew; my shouts had gone up with the rest;
      my oath had been welded with theirs; and stronger I shouted, and more
      did I hammer and clinch my oath, because of the dread in my soul. A
      wild, mystical, sympathetical feeling was in me; Ahab’s quenchless feud
      seemed mine. With greedy ears I learned the history of that murderous
      monster against whom I and all the others had taken our oaths of
      violence and revenge.
      
      For some time past, though at intervals only, the unaccompanied,
      secluded White Whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly
      frequented by the Sperm Whale fishermen. But not all of them knew of
      his existence; only a few of them, comparatively, had knowingly seen
      him; while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given
      battle to him, was small indeed. For, owing to the large number of
      whale-cruisers; the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire
      watery circumference, many of them adventurously pushing their quest
      along solitary latitudes, so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth
      or more on a stretch, to encounter a single news-telling sail of any
      sort; the inordinate length of each separate voyage; the irregularity
      of the times of sailing from home; all these, with other circumstances,
      direct and indirect, long obstructed the spread through the whole
      world-wide whaling-fleet of the special individualizing tidings
      concerning Moby Dick. It was hardly to be doubted, that several vessels
      reported to have encountered, at such or such a time, or on such or
      such a meridian, a Sperm Whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity,
      which whale, after doing great mischief to his assailants, had
      completely escaped them; to some minds it was not an unfair
      presumption, I say, that the whale in question must have been no other
      than Moby Dick. Yet as of late the Sperm Whale fishery had been marked
      by various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity, cunning, and
      malice in the monster attacked; therefore it was, that those who by
      accident ignorantly gave battle to Moby Dick; such hunters, perhaps,
      for the most part, were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred,
      more, as it were, to the perils of the Sperm Whale fishery at large,
      than to the individual cause. In that way, mostly, the disastrous
      encounter between Ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly
      regarded.
      
      And as for those who, previously hearing of the White Whale, by chance
      caught sight of him; in the beginning of the thing they had every one
      of them, almost, as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him, as for any
      other whale of that species. But at length, such calamities did ensue
      in these assaults—not restricted to sprained wrists and ankles, broken
      limbs, or devouring amputations—but fatal to the last degree of
      fatality; those repeated disastrous repulses, all accumulating and
      piling their terrors upon Moby Dick; those things had gone far to shake
      the fortitude of many brave hunters, to whom the story of the White
      Whale had eventually come.
      
      Nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate, and still the more
      horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters. For not only do
      fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising
      terrible events,—as the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi; but, in
      maritime life, far more than in that of terra firma, wild rumors
      abound, wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to.
      And as the sea surpasses the land in this matter, so the whale fishery
      surpasses every other sort of maritime life, in the wonderfulness and
      fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there. For not only
      are whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and
      superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors; but of all sailors, they
      are by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever is
      appallingly astonishing in the sea; face to face they not only eye its
      greatest marvels, but, hand to jaw, give battle to them. Alone, in such
      remotest waters, that though you sailed a thousand miles, and passed a
      thousand shores, you would not come to any chiseled hearth-stone, or
      aught hospitable beneath that part of the sun; in such latitudes and
      longitudes, pursuing too such a calling as he does, the whaleman is
      wrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many
      a mighty birth.
      
      No wonder, then, that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over
      the widest watery spaces, the outblown rumors of the White Whale did in
      the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints, and
      half-formed fœtal suggestions of supernatural agencies, which
      eventually invested Moby Dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything
      that visibly appears. So that in many cases such a panic did he finally
      strike, that few who by those rumors, at least, had heard of the White
      Whale, few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his
      jaw.
      
      But there were still other and more vital practical influences at work.
      Not even at the present day has the original prestige of the Sperm
      Whale, as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the
      leviathan, died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body. There are
      those this day among them, who, though intelligent and courageous
      enough in offering battle to the Greenland or Right whale, would
      perhaps—either from professional inexperience, or incompetency, or
      timidity, decline a contest with the Sperm Whale; at any rate, there
      are plenty of whalemen, especially among those whaling nations not
      sailing under the American flag, who have never hostilely encountered
      the Sperm Whale, but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is
      restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the North;
      seated on their hatches, these men will hearken with a childish
      fireside interest and awe, to the wild, strange tales of Southern
      whaling. Nor is the pre-eminent tremendousness of the great Sperm Whale
      anywhere more feelingly comprehended, than on board of those prows
      which stem him.
      
      And as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary
      times thrown its shadow before it; we find some book
      naturalists—Olassen and Povelson—declaring the Sperm Whale not only to
      be a consternation to every other creature in the sea, but also to be
      so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood.
      Nor even down to so late a time as Cuvier’s, were these or almost
      similar impressions effaced. For in his Natural History, the Baron
      himself affirms that at sight of the Sperm Whale, all fish (sharks
      included) are “struck with the most lively terrors,” and “often in the
      precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with
      such violence as to cause instantaneous death.” And however the general
      experiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these; yet in
      their full terribleness, even to the bloodthirsty item of Povelson, the
      superstitious belief in them is, in some vicissitudes of their
      vocation, revived in the minds of the hunters.
      
      So that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him, not a few
      of the fishermen recalled, in reference to Moby Dick, the earlier days
      of the Sperm Whale fishery, when it was oftentimes hard to induce long
      practised Right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring
      warfare; such men protesting that although other leviathans might be
      hopefully pursued, yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition
      as the Sperm Whale was not for mortal man. That to attempt it, would be
      inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity. On this head, there are
      some remarkable documents that may be consulted.
      
      Nevertheless, some there were, who even in the face of these things
      were ready to give chase to Moby Dick; and a still greater number who,
      chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely, without the
      specific details of any certain calamity, and without superstitious
      accompaniments, were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if
      offered.
      
      One of the wild suggestions referred to, as at last coming to be linked
      with the White Whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined, was
      the unearthly conceit that Moby Dick was ubiquitous; that he had
      actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same
      instant of time.
      
      Nor, credulous as such minds must have been, was this conceit
      altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability. For as
      the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged,
      even to the most erudite research; so the hidden ways of the Sperm
      Whale when beneath the surface remain, in great part, unaccountable to
      his pursuers; and from time to time have originated the most curious
      and contradictory speculations regarding them, especially concerning
      the mystic modes whereby, after sounding to a great depth, he
      transports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant
      points.
      
      It is a thing well known to both American and English whale-ships, and
      as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by Scoresby,
      that some whales have been captured far north in the Pacific, in whose
      bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the Greenland
      seas. Nor is it to be gainsaid, that in some of these instances it has
      been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could
      not have exceeded very many days. Hence, by inference, it has been
      believed by some whalemen, that the Nor’ West Passage, so long a
      problem to man, was never a problem to the whale. So that here, in the
      real living experience of living men, the prodigies related in old
      times of the inland Strello mountain in Portugal (near whose top there
      was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the
      surface); and that still more wonderful story of the Arethusa fountain
      near Syracuse (whose waters were believed to have come from the Holy
      Land by an underground passage); these fabulous narrations are almost
      fully equalled by the realities of the whalemen.
      
      Forced into familiarity, then, with such prodigies as these; and
      knowing that after repeated, intrepid assaults, the White Whale had
      escaped alive; it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen
      should go still further in their superstitions; declaring Moby Dick not
      only ubiquitous, but immortal (for immortality is but ubiquity in
      time); that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks, he
      would still swim away unharmed; or if indeed he should ever be made to
      spout thick blood, such a sight would be but a ghastly deception; for
      again in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away, his unsullied
      jet would once more be seen.
      
      But even stripped of these supernatural surmisings, there was enough in
      the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike
      the imagination with unwonted power. For, it was not so much his
      uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales,
      but, as was elsewhere thrown out—a peculiar snow-white wrinkled
      forehead, and a high, pyramidical white hump. These were his prominent
      features; the tokens whereby, even in the limitless, uncharted seas, he
      revealed his identity, at a long distance, to those who knew him.
      
      The rest of his body was so streaked, and spotted, and marbled with the
      same shrouded hue, that, in the end, he had gained his distinctive
      appellation of the White Whale; a name, indeed, literally justified by
      his vivid aspect, when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue
      sea, leaving a milky-way wake of creamy foam, all spangled with golden
      gleamings.
      
      Nor was it his unwonted magnitude, nor his remarkable hue, nor yet his
      deformed lower jaw, that so much invested the whale with natural
      terror, as that unexampled, intelligent malignity which, according to
      specific accounts, he had over and over again evinced in his assaults.
      More than all, his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than
      perhaps aught else. For, when swimming before his exulting pursuers,
      with every apparent symptom of alarm, he had several times been known
      to turn round suddenly, and, bearing down upon them, either stave their
      boats to splinters, or drive them back in consternation to their ship.
      
      Already several fatalities had attended his chase. But though similar
      disasters, however little bruited ashore, were by no means unusual in
      the fishery; yet, in most instances, such seemed the White Whale’s
      infernal aforethought of ferocity, that every dismembering or death
      that he caused, was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an
      unintelligent agent.
      
      Judge, then, to what pitches of inflamed, distracted fury the minds of
      his more desperate hunters were impelled, when amid the chips of chewed
      boats, and the sinking limbs of torn comrades, they swam out of the
      white curds of the whale’s direful wrath into the serene, exasperating
      sunlight, that smiled on, as if at a birth or a bridal.
      
      His three boats stove around him, and oars and men both whirling in the
      eddies; one captain, seizing the line-knife from his broken prow, had
      dashed at the whale, as an Arkansas duellist at his foe, blindly
      seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathom-deep life of the
      whale. That captain was Ahab. And then it was, that suddenly sweeping
      his sickle-shaped lower jaw beneath him, Moby Dick had reaped away
      Ahab’s leg, as a mower a blade of grass in the field. No turbaned Turk,
      no hired Venetian or Malay, could have smote him with more seeming
      malice. Small reason was there to doubt, then, that ever since that
      almost fatal encounter, Ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness
      against the whale, all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness
      he at last came to identify with him, not only all his bodily woes, but
      all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations. The White Whale swam
      before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious
      agencies which some deep men feel eating in them, till they are left
      living on with half a heart and half a lung. That intangible malignity
      which has been from the beginning; to whose dominion even the modern
      Christians ascribe one-half of the worlds; which the ancient Ophites of
      the east reverenced in their statue devil;—Ahab did not fall down and
      worship it like them; but deliriously transferring its idea to the
      abhorred white whale, he pitted himself, all mutilated, against it. All
      that most maddens and torments; all that stirs up the lees of things;
      all truth with malice in it; all that cracks the sinews and cakes the
      brain; all the subtle demonisms of life and thought; all evil, to crazy
      Ahab, were visibly personified, and made practically assailable in Moby
      Dick. He piled upon the whale’s white hump the sum of all the general
      rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and then, as if
      his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart’s shell upon it.
      
      It is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at
      the precise time of his bodily dismemberment. Then, in darting at the
      monster, knife in hand, he had but given loose to a sudden, passionate,
      corporal animosity; and when he received the stroke that tore him, he
      probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration, but nothing more.
      Yet, when by this collision forced to turn towards home, and for long
      months of days and weeks, Ahab and anguish lay stretched together in
      one hammock, rounding in mid winter that dreary, howling Patagonian
      Cape; then it was, that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one
      another; and so interfusing, made him mad. That it was only then, on
      the homeward voyage, after the encounter, that the final monomania
      seized him, seems all but certain from the fact that, at intervals
      during the passage, he was a raving lunatic; and, though unlimbed of a
      leg, yet such vital strength yet lurked in his Egyptian chest, and was
      moreover intensified by his delirium, that his mates were forced to
      lace him fast, even there, as he sailed, raving in his hammock. In a
      strait-jacket, he swung to the mad rockings of the gales. And, when
      running into more sufferable latitudes, the ship, with mild stun’sails
      spread, floated across the tranquil tropics, and, to all appearances,
      the old man’s delirium seemed left behind him with the Cape Horn
      swells, and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and
      air; even then, when he bore that firm, collected front, however pale,
      and issued his calm orders once again; and his mates thanked God the
      direful madness was now gone; even then, Ahab, in his hidden self,
      raved on. Human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing.
      When you think it fled, it may have but become transfigured into some
      still subtler form. Ahab’s full lunacy subsided not, but deepeningly
      contracted; like the unabated Hudson, when that noble Northman flows
      narrowly, but unfathomably through the Highland gorge. But, as in his
      narrow-flowing monomania, not one jot of Ahab’s broad madness had been
      left behind; so in that broad madness, not one jot of his great natural
      intellect had perished. That before living agent, now became the living
      instrument. If such a furious trope may stand, his special lunacy
      stormed his general sanity, and carried it, and turned all its
      concentred cannon upon its own mad mark; so that far from having lost
      his strength, Ahab, to that one end, did now possess a thousand fold
      more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one
      reasonable object.
      
      This is much; yet Ahab’s larger, darker, deeper part remains unhinted.
      But vain to popularize profundities, and all truth is profound. Winding
      far down from within the very heart of this spiked Hotel de Cluny where
      we here stand—however grand and wonderful, now quit it;—and take your
      way, ye nobler, sadder souls, to those vast Roman halls of Thermes;
      where far beneath the fantastic towers of man’s upper earth, his root
      of grandeur, his whole awful essence sits in bearded state; an antique
      buried beneath antiquities, and throned on torsoes! So with a broken
      throne, the great gods mock that captive king; so like a Caryatid, he
      patient sits, upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of
      ages. Wind ye down there, ye prouder, sadder souls! question that
      proud, sad king! A family likeness! aye, he did beget ye, ye young
      exiled royalties; and from your grim sire only will the old
      State-secret come.
      
      Now, in his heart, Ahab had some glimpse of this, namely: all my means
      are sane, my motive and my object mad. Yet without power to kill, or
      change, or shun the fact; he likewise knew that to mankind he did long
      dissemble; in some sort, did still. But that thing of his dissembling
      was only subject to his perceptibility, not to his will determinate.
      Nevertheless, so well did he succeed in that dissembling, that when
      with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last, no Nantucketer thought him
      otherwise than but naturally grieved, and that to the quick, with the
      terrible casualty which had overtaken him.
      
      The report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly
      ascribed to a kindred cause. And so too, all the added moodiness which
      always afterwards, to the very day of sailing in the Pequod on the
      present voyage, sat brooding on his brow. Nor is it so very unlikely,
      that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage, on
      account of such dark symptoms, the calculating people of that prudent
      isle were inclined to harbor the conceit, that for those very reasons
      he was all the better qualified and set on edge, for a pursuit so full
      of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales. Gnawed within and
      scorched without, with the infixed, unrelenting fangs of some incurable
      idea; such an one, could he be found, would seem the very man to dart
      his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes.
      Or, if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that,
      yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on
      his underlings to the attack. But be all this as it may, certain it is,
      that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in
      him, Ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one
      only and all-engrossing object of hunting the White Whale. Had any one
      of his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking
      in him then, how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have
      wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man! They were bent on
      profitable cruises, the profit to be counted down in dollars from the
      mint. He was intent on an audacious, immitigable, and supernatural
      revenge.
      
      Here, then, was this grey-headed, ungodly old man, chasing with curses
      a Job’s whale round the world, at the head of a crew, too, chiefly made
      up of mongrel renegades, and castaways, and cannibals—morally enfeebled
      also, by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or right-mindedness in
      Starbuck, the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in
      Stubb, and the pervading mediocrity in Flask. Such a crew, so
      officered, seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality
      to help him to his monomaniac revenge. How it was that they so
      aboundingly responded to the old man’s ire—by what evil magic their
      souls were possessed, that at times his hate seemed almost theirs; the
      White Whale as much their insufferable foe as his; how all this came to
      be—what the White Whale was to them, or how to their unconscious
      understandings, also, in some dim, unsuspected way, he might have
      seemed the gliding great demon of the seas of life,—all this to
      explain, would be to dive deeper than Ishmael can go. The subterranean
      miner that works in us all, how can one tell whither leads his shaft by
      the ever shifting, muffled sound of his pick? Who does not feel the
      irresistible arm drag? What skiff in tow of a seventy-four can stand
      still? For one, I gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the
      place; but while yet all a-rush to encounter the whale, could see
      naught in that brute but the deadliest ill.
      
      
      CHAPTER 42. The Whiteness of the Whale.
      
      What the white whale was to Ahab, has been hinted; what, at times, he
      was to me, as yet remains unsaid.
      
      Aside from those more obvious considerations touching Moby Dick, which
      could not but occasionally awaken in any man’s soul some alarm, there
      was another thought, or rather vague, nameless horror concerning him,
      which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest;
      and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it, that I almost
      despair of putting it in a comprehensible form. It was the whiteness of
      the whale that above all things appalled me. But how can I hope to
      explain myself here; and yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself I
      must, else all these chapters might be naught.
      
      Though in many natural objects, whiteness refiningly enhances beauty,
      as if imparting some special virtue of its own, as in marbles,
      japonicas, and pearls; and though various nations have in some way
      recognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue; even the barbaric,
      grand old kings of Pegu placing the title “Lord of the White Elephants”
      above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion; and the
      modern kings of Siam unfurling the same snow-white quadruped in the
      royal standard; and the Hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a
      snow-white charger; and the great Austrian Empire, Cæsarian, heir to
      overlording Rome, having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue;
      and though this pre-eminence in it applies to the human race itself,
      giving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe; and
      though, besides, all this, whiteness has been even made significant of
      gladness, for among the Romans a white stone marked a joyful day; and
      though in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings, this same hue is
      made the emblem of many touching, noble things—the innocence of brides,
      the benignity of age; though among the Red Men of America the giving of
      the white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of honor; though in
      many climes, whiteness typifies the majesty of Justice in the ermine of
      the Judge, and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn
      by milk-white steeds; though even in the higher mysteries of the most
      august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness
      and power; by the Persian fire worshippers, the white forked flame
      being held the holiest on the altar; and in the Greek mythologies,
      Great Jove himself being made incarnate in a snow-white bull; and
      though to the noble Iroquois, the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred
      White Dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology, that
      spotless, faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send
      to the Great Spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity; and
      though directly from the Latin word for white, all Christian priests
      derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture, the alb or tunic,
      worn beneath the cassock; and though among the holy pomps of the Romish
      faith, white is specially employed in the celebration of the Passion of
      our Lord; though in the Vision of St. John, white robes are given to
      the redeemed, and the four-and-twenty elders stand clothed in white
      before the great white throne, and the Holy One that sitteth there
      white like wool; yet for all these accumulated associations, with
      whatever is sweet, and honorable, and sublime, there yet lurks an
      elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue, which strikes more
      of panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood.
      
      This elusive quality it is, which causes the thought of whiteness, when
      divorced from more kindly associations, and coupled with any object
      terrible in itself, to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds.
      Witness the white bear of the poles, and the white shark of the
      tropics; what but their smooth, flaky whiteness makes them the
      transcendent horrors they are? That ghastly whiteness it is which
      imparts such an abhorrent mildness, even more loathsome than terrific,
      to the dumb gloating of their aspect. So that not the fierce-fanged
      tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the white-shrouded
      bear or shark.*
      
      *With reference to the Polar bear, it may possibly be urged by him who
      would fain go still deeper into this matter, that it is not the
      whiteness, separately regarded, which heightens the intolerable
      hideousness of that brute; for, analysed, that heightened hideousness,
      it might be said, only rises from the circumstance, that the
      irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the
      fleece of celestial innocence and love; and hence, by bringing together
      two such opposite emotions in our minds, the Polar bear frightens us
      with so unnatural a contrast. But even assuming all this to be true;
      yet, were it not for the whiteness, you would not have that intensified
      terror.
      
      As for the white shark, the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that
      creature, when beheld in his ordinary moods, strangely tallies with the
      same quality in the Polar quadruped. This peculiarity is most vividly
      hit by the French in the name they bestow upon that fish. The Romish
      mass for the dead begins with “Requiem eternam” (eternal rest), whence
      _Requiem_ denominating the mass itself, and any other funeral music.
      Now, in allusion to the white, silent stillness of death in this shark,
      and the mild deadliness of his habits, the French call him _Requin_.
      
      Bethink thee of the albatross, whence come those clouds of spiritual
      wonderment and pale dread, in which that white phantom sails in all
      imaginations? Not Coleridge first threw that spell; but God’s great,
      unflattering laureate, Nature.*
      
      *I remember the first albatross I ever saw. It was during a prolonged
      gale, in waters hard upon the Antarctic seas. From my forenoon watch
      below, I ascended to the overclouded deck; and there, dashed upon the
      main hatches, I saw a regal, feathery thing of unspotted whiteness, and
      with a hooked, Roman bill sublime. At intervals, it arched forth its
      vast archangel wings, as if to embrace some holy ark. Wondrous
      flutterings and throbbings shook it. Though bodily unharmed, it uttered
      cries, as some king’s ghost in supernatural distress. Through its
      inexpressible, strange eyes, methought I peeped to secrets which took
      hold of God. As Abraham before the angels, I bowed myself; the white
      thing was so white, its wings so wide, and in those for ever exiled
      waters, I had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of
      towns. Long I gazed at that prodigy of plumage. I cannot tell, can only
      hint, the things that darted through me then. But at last I awoke; and
      turning, asked a sailor what bird was this. A goney, he replied. Goney!
      never had heard that name before; is it conceivable that this glorious
      thing is utterly unknown to men ashore! never! But some time after, I
      learned that goney was some seaman’s name for albatross. So that by no
      possibility could Coleridge’s wild Rhyme have had aught to do with
      those mystical impressions which were mine, when I saw that bird upon
      our deck. For neither had I then read the Rhyme, nor knew the bird to
      be an albatross. Yet, in saying this, I do but indirectly burnish a
      little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet.
      
      I assert, then, that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird
      chiefly lurks the secret of the spell; a truth the more evinced in
      this, that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey
      albatrosses; and these I have frequently seen, but never with such
      emotions as when I beheld the Antarctic fowl.
      
      But how had the mystic thing been caught? Whisper it not, and I will
      tell; with a treacherous hook and line, as the fowl floated on the sea.
      At last the Captain made a postman of it; tying a lettered, leathern
      tally round its neck, with the ship’s time and place; and then letting
      it escape. But I doubt not, that leathern tally, meant for man, was
      taken off in Heaven, when the white fowl flew to join the wing-folding,
      the invoking, and adoring cherubim!
      
      Most famous in our Western annals and Indian traditions is that of the
      White Steed of the Prairies; a magnificent milk-white charger,
      large-eyed, small-headed, bluff-chested, and with the dignity of a
      thousand monarchs in his lofty, overscorning carriage. He was the
      elected Xerxes of vast herds of wild horses, whose pastures in those
      days were only fenced by the Rocky Mountains and the Alleghanies. At
      their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which
      every evening leads on the hosts of light. The flashing cascade of his
      mane, the curving comet of his tail, invested him with housings more
      resplendent than gold and silver-beaters could have furnished him. A
      most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen, western
      world, which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the
      glories of those primeval times when Adam walked majestic as a god,
      bluff-browed and fearless as this mighty steed. Whether marching amid
      his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly
      streamed it over the plains, like an Ohio; or whether with his
      circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon, the White
      Steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through
      his cool milkiness; in whatever aspect he presented himself, always to
      the bravest Indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe.
      Nor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this
      noble horse, that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly, which so
      clothed him with divineness; and that this divineness had that in it
      which, though commanding worship, at the same time enforced a certain
      nameless terror.
      
      But there are other instances where this whiteness loses all that
      accessory and strange glory which invests it in the White Steed and
      Albatross.
      
      What is it that in the Albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks
      the eye, as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin! It is
      that whiteness which invests him, a thing expressed by the name he
      bears. The Albino is as well made as other men—has no substantive
      deformity—and yet this mere aspect of all-pervading whiteness makes him
      more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion. Why should this be
      so?
      
      Nor, in quite other aspects, does Nature in her least palpable but not
      the less malicious agencies, fail to enlist among her forces this
      crowning attribute of the terrible. From its snowy aspect, the
      gauntleted ghost of the Southern Seas has been denominated the White
      Squall. Nor, in some historic instances, has the art of human malice
      omitted so potent an auxiliary. How wildly it heightens the effect of
      that passage in Froissart, when, masked in the snowy symbol of their
      faction, the desperate White Hoods of Ghent murder their bailiff in the
      market-place!
      
      Nor, in some things, does the common, hereditary experience of all
      mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue. It
      cannot well be doubted, that the one visible quality in the aspect of
      the dead which most appals the gazer, is the marble pallor lingering
      there; as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of
      consternation in the other world, as of mortal trepidation here. And
      from that pallor of the dead, we borrow the expressive hue of the
      shroud in which we wrap them. Nor even in our superstitions do we fail
      to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms; all ghosts rising in
      a milk-white fog—Yea, while these terrors seize us, let us add, that
      even the king of terrors, when personified by the evangelist, rides on
      his pallid horse.
      
      Therefore, in his other moods, symbolize whatever grand or gracious
      thing he will by whiteness, no man can deny that in its profoundest
      idealized significance it calls up a peculiar apparition to the soul.
      
      But though without dissent this point be fixed, how is mortal man to
      account for it? To analyse it, would seem impossible. Can we, then, by
      the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of
      whiteness—though for the time either wholly or in great part stripped
      of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful,
      but nevertheless, is found to exert over us the same sorcery, however
      modified;—can we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us
      to the hidden cause we seek?
      
      Let us try. But in a matter like this, subtlety appeals to subtlety,
      and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls. And
      though, doubtless, some at least of the imaginative impressions about
      to be presented may have been shared by most men, yet few perhaps were
      entirely conscious of them at the time, and therefore may not be able
      to recall them now.
      
      Why to the man of untutored ideality, who happens to be but loosely
      acquainted with the peculiar character of the day, does the bare
      mention of Whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long, dreary,
      speechless processions of slow-pacing pilgrims, down-cast and hooded
      with new-fallen snow? Or, to the unread, unsophisticated Protestant of
      the Middle American States, why does the passing mention of a White
      Friar or a White Nun, evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul?
      
      Or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and
      kings (which will not wholly account for it) that makes the White Tower
      of London tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an
      untravelled American, than those other storied structures, its
      neighbors—the Byward Tower, or even the Bloody? And those sublimer
      towers, the White Mountains of New Hampshire, whence, in peculiar
      moods, comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare
      mention of that name, while the thought of Virginia’s Blue Ridge is
      full of a soft, dewy, distant dreaminess? Or why, irrespective of all
      latitudes and longitudes, does the name of the White Sea exert such a
      spectralness over the fancy, while that of the Yellow Sea lulls us with
      mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves,
      followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets? Or, to choose a
      wholly unsubstantial instance, purely addressed to the fancy, why, in
      reading the old fairy tales of Central Europe, does “the tall pale man”
      of the Hartz forests, whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides
      through the green of the groves—why is this phantom more terrible than
      all the whooping imps of the Blocksburg?
      
      Nor is it, altogether, the remembrance of her cathedral-toppling
      earthquakes; nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas; nor the
      tearlessness of arid skies that never rain; nor the sight of her wide
      field of leaning spires, wrenched cope-stones, and crosses all adroop
      (like canted yards of anchored fleets); and her suburban avenues of
      house-walls lying over upon each other, as a tossed pack of cards;—it
      is not these things alone which make tearless Lima, the strangest,
      saddest city thou can’st see. For Lima has taken the white veil; and
      there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe. Old as Pizarro,
      this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new; admits not the cheerful
      greenness of complete decay; spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid
      pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions.
      
      I know that, to the common apprehension, this phenomenon of whiteness
      is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of
      objects otherwise terrible; nor to the unimaginative mind is there
      aught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind
      almost solely consists in this one phenomenon, especially when
      exhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or
      universality. What I mean by these two statements may perhaps be
      respectively elucidated by the following examples.
      
      First: The mariner, when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands, if
      by night he hear the roar of breakers, starts to vigilance, and feels
      just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties; but under
      precisely similar circumstances, let him be called from his hammock to
      view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whiteness—as if
      from encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming
      round him, then he feels a silent, superstitious dread; the shrouded
      phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost; in
      vain the lead assures him he is still off soundings; heart and helm
      they both go down; he never rests till blue water is under him again.
      Yet where is the mariner who will tell thee, “Sir, it was not so much
      the fear of striking hidden rocks, as the fear of that hideous
      whiteness that so stirred me?”
      
      Second: To the native Indian of Peru, the continual sight of the
      snow-howdahed Andes conveys naught of dread, except, perhaps, in the
      mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast
      altitudes, and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to
      lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes. Much the same is it with the
      backwoodsman of the West, who with comparative indifference views an
      unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow, no shadow of tree or twig
      to break the fixed trance of whiteness. Not so the sailor, beholding
      the scenery of the Antarctic seas; where at times, by some infernal
      trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air, he, shivering and
      half shipwrecked, instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his
      misery, views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with
      its lean ice monuments and splintered crosses.
      
      But thou sayest, methinks that white-lead chapter about whiteness is
      but a white flag hung out from a craven soul; thou surrenderest to a
      hypo, Ishmael.
      
      Tell me, why this strong young colt, foaled in some peaceful valley of
      Vermont, far removed from all beasts of prey—why is it that upon the
      sunniest day, if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him, so that
      he cannot even see it, but only smells its wild animal muskiness—why
      will he start, snort, and with bursting eyes paw the ground in
      phrensies of affright? There is no remembrance in him of any gorings of
      wild creatures in his green northern home, so that the strange
      muskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the
      experience of former perils; for what knows he, this New England colt,
      of the black bisons of distant Oregon?
      
      No: but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute, the instinct of the
      knowledge of the demonism in the world. Though thousands of miles from
      Oregon, still when he smells that savage musk, the rending, goring
      bison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the
      prairies, which this instant they may be trampling into dust.
      
      Thus, then, the muffled rollings of a milky sea; the bleak rustlings of
      the festooned frosts of mountains; the desolate shiftings of the
      windrowed snows of prairies; all these, to Ishmael, are as the shaking
      of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt!
      
      Though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic
      sign gives forth such hints; yet with me, as with the colt, somewhere
      those things must exist. Though in many of its aspects this visible
      world seems formed in love, the invisible spheres were formed in
      fright.
      
      But not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness, and
      learned why it appeals with such power to the soul; and more strange
      and far more portentous—why, as we have seen, it is at once the most
      meaning symbol of spiritual things, nay, the very veil of the
      Christian’s Deity; and yet should be as it is, the intensifying agent
      in things the most appalling to mankind.
      
      Is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids
      and immensities of the universe, and thus stabs us from behind with the
      thought of annihilation, when beholding the white depths of the milky
      way? Or is it, that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as
      the visible absence of colour; and at the same time the concrete of all
      colours; is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness,
      full of meaning, in a wide landscape of snows—a colourless, all-colour
      of atheism from which we shrink? And when we consider that other theory
      of the natural philosophers, that all other earthly hues—every stately
      or lovely emblazoning—the sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods; yea,
      and the gilded velvets of butterflies, and the butterfly cheeks of
      young girls; all these are but subtile deceits, not actually inherent
      in substances, but only laid on from without; so that all deified
      Nature absolutely paints like the harlot, whose allurements cover
      nothing but the charnel-house within; and when we proceed further, and
      consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her
      hues, the great principle of light, for ever remains white or colorless
      in itself, and if operating without medium upon matter, would touch all
      objects, even tulips and roses, with its own blank tinge—pondering all
      this, the palsied universe lies before us a leper; and like wilful
      travellers in Lapland, who refuse to wear coloured and colouring
      glasses upon their eyes, so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at
      the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him. And
      of all these things the Albino whale was the symbol. Wonder ye then at
      the fiery hunt?
      
      
      CHAPTER 43. Hark!
      
      “HIST! Did you hear that noise, Cabaco?”
      
      It was the middle-watch: a fair moonlight; the seamen were standing in
      a cordon, extending from one of the fresh-water butts in the waist, to
      the scuttle-butt near the taffrail. In this manner, they passed the
      buckets to fill the scuttle-butt. Standing, for the most part, on the
      hallowed precincts of the quarter-deck, they were careful not to speak
      or rustle their feet. From hand to hand, the buckets went in the
      deepest silence, only broken by the occasional flap of a sail, and the
      steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel.
      
      It was in the midst of this repose, that Archy, one of the cordon,
      whose post was near the after-hatches, whispered to his neighbor, a
      Cholo, the words above.
      
      “Hist! did you hear that noise, Cabaco?”
      
      “Take the bucket, will ye, Archy? what noise d’ye mean?”
      
      “There it is again—under the hatches—don’t you hear it—a cough—it
      sounded like a cough.”
      
      “Cough be damned! Pass along that return bucket.”
      
      “There again—there it is!—it sounds like two or three sleepers turning
      over, now!”
      
      “Caramba! have done, shipmate, will ye? It’s the three soaked biscuits
      ye eat for supper turning over inside of ye—nothing else. Look to the
      bucket!”
      
      “Say what ye will, shipmate; I’ve sharp ears.”
      
      “Aye, you are the chap, ain’t ye, that heard the hum of the old
      Quakeress’s knitting-needles fifty miles at sea from Nantucket; you’re
      the chap.”
      
      “Grin away; we’ll see what turns up. Hark ye, Cabaco, there is somebody
      down in the after-hold that has not yet been seen on deck; and I
      suspect our old Mogul knows something of it too. I heard Stubb tell
      Flask, one morning watch, that there was something of that sort in the
      wind.”
      
      “Tish! the bucket!”
      
      
      CHAPTER 44. The Chart.
      
      Had you followed Captain Ahab down into his cabin after the squall that
      took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his
      purpose with his crew, you would have seen him go to a locker in the
      transom, and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea
      charts, spread them before him on his screwed-down table. Then seating
      himself before it, you would have seen him intently study the various
      lines and shadings which there met his eye; and with slow but steady
      pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank. At
      intervals, he would refer to piles of old log-books beside him, wherein
      were set down the seasons and places in which, on various former
      voyages of various ships, sperm whales had been captured or seen.
      
      While thus employed, the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his
      head, continually rocked with the motion of the ship, and for ever
      threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow, till
      it almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and
      courses on the wrinkled charts, some invisible pencil was also tracing
      lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead.
      
      But it was not this night in particular that, in the solitude of his
      cabin, Ahab thus pondered over his charts. Almost every night they were
      brought out; almost every night some pencil marks were effaced, and
      others were substituted. For with the charts of all four oceans before
      him, Ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies, with a view to
      the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul.
      
      Now, to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans,
      it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary
      creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet. But not so did it seem
      to Ahab, who knew the sets of all tides and currents; and thereby
      calculating the driftings of the sperm whale’s food; and, also, calling
      to mind the regular, ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular
      latitudes; could arrive at reasonable surmises, almost approaching to
      certainties, concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that
      ground in search of his prey.
      
      So assured, indeed, is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the
      sperm whale’s resorting to given waters, that many hunters believe
      that, could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world;
      were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully
      collated, then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to
      correspond in invariability to those of the herring-shoals or the
      flights of swallows. On this hint, attempts have been made to construct
      elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale.*
      
      
        *Since the above was written, the statement is happily borne out by
        an official circular, issued by Lieutenant Maury, of the National
        Observatory, Washington, April 16th, 1851. By that circular, it
        appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion; and
        portions of it are presented in the circular. “This chart divides the
        ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of
        longitude; perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve
        columns for the twelve months; and horizontally through each of which
        districts are three lines; one to show the number of days that have
        been spent in each month in every district, and the two others to
        show the number of days in which whales, sperm or right, have been
        seen.”
      
      
      
      
      Besides, when making a passage from one feeding-ground to another, the
      sperm whales, guided by some infallible instinct—say, rather, secret
      intelligence from the Deity—mostly swim in _veins_, as they are called;
      continuing their way along a given ocean-line with such undeviating
      exactitude, that no ship ever sailed her course, by any chart, with one
      tithe of such marvellous precision. Though, in these cases, the
      direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyor’s parallel,
      and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own
      unavoidable, straight wake, yet the arbitrary _vein_ in which at these
      times he is said to swim, generally embraces some few miles in width
      (more or less, as the vein is presumed to expand or contract); but
      never exceeds the visual sweep from the whale-ship’s mast-heads, when
      circumspectly gliding along this magic zone. The sum is, that at
      particular seasons within that breadth and along that path, migrating
      whales may with great confidence be looked for.
      
      And hence not only at substantiated times, upon well known separate
      feeding-grounds, could Ahab hope to encounter his prey; but in crossing
      the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could, by his
      art, so place and time himself on his way, as even then not to be
      wholly without prospect of a meeting.
      
      There was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his
      delirious but still methodical scheme. But not so in the reality,
      perhaps. Though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons
      for particular grounds, yet in general you cannot conclude that the
      herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year,
      say, will turn out to be identically the same with those that were
      found there the preceding season; though there are peculiar and
      unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true. In
      general, the same remark, only within a less wide limit, applies to the
      solitaries and hermits among the matured, aged sperm whales. So that
      though Moby Dick had in a former year been seen, for example, on what
      is called the Seychelle ground in the Indian ocean, or Volcano Bay on
      the Japanese Coast; yet it did not follow, that were the Pequod to
      visit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season, she
      would infallibly encounter him there. So, too, with some other feeding
      grounds, where he had at times revealed himself. But all these seemed
      only his casual stopping-places and ocean-inns, so to speak, not his
      places of prolonged abode. And where Ahab’s chances of accomplishing
      his object have hitherto been spoken of, allusion has only been made to
      whatever way-side, antecedent, extra prospects were his, ere a
      particular set time or place were attained, when all possibilities
      would become probabilities, and, as Ahab fondly thought, every
      possibility the next thing to a certainty. That particular set time and
      place were conjoined in the one technical phrase—the
      Season-on-the-Line. For there and then, for several consecutive years,
      Moby Dick had been periodically descried, lingering in those waters for
      awhile, as the sun, in its annual round, loiters for a predicted
      interval in any one sign of the Zodiac. There it was, too, that most of
      the deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place; there the
      waves were storied with his deeds; there also was that tragic spot
      where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his
      vengeance. But in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering
      vigilance with which Ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering
      hunt, he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one
      crowning fact above mentioned, however flattering it might be to those
      hopes; nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his
      unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest.
      
      Now, the Pequod had sailed from Nantucket at the very beginning of the
      Season-on-the-Line. No possible endeavor then could enable her
      commander to make the great passage southwards, double Cape Horn, and
      then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial
      Pacific in time to cruise there. Therefore, he must wait for the next
      ensuing season. Yet the premature hour of the Pequod’s sailing had,
      perhaps, been correctly selected by Ahab, with a view to this very
      complexion of things. Because, an interval of three hundred and
      sixty-five days and nights was before him; an interval which, instead
      of impatiently enduring ashore, he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt;
      if by chance the White Whale, spending his vacation in seas far remote
      from his periodical feeding-grounds, should turn up his wrinkled brow
      off the Persian Gulf, or in the Bengal Bay, or China Seas, or in any
      other waters haunted by his race. So that Monsoons, Pampas,
      Nor’-Westers, Harmattans, Trades; any wind but the Levanter and Simoon,
      might blow Moby Dick into the devious zig-zag world-circle of the
      Pequod’s circumnavigating wake.
      
      But granting all this; yet, regarded discreetly and coolly, seems it
      not but a mad idea, this; that in the broad boundless ocean, one
      solitary whale, even if encountered, should be thought capable of
      individual recognition from his hunter, even as a white-bearded Mufti
      in the thronged thoroughfares of Constantinople? Yes. For the peculiar
      snow-white brow of Moby Dick, and his snow-white hump, could not but be
      unmistakable. And have I not tallied the whale, Ahab would mutter to
      himself, as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he
      would throw himself back in reveries—tallied him, and shall he escape?
      His broad fins are bored, and scalloped out like a lost sheep’s ear!
      And here, his mad mind would run on in a breathless race; till a
      weariness and faintness of pondering came over him; and in the open air
      of the deck he would seek to recover his strength. Ah, God! what
      trances of torments does that man endure who is consumed with one
      unachieved revengeful desire. He sleeps with clenched hands; and wakes
      with his own bloody nails in his palms.
      
      Often, when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid
      dreams of the night, which, resuming his own intense thoughts through
      the day, carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies, and whirled them
      round and round and round in his blazing brain, till the very throbbing
      of his life-spot became insufferable anguish; and when, as was
      sometimes the case, these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up
      from its base, and a chasm seemed opening in him, from which forked
      flames and lightnings shot up, and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap
      down among them; when this hell in himself yawned beneath him, a wild
      cry would be heard through the ship; and with glaring eyes Ahab would
      burst from his state room, as though escaping from a bed that was on
      fire. Yet these, perhaps, instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms
      of some latent weakness, or fright at his own resolve, were but the
      plainest tokens of its intensity. For, at such times, crazy Ahab, the
      scheming, unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale; this Ahab
      that had gone to his hammock, was not the agent that so caused him to
      burst from it in horror again. The latter was the eternal, living
      principle or soul in him; and in sleep, being for the time dissociated
      from the characterizing mind, which at other times employed it for its
      outer vehicle or agent, it spontaneously sought escape from the
      scorching contiguity of the frantic thing, of which, for the time, it
      was no longer an integral. But as the mind does not exist unless
      leagued with the soul, therefore it must have been that, in Ahab’s
      case, yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme
      purpose; that purpose, by its own sheer inveteracy of will, forced
      itself against gods and devils into a kind of self-assumed, independent
      being of its own. Nay, could grimly live and burn, while the common
      vitality to which it was conjoined, fled horror-stricken from the
      unbidden and unfathered birth. Therefore, the tormented spirit that
      glared out of bodily eyes, when what seemed Ahab rushed from his room,
      was for the time but a vacated thing, a formless somnambulistic being,
      a ray of living light, to be sure, but without an object to colour, and
      therefore a blankness in itself. God help thee, old man, thy thoughts
      have created a creature in thee; and he whose intense thinking thus
      makes him a Prometheus; a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever; that
      vulture the very creature he creates.
      
      
      CHAPTER 45. The Affidavit.
      
      So far as what there may be of a narrative in this book; and, indeed,
      as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious
      particulars in the habits of sperm whales, the foregoing chapter, in
      its earlier part, is as important a one as will be found in this
      volume; but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and
      more familiarly enlarged upon, in order to be adequately understood,
      and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of
      the entire subject may induce in some minds, as to the natural verity
      of the main points of this affair.
      
      I care not to perform this part of my task methodically; but shall be
      content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of
      items, practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman; and from
      these citations, I take it—the conclusion aimed at will naturally
      follow of itself.
      
      First: I have personally known three instances where a whale, after
      receiving a harpoon, has effected a complete escape; and, after an
      interval (in one instance of three years), has been again struck by the
      same hand, and slain; when the two irons, both marked by the same
      private cypher, have been taken from the body. In the instance where
      three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons; and I
      think it may have been something more than that; the man who darted
      them happening, in the interval, to go in a trading ship on a voyage to
      Africa, went ashore there, joined a discovery party, and penetrated far
      into the interior, where he travelled for a period of nearly two years,
      often endangered by serpents, savages, tigers, poisonous miasmas, with
      all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of
      unknown regions. Meanwhile, the whale he had struck must also have been
      on its travels; no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe,
      brushing with its flanks all the coasts of Africa; but to no purpose.
      This man and this whale again came together, and the one vanquished the
      other. I say I, myself, have known three instances similar to this;
      that is in two of them I saw the whales struck; and, upon the second
      attack, saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them,
      afterwards taken from the dead fish. In the three-year instance, it so
      fell out that I was in the boat both times, first and last, and the
      last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the
      whale’s eye, which I had observed there three years previous. I say
      three years, but I am pretty sure it was more than that. Here are three
      instances, then, which I personally know the truth of; but I have heard
      of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there
      is no good ground to impeach.
      
      Secondly: It is well known in the Sperm Whale Fishery, however ignorant
      the world ashore may be of it, that there have been several memorable
      historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at
      distant times and places popularly cognisable. Why such a whale became
      thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily
      peculiarities as distinguished from other whales; for however peculiar
      in that respect any chance whale may be, they soon put an end to his
      peculiarities by killing him, and boiling him down into a peculiarly
      valuable oil. No: the reason was this: that from the fatal experiences
      of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about
      such a whale as there did about Rinaldo Rinaldini, insomuch that most
      fishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their
      tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea,
      without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance. Like some
      poor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible great man, they
      make distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street, lest if they
      pursued the acquaintance further, they might receive a summary thump
      for their presumption.
      
      But not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual
      celebrity—Nay, you may call it an ocean-wide renown; not only was he
      famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death,
      but he was admitted into all the rights, privileges, and distinctions
      of a name; had as much a name indeed as Cambyses or Cæsar. Was it not
      so, O Timor Tom! thou famed leviathan, scarred like an iceberg, who so
      long did’st lurk in the Oriental straits of that name, whose spout was
      oft seen from the palmy beach of Ombay? Was it not so, O New Zealand
      Jack! thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the
      vicinity of the Tattoo Land? Was it not so, O Morquan! King of Japan,
      whose lofty jet they say at times assumed the semblance of a snow-white
      cross against the sky? Was it not so, O Don Miguel! thou Chilian whale,
      marked like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back! In
      plain prose, here are four whales as well known to the students of
      Cetacean History as Marius or Sylla to the classic scholar.
      
      But this is not all. New Zealand Tom and Don Miguel, after at various
      times creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels, were
      finally gone in quest of, systematically hunted out, chased and killed
      by valiant whaling captains, who heaved up their anchors with that
      express object as much in view, as in setting out through the
      Narragansett Woods, Captain Butler of old had it in his mind to capture
      that notorious murderous savage Annawon, the headmost warrior of the
      Indian King Philip.
      
      I do not know where I can find a better place than just here, to make
      mention of one or two other things, which to me seem important, as in
      printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the
      whole story of the White Whale, more especially the catastrophe. For
      this is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires full
      as much bolstering as error. So ignorant are most landsmen of some of
      the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world, that without some
      hints touching the plain facts, historical and otherwise, of the
      fishery, they might scout at Moby Dick as a monstrous fable, or still
      worse and more detestable, a hideous and intolerable allegory.
      
      First: Though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general
      perils of the grand fishery, yet they have nothing like a fixed, vivid
      conception of those perils, and the frequency with which they recur.
      One reason perhaps is, that not one in fifty of the actual disasters
      and deaths by casualties in the fishery, ever finds a public record at
      home, however transient and immediately forgotten that record. Do you
      suppose that that poor fellow there, who this moment perhaps caught by
      the whale-line off the coast of New Guinea, is being carried down to
      the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathan—do you suppose that
      that poor fellow’s name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will
      read to-morrow at your breakfast? No: because the mails are very
      irregular between here and New Guinea. In fact, did you ever hear what
      might be called regular news direct or indirect from New Guinea? Yet I
      tell you that upon one particular voyage which I made to the Pacific,
      among many others we spoke thirty different ships, every one of which
      had had a death by a whale, some of them more than one, and three that
      had each lost a boat’s crew. For God’s sake, be economical with your
      lamps and candles! not a gallon you burn, but at least one drop of
      man’s blood was spilled for it.
      
      Secondly: People ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale
      is an enormous creature of enormous power; but I have ever found that
      when narrating to them some specific example of this two-fold
      enormousness, they have significantly complimented me upon my
      facetiousness; when, I declare upon my soul, I had no more idea of
      being facetious than Moses, when he wrote the history of the plagues of
      Egypt.
      
      But fortunately the special point I here seek can be established upon
      testimony entirely independent of my own. That point is this: The Sperm
      Whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful, knowing, and judiciously
      malicious, as with direct aforethought to stave in, utterly destroy,
      and sink a large ship; and what is more, the Sperm Whale _has_ done it.
      
      First: In the year 1820 the ship Essex, Captain Pollard, of Nantucket,
      was cruising in the Pacific Ocean. One day she saw spouts, lowered her
      boats, and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales. Ere long, several of
      the whales were wounded; when, suddenly, a very large whale escaping
      from the boats, issued from the shoal, and bore directly down upon the
      ship. Dashing his forehead against her hull, he so stove her in, that
      in less than “ten minutes” she settled down and fell over. Not a
      surviving plank of her has been seen since. After the severest
      exposure, part of the crew reached the land in their boats. Being
      returned home at last, Captain Pollard once more sailed for the Pacific
      in command of another ship, but the gods shipwrecked him again upon
      unknown rocks and breakers; for the second time his ship was utterly
      lost, and forthwith forswearing the sea, he has never tempted it since.
      At this day Captain Pollard is a resident of Nantucket. I have seen
      Owen Chace, who was chief mate of the Essex at the time of the tragedy;
      I have read his plain and faithful narrative; I have conversed with his
      son; and all this within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe.*
      
      *The following are extracts from Chace’s narrative: “Every fact seemed
      to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which
      directed his operations; he made two several attacks upon the ship, at
      a short interval between them, both of which, according to their
      direction, were calculated to do us the most injury, by being made
      ahead, and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the
      shock; to effect which, the exact manœuvres which he made were
      necessary. His aspect was most horrible, and such as indicated
      resentment and fury. He came directly from the shoal which we had just
      before entered, and in which we had struck three of his companions, as
      if fired with revenge for their sufferings.” Again: “At all events, the
      whole circumstances taken together, all happening before my own eyes,
      and producing, at the time, impressions in my mind of decided,
      calculating mischief, on the part of the whale (many of which
      impressions I cannot now recall), induce me to be satisfied that I am
      correct in my opinion.”
      
      Here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship, during a
      black night in an open boat, when almost despairing of reaching any
      hospitable shore. “The dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing; the
      fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest, or dashed upon
      hidden rocks, with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful
      contemplation, seemed scarcely entitled to a moment’s thought; the
      dismal looking wreck, and _the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale_,
      wholly engrossed my reflections, until day again made its appearance.”
      
      In another place—p. 45,—he speaks of “_the mysterious and mortal attack
      of the animal_.”
      
      Secondly: The ship Union, also of Nantucket, was in the year 1807
      totally lost off the Azores by a similar onset, but the authentic
      particulars of this catastrophe I have never chanced to encounter,
      though from the whale hunters I have now and then heard casual
      allusions to it.
      
      Thirdly: Some eighteen or twenty years ago Commodore J——, then
      commanding an American sloop-of-war of the first class, happened to be
      dining with a party of whaling captains, on board a Nantucket ship in
      the harbor of Oahu, Sandwich Islands. Conversation turning upon whales,
      the Commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength
      ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present. He peremptorily
      denied for example, that any whale could so smite his stout
      sloop-of-war as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful. Very
      good; but there is more coming. Some weeks after, the Commodore set
      sail in this impregnable craft for Valparaiso. But he was stopped on
      the way by a portly sperm whale, that begged a few moments’
      confidential business with him. That business consisted in fetching the
      Commodore’s craft such a thwack, that with all his pumps going he made
      straight for the nearest port to heave down and repair. I am not
      superstitious, but I consider the Commodore’s interview with that whale
      as providential. Was not Saul of Tarsus converted from unbelief by a
      similar fright? I tell you, the sperm whale will stand no nonsense.
      
      I will now refer you to Langsdorff’s Voyages for a little circumstance
      in point, peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof. Langsdorff, you
      must know by the way, was attached to the Russian Admiral Krusenstern’s
      famous Discovery Expedition in the beginning of the present century.
      Captain Langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter:
      
      “By the thirteenth of May our ship was ready to sail, and the next day
      we were out in the open sea, on our way to Ochotsh. The weather was
      very clear and fine, but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to
      keep on our fur clothing. For some days we had very little wind; it was
      not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up.
      An uncommon large whale, the body of which was larger than the ship
      itself, lay almost at the surface of the water, but was not perceived
      by any one on board till the moment when the ship, which was in full
      sail, was almost upon him, so that it was impossible to prevent its
      striking against him. We were thus placed in the most imminent danger,
      as this gigantic creature, setting up its back, raised the ship three
      feet at least out of the water. The masts reeled, and the sails fell
      altogether, while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck,
      concluding that we had struck upon some rock; instead of this we saw
      the monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity. Captain
      D’Wolf applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the
      vessel had received any damage from the shock, but we found that very
      happily it had escaped entirely uninjured.”
      
      Now, the Captain D’Wolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in
      question, is a New Englander, who, after a long life of unusual
      adventures as a sea-captain, this day resides in the village of
      Dorchester near Boston. I have the honor of being a nephew of his. I
      have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in Langsdorff.
      He substantiates every word. The ship, however, was by no means a large
      one: a Russian craft built on the Siberian coast, and purchased by my
      uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home.
      
      In that up and down manly book of old-fashioned adventure, so full,
      too, of honest wonders—the voyage of Lionel Wafer, one of ancient
      Dampier’s old chums—I found a little matter set down so like that just
      quoted from Langsdorff, that I cannot forbear inserting it here for a
      corroborative example, if such be needed.
      
      Lionel, it seems, was on his way to “John Ferdinando,” as he calls the
      modern Juan Fernandes. “In our way thither,” he says, “about four
      o’clock in the morning, when we were about one hundred and fifty
      leagues from the Main of America, our ship felt a terrible shock, which
      put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where
      they were or what to think; but every one began to prepare for death.
      And, indeed, the shock was so sudden and violent, that we took it for
      granted the ship had struck against a rock; but when the amazement was
      a little over, we cast the lead, and sounded, but found no ground. * *
      * * * The suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their
      carriages, and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks.
      Captain Davis, who lay with his head on a gun, was thrown out of his
      cabin!” Lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake, and
      seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a great
      earthquake, somewhere about that time, did actually do great mischief
      along the Spanish land. But I should not much wonder if, in the
      darkness of that early hour of the morning, the shock was after all
      caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath.
      
      I might proceed with several more examples, one way or another known to
      me, of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale. In more
      than one instance, he has been known, not only to chase the assailing
      boats back to their ships, but to pursue the ship itself, and long
      withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks. The English ship
      Pusie Hall can tell a story on that head; and, as for his strength, let
      me say, that there have been examples where the lines attached to a
      running sperm whale have, in a calm, been transferred to the ship, and
      secured there; the whale towing her great hull through the water, as a
      horse walks off with a cart. Again, it is very often observed that, if
      the sperm whale, once struck, is allowed time to rally, he then acts,
      not so often with blind rage, as with wilful, deliberate designs of
      destruction to his pursuers; nor is it without conveying some eloquent
      indication of his character, that upon being attacked he will
      frequently open his mouth, and retain it in that dread expansion for
      several consecutive minutes. But I must be content with only one more
      and a concluding illustration; a remarkable and most significant one,
      by which you will not fail to see, that not only is the most marvellous
      event in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day, but
      that these marvels (like all marvels) are mere repetitions of the ages;
      so that for the millionth time we say amen with Solomon—Verily there is
      nothing new under the sun.
      
      In the sixth Christian century lived Procopius, a Christian magistrate
      of Constantinople, in the days when Justinian was Emperor and
      Belisarius general. As many know, he wrote the history of his own
      times, a work every way of uncommon value. By the best authorities, he
      has always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating
      historian, except in some one or two particulars, not at all affecting
      the matter presently to be mentioned.
      
      Now, in this history of his, Procopius mentions that, during the term
      of his prefecture at Constantinople, a great sea-monster was captured
      in the neighboring Propontis, or Sea of Marmora, after having destroyed
      vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty
      years. A fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be
      gainsaid. Nor is there any reason it should be. Of what precise species
      this sea-monster was, is not mentioned. But as he destroyed ships, as
      well as for other reasons, he must have been a whale; and I am strongly
      inclined to think a sperm whale. And I will tell you why. For a long
      time I fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the
      Mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it. Even now I am
      certain that those seas are not, and perhaps never can be, in the
      present constitution of things, a place for his habitual gregarious
      resort. But further investigations have recently proved to me, that in
      modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the
      sperm whale in the Mediterranean. I am told, on good authority, that on
      the Barbary coast, a Commodore Davis of the British navy found the
      skeleton of a sperm whale. Now, as a vessel of war readily passes
      through the Dardanelles, hence a sperm whale could, by the same route,
      pass out of the Mediterranean into the Propontis.
      
      In the Propontis, as far as I can learn, none of that peculiar
      substance called _brit_ is to be found, the aliment of the right whale.
      But I have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm
      whale—squid or cuttle-fish—lurks at the bottom of that sea, because
      large creatures, but by no means the largest of that sort, have been
      found at its surface. If, then, you properly put these statements
      together, and reason upon them a bit, you will clearly perceive that,
      according to all human reasoning, Procopius’s sea-monster, that for
      half a century stove the ships of a Roman Emperor, must in all
      probability have been a sperm whale.
      
      
      CHAPTER 46. Surmises.
      
      Though, consumed with the hot fire of his purpose, Ahab in all his
      thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of Moby
      Dick; though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that
      one passion; nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and
      long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whaleman’s ways, altogether
      to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage. Or at least if
      this were otherwise, there were not wanting other motives much more
      influential with him. It would be refining too much, perhaps, even
      considering his monomania, to hint that his vindictiveness towards the
      White Whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all
      sperm whales, and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he
      multiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would
      prove to be the hated one he hunted. But if such an hypothesis be
      indeed exceptionable, there were still additional considerations which,
      though not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling
      passion, yet were by no means incapable of swaying him.
      
      To accomplish his object Ahab must use tools; and of all tools used in
      the shadow of the moon, men are most apt to get out of order. He knew,
      for example, that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was
      over Starbuck, yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual
      man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual
      mastership; for to the purely spiritual, the intellectual but stand in
      a sort of corporeal relation. Starbuck’s body and Starbuck’s coerced
      will were Ahab’s, so long as Ahab kept his magnet at Starbuck’s brain;
      still he knew that for all this the chief mate, in his soul, abhorred
      his captain’s quest, and could he, would joyfully disintegrate himself
      from it, or even frustrate it. It might be that a long interval would
      elapse ere the White Whale was seen. During that long interval Starbuck
      would ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his
      captain’s leadership, unless some ordinary, prudential, circumstantial
      influences were brought to bear upon him. Not only that, but the subtle
      insanity of Ahab respecting Moby Dick was noways more significantly
      manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing
      that, for the present, the hunt should in some way be stripped of that
      strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it; that the
      full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure
      background (for few men’s courage is proof against protracted
      meditation unrelieved by action); that when they stood their long night
      watches, his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of
      than Moby Dick. For however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had
      hailed the announcement of his quest; yet all sailors of all sorts are
      more or less capricious and unreliable—they live in the varying outer
      weather, and they inhale its fickleness—and when retained for any
      object remote and blank in the pursuit, however promissory of life and
      passion in the end, it is above all things requisite that temporary
      interests and employments should intervene and hold them healthily
      suspended for the final dash.
      
      Nor was Ahab unmindful of another thing. In times of strong emotion
      mankind disdain all base considerations; but such times are evanescent.
      The permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man, thought
      Ahab, is sordidness. Granting that the White Whale fully incites the
      hearts of this my savage crew, and playing round their savageness even
      breeds a certain generous knight-errantism in them, still, while for
      the love of it they give chase to Moby Dick, they must also have food
      for their more common, daily appetites. For even the high lifted and
      chivalric Crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two
      thousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre, without
      committing burglaries, picking pockets, and gaining other pious
      perquisites by the way. Had they been strictly held to their one final
      and romantic object—that final and romantic object, too many would have
      turned from in disgust. I will not strip these men, thought Ahab, of
      all hopes of cash—aye, cash. They may scorn cash now; but let some
      months go by, and no perspective promise of it to them, and then this
      same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them, this same cash would
      soon cashier Ahab.
      
      Nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related
      to Ahab personally. Having impulsively, it is probable, and perhaps
      somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the
      Pequod’s voyage, Ahab was now entirely conscious that, in so doing, he
      had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of
      usurpation; and with perfect impunity, both moral and legal, his crew
      if so disposed, and to that end competent, could refuse all further
      obedience to him, and even violently wrest from him the command. From
      even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation, and the possible
      consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground, Ahab must
      of course have been most anxious to protect himself. That protection
      could only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand,
      backed by a heedful, closely calculating attention to every minute
      atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be
      subjected to.
      
      For all these reasons then, and others perhaps too analytic to be
      verbally developed here, Ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good
      degree continue true to the natural, nominal purpose of the Pequod’s
      voyage; observe all customary usages; and not only that, but force
      himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general
      pursuit of his profession.
      
      Be all this as it may, his voice was now often heard hailing the three
      mast-heads and admonishing them to keep a bright look-out, and not omit
      reporting even a porpoise. This vigilance was not long without reward.
      
      
      CHAPTER 47. The Mat-Maker.
      
      It was a cloudy, sultry afternoon; the seamen were lazily lounging
      about the decks, or vacantly gazing over into the lead-coloured waters.
      Queequeg and I were mildly employed weaving what is called a sword-mat,
      for an additional lashing to our boat. So still and subdued and yet
      somehow preluding was all the scene, and such an incantation of reverie
      lurked in the air, that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own
      invisible self.
      
      I was the attendant or page of Queequeg, while busy at the mat. As I
      kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the
      long yarns of the warp, using my own hand for the shuttle, and as
      Queequeg, standing sideways, ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword
      between the threads, and idly looking off upon the water, carelessly
      and unthinkingly drove home every yarn: I say so strange a dreaminess
      did there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea, only
      broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword, that it seemed as
      if this were the Loom of Time, and I myself were a shuttle mechanically
      weaving and weaving away at the Fates. There lay the fixed threads of
      the warp subject to but one single, ever returning, unchanging
      vibration, and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise
      interblending of other threads with its own. This warp seemed
      necessity; and here, thought I, with my own hand I ply my own shuttle
      and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads. Meantime,
      Queequeg’s impulsive, indifferent sword, sometimes hitting the woof
      slantingly, or crookedly, or strongly, or weakly, as the case might be;
      and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding
      contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric; this savage’s
      sword, thought I, which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and
      woof; this easy, indifferent sword must be chance—aye, chance, free
      will, and necessity—nowise incompatible—all interweavingly working
      together. The straight warp of necessity, not to be swerved from its
      ultimate course—its every alternating vibration, indeed, only tending
      to that; free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads;
      and chance, though restrained in its play within the right lines of
      necessity, and sideways in its motions directed by free will, though
      thus prescribed to by both, chance by turns rules either, and has the
      last featuring blow at events.
      
      Thus we were weaving and weaving away when I started at a sound so
      strange, long drawn, and musically wild and unearthly, that the ball of
      free will dropped from my hand, and I stood gazing up at the clouds
      whence that voice dropped like a wing. High aloft in the cross-trees
      was that mad Gay-Header, Tashtego. His body was reaching eagerly
      forward, his hand stretched out like a wand, and at brief sudden
      intervals he continued his cries. To be sure the same sound was that
      very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas, from hundreds of
      whalemen’s look-outs perched as high in the air; but from few of those
      lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous
      cadence as from Tashtego the Indian’s.
      
      As he stood hovering over you half suspended in air, so wildly and
      eagerly peering towards the horizon, you would have thought him some
      prophet or seer beholding the shadows of Fate, and by those wild cries
      announcing their coming.
      
      “There she blows! there! there! there! she blows! she blows!”
      
      “Where-away?”
      
      “On the lee-beam, about two miles off! a school of them!”
      
      Instantly all was commotion.
      
      The Sperm Whale blows as a clock ticks, with the same undeviating and
      reliable uniformity. And thereby whalemen distinguish this fish from
      other tribes of his genus.
      
      “There go flukes!” was now the cry from Tashtego; and the whales
      disappeared.
      
      “Quick, steward!” cried Ahab. “Time! time!”
      
      Dough-Boy hurried below, glanced at the watch, and reported the exact
      minute to Ahab.
      
      The ship was now kept away from the wind, and she went gently rolling
      before it. Tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to
      leeward, we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of
      our bows. For that singular craft at times evinced by the Sperm Whale
      when, sounding with his head in one direction, he nevertheless, while
      concealed beneath the surface, mills round, and swiftly swims off in
      the opposite quarter—this deceitfulness of his could not now be in
      action; for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by
      Tashtego had been in any way alarmed, or indeed knew at all of our
      vicinity. One of the men selected for shipkeepers—that is, those not
      appointed to the boats, by this time relieved the Indian at the
      main-mast head. The sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down; the
      line tubs were fixed in their places; the cranes were thrust out; the
      mainyard was backed, and the three boats swung over the sea like three
      samphire baskets over high cliffs. Outside of the bulwarks their eager
      crews with one hand clung to the rail, while one foot was expectantly
      poised on the gunwale. So look the long line of man-of-war’s men about
      to throw themselves on board an enemy’s ship.
      
      But at this critical instant a sudden exclamation was heard that took
      every eye from the whale. With a start all glared at dark Ahab, who was
      surrounded by five dusky phantoms that seemed fresh formed out of air.
      
      
      CHAPTER 48. The First Lowering.
      
      The phantoms, for so they then seemed, were flitting on the other side
      of the deck, and, with a noiseless celerity, were casting loose the
      tackles and bands of the boat which swung there. This boat had always
      been deemed one of the spare boats, though technically called the
      captain’s, on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter. The
      figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart, with one white
      tooth evilly protruding from its steel-like lips. A rumpled Chinese
      jacket of black cotton funereally invested him, with wide black
      trowsers of the same dark stuff. But strangely crowning this ebonness
      was a glistening white plaited turban, the living hair braided and
      coiled round and round upon his head. Less swart in aspect, the
      companions of this figure were of that vivid, tiger-yellow complexion
      peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the Manillas;—a race
      notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty, and by some honest white
      mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents
      on the water of the devil, their lord, whose counting-room they suppose
      to be elsewhere.
      
      While yet the wondering ship’s company were gazing upon these
      strangers, Ahab cried out to the white-turbaned old man at their head,
      “All ready there, Fedallah?”
      
      “Ready,” was the half-hissed reply.
      
      “Lower away then; d’ye hear?” shouting across the deck. “Lower away
      there, I say.”
      
      Such was the thunder of his voice, that spite of their amazement the
      men sprang over the rail; the sheaves whirled round in the blocks; with
      a wallow, the three boats dropped into the sea; while, with a
      dexterous, off-handed daring, unknown in any other vocation, the
      sailors, goat-like, leaped down the rolling ship’s side into the tossed
      boats below.
      
      Hardly had they pulled out from under the ship’s lee, when a fourth
      keel, coming from the windward side, pulled round under the stern, and
      showed the five strangers rowing Ahab, who, standing erect in the
      stern, loudly hailed Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask, to spread themselves
      widely, so as to cover a large expanse of water. But with all their
      eyes again riveted upon the swart Fedallah and his crew, the inmates of
      the other boats obeyed not the command.
      
      “Captain Ahab?—” said Starbuck.
      
      “Spread yourselves,” cried Ahab; “give way, all four boats. Thou,
      Flask, pull out more to leeward!”
      
      “Aye, aye, sir,” cheerily cried little King-Post, sweeping round his
      great steering oar. “Lay back!” addressing his crew.
      “There!—there!—there again! There she blows right ahead, boys!—lay
      back!”
      
      “Never heed yonder yellow boys, Archy.”
      
      “Oh, I don’t mind ’em, sir,” said Archy; “I knew it all before now.
      Didn’t I hear ’em in the hold? And didn’t I tell Cabaco here of it?
      What say ye, Cabaco? They are stowaways, Mr. Flask.”
      
      “Pull, pull, my fine hearts-alive; pull, my children; pull, my little
      ones,” drawlingly and soothingly sighed Stubb to his crew, some of whom
      still showed signs of uneasiness. “Why don’t you break your backbones,
      my boys? What is it you stare at? Those chaps in yonder boat? Tut! They
      are only five more hands come to help us—never mind from where—the more
      the merrier. Pull, then, do pull; never mind the brimstone—devils are
      good fellows enough. So, so; there you are now; that’s the stroke for a
      thousand pounds; that’s the stroke to sweep the stakes! Hurrah for the
      gold cup of sperm oil, my heroes! Three cheers, men—all hearts alive!
      Easy, easy; don’t be in a hurry—don’t be in a hurry. Why don’t you snap
      your oars, you rascals? Bite something, you dogs! So, so, so,
      then:—softly, softly! That’s it—that’s it! long and strong. Give way
      there, give way! The devil fetch ye, ye ragamuffin rapscallions; ye are
      all asleep. Stop snoring, ye sleepers, and pull. Pull, will ye? pull,
      can’t ye? pull, won’t ye? Why in the name of gudgeons and ginger-cakes
      don’t ye pull?—pull and break something! pull, and start your eyes out!
      Here!” whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle; “every mother’s
      son of ye draw his knife, and pull with the blade between his teeth.
      That’s it—that’s it. Now ye do something; that looks like it, my
      steel-bits. Start her—start her, my silver-spoons! Start her,
      marling-spikes!”
      
      Stubb’s exordium to his crew is given here at large, because he had
      rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general, and especially in
      inculcating the religion of rowing. But you must not suppose from this
      specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions
      with his congregation. Not at all; and therein consisted his chief
      peculiarity. He would say the most terrific things to his crew, in a
      tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury, and the fury seemed so
      calculated merely as a spice to the fun, that no oarsman could hear
      such queer invocations without pulling for dear life, and yet pulling
      for the mere joke of the thing. Besides he all the time looked so easy
      and indolent himself, so loungingly managed his steering-oar, and so
      broadly gaped—open-mouthed at times—that the mere sight of such a
      yawning commander, by sheer force of contrast, acted like a charm upon
      the crew. Then again, Stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists,
      whose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous, as to put all
      inferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them.
      
      In obedience to a sign from Ahab, Starbuck was now pulling obliquely
      across Stubb’s bow; and when for a minute or so the two boats were
      pretty near to each other, Stubb hailed the mate.
      
      “Mr. Starbuck! larboard boat there, ahoy! a word with ye, sir, if ye
      please!”
      
      “Halloa!” returned Starbuck, turning round not a single inch as he
      spoke; still earnestly but whisperingly urging his crew; his face set
      like a flint from Stubb’s.
      
      “What think ye of those yellow boys, sir!”
      
      “Smuggled on board, somehow, before the ship sailed. (Strong, strong,
      boys!)” in a whisper to his crew, then speaking out loud again: “A sad
      business, Mr. Stubb! (seethe her, seethe her, my lads!) but never mind,
      Mr. Stubb, all for the best. Let all your crew pull strong, come what
      will. (Spring, my men, spring!) There’s hogsheads of sperm ahead, Mr.
      Stubb, and that’s what ye came for. (Pull, my boys!) Sperm, sperm’s the
      play! This at least is duty; duty and profit hand in hand.”
      
      “Aye, aye, I thought as much,” soliloquized Stubb, when the boats
      diverged, “as soon as I clapt eye on ’em, I thought so. Aye, and that’s
      what he went into the after hold for, so often, as Dough-Boy long
      suspected. They were hidden down there. The White Whale’s at the bottom
      of it. Well, well, so be it! Can’t be helped! All right! Give way, men!
      It ain’t the White Whale to-day! Give way!”
      
      Now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant
      as the lowering of the boats from the deck, this had not unreasonably
      awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ship’s
      company; but Archy’s fancied discovery having some time previous got
      abroad among them, though indeed not credited then, this had in some
      small measure prepared them for the event. It took off the extreme edge
      of their wonder; and so what with all this and Stubb’s confident way of
      accounting for their appearance, they were for the time freed from
      superstitious surmisings; though the affair still left abundant room
      for all manner of wild conjectures as to dark Ahab’s precise agency in
      the matter from the beginning. For me, I silently recalled the
      mysterious shadows I had seen creeping on board the Pequod during the
      dim Nantucket dawn, as well as the enigmatical hintings of the
      unaccountable Elijah.
      
      Meantime, Ahab, out of hearing of his officers, having sided the
      furthest to windward, was still ranging ahead of the other boats; a
      circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him. Those tiger
      yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone; like five
      trip-hammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength, which
      periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst
      boiler out of a Mississippi steamer. As for Fedallah, who was seen
      pulling the harpooneer oar, he had thrown aside his black jacket, and
      displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the
      gunwale, clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery
      horizon; while at the other end of the boat Ahab, with one arm, like a
      fencer’s, thrown half backward into the air, as if to counterbalance
      any tendency to trip; Ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar
      as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the White Whale had torn him. All
      at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained
      fixed, while the boat’s five oars were seen simultaneously peaked. Boat
      and crew sat motionless on the sea. Instantly the three spread boats in
      the rear paused on their way. The whales had irregularly settled bodily
      down into the blue, thus giving no distantly discernible token of the
      movement, though from his closer vicinity Ahab had observed it.
      
      “Every man look out along his oars!” cried Starbuck. “Thou, Queequeg,
      stand up!”
      
      Nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow, the savage
      stood erect there, and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the
      spot where the chase had last been descried. Likewise upon the extreme
      stern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with
      the gunwale, Starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing
      himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft, and silently
      eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea.
      
      Not very far distant Flask’s boat was also lying breathlessly still;
      its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead, a
      stout sort of post rooted in the keel, and rising some two feet above
      the level of the stern platform. It is used for catching turns with the
      whale line. Its top is not more spacious than the palm of a man’s hand,
      and standing upon such a base as that, Flask seemed perched at the
      mast-head of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks. But little
      King-Post was small and short, and at the same time little King-Post
      was full of a large and tall ambition, so that this loggerhead
      stand-point of his did by no means satisfy King-Post.
      
      “I can’t see three seas off; tip us up an oar there, and let me on to
      that.”
      
      Upon this, Daggoo, with either hand upon the gunwale to steady his way,
      swiftly slid aft, and then erecting himself volunteered his lofty
      shoulders for a pedestal.
      
      “Good a mast-head as any, sir. Will you mount?”
      
      “That I will, and thank ye very much, my fine fellow; only I wish you
      fifty feet taller.”
      
      Whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the
      boat, the gigantic negro, stooping a little, presented his flat palm to
      Flask’s foot, and then putting Flask’s hand on his hearse-plumed head
      and bidding him spring as he himself should toss, with one dexterous
      fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders. And here was
      Flask now standing, Daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a
      breastband to lean against and steady himself by.
      
      At any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous
      habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect
      posture in his boat, even when pitched about by the most riotously
      perverse and cross-running seas. Still more strange to see him giddily
      perched upon the loggerhead itself, under such circumstances. But the
      sight of little Flask mounted upon gigantic Daggoo was yet more
      curious; for sustaining himself with a cool, indifferent, easy,
      unthought of, barbaric majesty, the noble negro to every roll of the
      sea harmoniously rolled his fine form. On his broad back, flaxen-haired
      Flask seemed a snow-flake. The bearer looked nobler than the rider.
      Though truly vivacious, tumultuous, ostentatious little Flask would now
      and then stamp with impatience; but not one added heave did he thereby
      give to the negro’s lordly chest. So have I seen Passion and Vanity
      stamping the living magnanimous earth, but the earth did not alter her
      tides and her seasons for that.
      
      Meanwhile Stubb, the third mate, betrayed no such far-gazing
      solicitudes. The whales might have made one of their regular soundings,
      not a temporary dive from mere fright; and if that were the case,
      Stubb, as his wont in such cases, it seems, was resolved to solace the
      languishing interval with his pipe. He withdrew it from his hatband,
      where he always wore it aslant like a feather. He loaded it, and rammed
      home the loading with his thumb-end; but hardly had he ignited his
      match across the rough sandpaper of his hand, when Tashtego, his
      harpooneer, whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed
      stars, suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat,
      crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry, “Down, down all, and give
      way!—there they are!”
      
      To a landsman, no whale, nor any sign of a herring, would have been
      visible at that moment; nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white
      water, and thin scattered puffs of vapor hovering over it, and
      suffusingly blowing off to leeward, like the confused scud from white
      rolling billows. The air around suddenly vibrated and tingled, as it
      were, like the air over intensely heated plates of iron. Beneath this
      atmospheric waving and curling, and partially beneath a thin layer of
      water, also, the whales were swimming. Seen in advance of all the other
      indications, the puffs of vapor they spouted, seemed their forerunning
      couriers and detached flying outriders.
      
      All four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled
      water and air. But it bade fair to outstrip them; it flew on and on, as
      a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the
      hills.
      
      “Pull, pull, my good boys,” said Starbuck, in the lowest possible but
      intensest concentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed glance
      from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed as two
      visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses. He did not say much
      to his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to him. Only the
      silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his
      peculiar whispers, now harsh with command, now soft with entreaty.
      
      How different the loud little King-Post. “Sing out and say something,
      my hearties. Roar and pull, my thunderbolts! Beach me, beach me on
      their black backs, boys; only do that for me, and I’ll sign over to you
      my Martha’s Vineyard plantation, boys; including wife and children,
      boys. Lay me on—lay me on! O Lord, Lord! but I shall go stark, staring
      mad! See! see that white water!” And so shouting, he pulled his hat
      from his head, and stamped up and down on it; then picking it up,
      flirted it far off upon the sea; and finally fell to rearing and
      plunging in the boat’s stern like a crazed colt from the prairie.
      
      “Look at that chap now,” philosophically drawled Stubb, who, with his
      unlighted short pipe, mechanically retained between his teeth, at a
      short distance, followed after—“He’s got fits, that Flask has. Fits?
      yes, give him fits—that’s the very word—pitch fits into ’em. Merrily,
      merrily, hearts-alive. Pudding for supper, you know;—merry’s the word.
      Pull, babes—pull, sucklings—pull, all. But what the devil are you
      hurrying about? Softly, softly, and steadily, my men. Only pull, and
      keep pulling; nothing more. Crack all your backbones, and bite your
      knives in two—that’s all. Take it easy—why don’t ye take it easy, I
      say, and burst all your livers and lungs!”
      
      But what it was that inscrutable Ahab said to that tiger-yellow crew of
      his—these were words best omitted here; for you live under the blessed
      light of the evangelical land. Only the infidel sharks in the audacious
      seas may give ear to such words, when, with tornado brow, and eyes of
      red murder, and foam-glued lips, Ahab leaped after his prey.
      
      Meanwhile, all the boats tore on. The repeated specific allusions of
      Flask to “that whale,” as he called the fictitious monster which he
      declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boat’s bow with its
      tail—these allusions of his were at times so vivid and life-like, that
      they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look
      over the shoulder. But this was against all rule; for the oarsmen must
      put out their eyes, and ram a skewer through their necks; usage
      pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears, and no limbs but
      arms, in these critical moments.
      
      It was a sight full of quick wonder and awe! The vast swells of the
      omnipotent sea; the surging, hollow roar they made, as they rolled
      along the eight gunwales, like gigantic bowls in a boundless
      bowling-green; the brief suspended agony of the boat, as it would tip
      for an instant on the knife-like edge of the sharper waves, that almost
      seemed threatening to cut it in two; the sudden profound dip into the
      watery glens and hollows; the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the
      top of the opposite hill; the headlong, sled-like slide down its other
      side;—all these, with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers, and
      the shuddering gasps of the oarsmen, with the wondrous sight of the
      ivory Pequod bearing down upon her boats with outstretched sails, like
      a wild hen after her screaming brood;—all this was thrilling.
      
      Not the raw recruit, marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever
      heat of his first battle; not the dead man’s ghost encountering the
      first unknown phantom in the other world;—neither of these can feel
      stranger and stronger emotions than that man does, who for the first
      time finds himself pulling into the charmed, churned circle of the
      hunted sperm whale.
      
      The dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and
      more visible, owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloud-shadows
      flung upon the sea. The jets of vapor no longer blended, but tilted
      everywhere to right and left; the whales seemed separating their wakes.
      The boats were pulled more apart; Starbuck giving chase to three whales
      running dead to leeward. Our sail was now set, and, with the still
      rising wind, we rushed along; the boat going with such madness through
      the water, that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to
      escape being torn from the row-locks.
      
      Soon we were running through a suffusing wide veil of mist; neither
      ship nor boat to be seen.
      
      “Give way, men,” whispered Starbuck, drawing still further aft the
      sheet of his sail; “there is time to kill a fish yet before the squall
      comes. There’s white water again!—close to! Spring!”
      
      Soon after, two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted
      that the other boats had got fast; but hardly were they overheard, when
      with a lightning-like hurtling whisper Starbuck said: “Stand up!” and
      Queequeg, harpoon in hand, sprang to his feet.
      
      Though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril
      so close to them ahead, yet with their eyes on the intense countenance
      of the mate in the stern of the boat, they knew that the imminent
      instant had come; they heard, too, an enormous wallowing sound as of
      fifty elephants stirring in their litter. Meanwhile the boat was still
      booming through the mist, the waves curling and hissing around us like
      the erected crests of enraged serpents.
      
      “That’s his hump. _There_, _there_, give it to him!” whispered
      Starbuck.
      
      A short rushing sound leaped out of the boat; it was the darted iron of
      Queequeg. Then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from
      astern, while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge; the sail
      collapsed and exploded; a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by;
      something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us. The whole
      crew were half suffocated as they were tossed helter-skelter into the
      white curdling cream of the squall. Squall, whale, and harpoon had all
      blended together; and the whale, merely grazed by the iron, escaped.
      
      Though completely swamped, the boat was nearly unharmed. Swimming round
      it we picked up the floating oars, and lashing them across the gunwale,
      tumbled back to our places. There we sat up to our knees in the sea,
      the water covering every rib and plank, so that to our downward gazing
      eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the
      bottom of the ocean.
      
      The wind increased to a howl; the waves dashed their bucklers together;
      the whole squall roared, forked, and crackled around us like a white
      fire upon the prairie, in which, unconsumed, we were burning; immortal
      in these jaws of death! In vain we hailed the other boats; as well roar
      to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those
      boats in that storm. Meanwhile the driving scud, rack, and mist, grew
      darker with the shadows of night; no sign of the ship could be seen.
      The rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat. The oars were
      useless as propellers, performing now the office of life-preservers.
      So, cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg, after many
      failures Starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern; then
      stretching it on a waif pole, handed it to Queequeg as the
      standard-bearer of this forlorn hope. There, then, he sat, holding up
      that imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness. There,
      then, he sat, the sign and symbol of a man without faith, hopelessly
      holding up hope in the midst of despair.
      
      Wet, drenched through, and shivering cold, despairing of ship or boat,
      we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on. The mist still spread over
      the sea, the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat.
      Suddenly Queequeg started to his feet, hollowing his hand to his ear.
      We all heard a faint creaking, as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled
      by the storm. The sound came nearer and nearer; the thick mists were
      dimly parted by a huge, vague form. Affrighted, we all sprang into the
      sea as the ship at last loomed into view, bearing right down upon us
      within a distance of not much more than its length.
      
      Floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat, as for one instant it
      tossed and gaped beneath the ship’s bows like a chip at the base of a
      cataract; and then the vast hull rolled over it, and it was seen no
      more till it came up weltering astern. Again we swam for it, were
      dashed against it by the seas, and were at last taken up and safely
      landed on board. Ere the squall came close to, the other boats had cut
      loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time. The ship
      had given us up, but was still cruising, if haply it might light upon
      some token of our perishing,—an oar or a lance pole.
      
      
      CHAPTER 49. The Hyena.
      
      There are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed
      affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast
      practical joke, though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns, and more
      than suspects that the joke is at nobody’s expense but his own.
      However, nothing dispirits, and nothing seems worth while disputing. He
      bolts down all events, all creeds, and beliefs, and persuasions, all
      hard things visible and invisible, never mind how knobby; as an ostrich
      of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints. And as for
      small difficulties and worryings, prospects of sudden disaster, peril
      of life and limb; all these, and death itself, seem to him only sly,
      good-natured hits, and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen
      and unaccountable old joker. That odd sort of wayward mood I am
      speaking of, comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation;
      it comes in the very midst of his earnestness, so that what just before
      might have seemed to him a thing most momentous, now seems but a part
      of the general joke. There is nothing like the perils of whaling to
      breed this free and easy sort of genial, desperado philosophy; and with
      it I now regarded this whole voyage of the Pequod, and the great White
      Whale its object.
      
      “Queequeg,” said I, when they had dragged me, the last man, to the
      deck, and I was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the
      water; “Queequeg, my fine friend, does this sort of thing often
      happen?” Without much emotion, though soaked through just like me, he
      gave me to understand that such things did often happen.
      
      “Mr. Stubb,” said I, turning to that worthy, who, buttoned up in his
      oil-jacket, was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain; “Mr. Stubb, I
      think I have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met, our chief
      mate, Mr. Starbuck, is by far the most careful and prudent. I suppose
      then, that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy
      squall is the height of a whaleman’s discretion?”
      
      “Certain. I’ve lowered for whales from a leaking ship in a gale off
      Cape Horn.”
      
      “Mr. Flask,” said I, turning to little King-Post, who was standing
      close by; “you are experienced in these things, and I am not. Will you
      tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery, Mr. Flask,
      for an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself back-foremost into
      death’s jaws?”
      
      “Can’t you twist that smaller?” said Flask. “Yes, that’s the law. I
      should like to see a boat’s crew backing water up to a whale face
      foremost. Ha, ha! the whale would give them squint for squint, mind
      that!”
      
      Here then, from three impartial witnesses, I had a deliberate statement
      of the entire case. Considering, therefore, that squalls and capsizings
      in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep, were matters of
      common occurrence in this kind of life; considering that at the
      superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale I must resign
      my life into the hands of him who steered the boat—oftentimes a fellow
      who at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of
      scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings; considering that
      the particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be
      imputed to Starbuck’s driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a
      squall, and considering that Starbuck, notwithstanding, was famous for
      his great heedfulness in the fishery; considering that I belonged to
      this uncommonly prudent Starbuck’s boat; and finally considering in
      what a devil’s chase I was implicated, touching the White Whale: taking
      all things together, I say, I thought I might as well go below and make
      a rough draft of my will. “Queequeg,” said I, “come along, you shall be
      my lawyer, executor, and legatee.”
      
      It may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at
      their last wills and testaments, but there are no people in the world
      more fond of that diversion. This was the fourth time in my nautical
      life that I had done the same thing. After the ceremony was concluded
      upon the present occasion, I felt all the easier; a stone was rolled
      away from my heart. Besides, all the days I should now live would be as
      good as the days that Lazarus lived after his resurrection; a
      supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might
      be. I survived myself; my death and burial were locked up in my chest.
      I looked round me tranquilly and contentedly, like a quiet ghost with a
      clean conscience sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault.
      
      Now then, thought I, unconsciously rolling up the sleeves of my frock,
      here goes for a cool, collected dive at death and destruction, and the
      devil fetch the hindmost.
      
      
      CHAPTER 50. Ahab’s Boat and Crew. Fedallah.
      
      “Who would have thought it, Flask!” cried Stubb; “if I had but one leg
      you would not catch me in a boat, unless maybe to stop the plug-hole
      with my timber toe. Oh! he’s a wonderful old man!”
      
      “I don’t think it so strange, after all, on that account,” said Flask.
      “If his leg were off at the hip, now, it would be a different thing.
      That would disable him; but he has one knee, and good part of the other
      left, you know.”
      
      “I don’t know that, my little man; I never yet saw him kneel.”
      
      Among whale-wise people it has often been argued whether, considering
      the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage, it
      is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active
      perils of the chase. So Tamerlane’s soldiers often argued with tears in
      their eyes, whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried
      into the thickest of the fight.
      
      But with Ahab the question assumed a modified aspect. Considering that
      with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger;
      considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and
      extraordinary difficulties; that every individual moment, indeed, then
      comprises a peril; under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed
      man to enter a whale-boat in the hunt? As a general thing, the
      joint-owners of the Pequod must have plainly thought not.
      
      Ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of
      his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of
      the chase, for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving
      his orders in person, yet for Captain Ahab to have a boat actually
      apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the hunt—above all for
      Captain Ahab to be supplied with five extra men, as that same boat’s
      crew, he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads
      of the owners of the Pequod. Therefore he had not solicited a boat’s
      crew from them, nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head.
      Nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that
      matter. Until Cabaco’s published discovery, the sailors had little
      foreseen it, though to be sure when, after being a little while out of
      port, all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the
      whaleboats for service; when some time after this Ahab was now and then
      found bestirring himself in the matter of making thole-pins with his
      own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats, and even
      solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers, which when the line is
      running out are pinned over the groove in the bow: when all this was
      observed in him, and particularly his solicitude in having an extra
      coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat, as if to make it better
      withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb; and also the anxiety
      he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board, or clumsy cleat, as it
      is sometimes called, the horizontal piece in the boat’s bow for bracing
      the knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale; when it was
      observed how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee
      fixed in the semi-circular depression in the cleat, and with the
      carpenter’s chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a
      little there; all these things, I say, had awakened much interest and
      curiosity at the time. But almost everybody supposed that this
      particular preparative heedfulness in Ahab must only be with a view to
      the ultimate chase of Moby Dick; for he had already revealed his
      intention to hunt that mortal monster in person. But such a supposition
      did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boat’s crew
      being assigned to that boat.
      
      Now, with the subordinate phantoms, what wonder remained soon waned
      away; for in a whaler wonders soon wane. Besides, now and then such
      unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown
      nooks and ash-holes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of
      whalers; and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway
      creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks, bits of wreck,
      oars, whaleboats, canoes, blown-off Japanese junks, and what not; that
      Beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin
      to chat with the captain, and it would not create any unsubduable
      excitement in the forecastle.
      
      But be all this as it may, certain it is that while the subordinate
      phantoms soon found their place among the crew, though still as it were
      somehow distinct from them, yet that hair-turbaned Fedallah remained a
      muffled mystery to the last. Whence he came in a mannerly world like
      this, by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be
      linked with Ahab’s peculiar fortunes; nay, so far as to have some sort
      of a half-hinted influence; Heaven knows, but it might have been even
      authority over him; all this none knew. But one cannot sustain an
      indifferent air concerning Fedallah. He was such a creature as
      civilized, domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their
      dreams, and that but dimly; but the like of whom now and then glide
      among the unchanging Asiatic communities, especially the Oriental isles
      to the east of the continent—those insulated, immemorial, unalterable
      countries, which even in these modern days still preserve much of the
      ghostly aboriginalness of earth’s primal generations, when the memory
      of the first man was a distinct recollection, and all men his
      descendants, unknowing whence he came, eyed each other as real
      phantoms, and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and
      to what end; when though, according to Genesis, the angels indeed
      consorted with the daughters of men, the devils also, add the
      uncanonical Rabbins, indulged in mundane amours.
      
      
      CHAPTER 51. The Spirit-Spout.
      
      Days, weeks passed, and under easy sail, the ivory Pequod had slowly
      swept across four several cruising-grounds; that off the Azores; off
      the Cape de Verdes; on the Plate (so called), being off the mouth of
      the Rio de la Plata; and the Carrol Ground, an unstaked, watery
      locality, southerly from St. Helena.
      
      It was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and
      moonlight night, when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver;
      and, by their soft, suffusing seethings, made what seemed a silvery
      silence, not a solitude; on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen
      far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow. Lit up by the moon, it
      looked celestial; seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from
      the sea. Fedallah first descried this jet. For of these moonlight
      nights, it was his wont to mount to the main-mast head, and stand a
      look-out there, with the same precision as if it had been day. And yet,
      though herds of whales were seen by night, not one whaleman in a
      hundred would venture a lowering for them. You may think with what
      emotions, then, the seamen beheld this old Oriental perched aloft at
      such unusual hours; his turban and the moon, companions in one sky. But
      when, after spending his uniform interval there for several successive
      nights without uttering a single sound; when, after all this silence,
      his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery, moon-lit jet,
      every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit
      had lighted in the rigging, and hailed the mortal crew. “There she
      blows!” Had the trump of judgment blown, they could not have quivered
      more; yet still they felt no terror; rather pleasure. For though it was
      a most unwonted hour, yet so impressive was the cry, and so deliriously
      exciting, that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a
      lowering.
      
      Walking the deck with quick, side-lunging strides, Ahab commanded the
      t’gallant sails and royals to be set, and every stunsail spread. The
      best man in the ship must take the helm. Then, with every mast-head
      manned, the piled-up craft rolled down before the wind. The strange,
      upheaving, lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows
      of so many sails, made the buoyant, hovering deck to feel like air
      beneath the feet; while still she rushed along, as if two antagonistic
      influences were struggling in her—one to mount direct to heaven, the
      other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal. And had you watched
      Ahab’s face that night, you would have thought that in him also two
      different things were warring. While his one live leg made lively
      echoes along the deck, every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a
      coffin-tap. On life and death this old man walked. But though the ship
      so swiftly sped, and though from every eye, like arrows, the eager
      glances shot, yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night. Every
      sailor swore he saw it once, but not a second time.
      
      This midnight-spout had almost grown a forgotten thing, when, some days
      after, lo! at the same silent hour, it was again announced: again it
      was descried by all; but upon making sail to overtake it, once more it
      disappeared as if it had never been. And so it served us night after
      night, till no one heeded it but to wonder at it. Mysteriously jetted
      into the clear moonlight, or starlight, as the case might be;
      disappearing again for one whole day, or two days, or three; and
      somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still
      further and further in our van, this solitary jet seemed for ever
      alluring us on.
      
      Nor with the immemorial superstition of their race, and in accordance
      with the preternaturalness, as it seemed, which in many things invested
      the Pequod, were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that
      whenever and wherever descried; at however remote times, or in however
      far apart latitudes and longitudes, that unnearable spout was cast by
      one self-same whale; and that whale, Moby Dick. For a time, there
      reigned, too, a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition, as
      if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on, in order that the
      monster might turn round upon us, and rend us at last in the remotest
      and most savage seas.
      
      These temporary apprehensions, so vague but so awful, derived a
      wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather, in
      which, beneath all its blue blandness, some thought there lurked a
      devilish charm, as for days and days we voyaged along, through seas so
      wearily, lonesomely mild, that all space, in repugnance to our vengeful
      errand, seemed vacating itself of life before our urn-like prow.
      
      But, at last, when turning to the eastward, the Cape winds began
      howling around us, and we rose and fell upon the long, troubled seas
      that are there; when the ivory-tusked Pequod sharply bowed to the
      blast, and gored the dark waves in her madness, till, like showers of
      silver chips, the foam-flakes flew over her bulwarks; then all this
      desolate vacuity of life went away, but gave place to sights more
      dismal than before.
      
      Close to our bows, strange forms in the water darted hither and thither
      before us; while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable sea-ravens. And
      every morning, perched on our stays, rows of these birds were seen; and
      spite of our hootings, for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp,
      as though they deemed our ship some drifting, uninhabited craft; a
      thing appointed to desolation, and therefore fit roosting-place for
      their homeless selves. And heaved and heaved, still unrestingly heaved
      the black sea, as if its vast tides were a conscience; and the great
      mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering
      it had bred.
      
      Cape of Good Hope, do they call ye? Rather Cape Tormentoso, as called
      of yore; for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had
      attended us, we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea, where
      guilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish, seemed
      condemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store, or beat
      that black air without any horizon. But calm, snow-white, and
      unvarying; still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky; still
      beckoning us on from before, the solitary jet would at times be
      descried.
      
      During all this blackness of the elements, Ahab, though assuming for
      the time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous
      deck, manifested the gloomiest reserve; and more seldom than ever
      addressed his mates. In tempestuous times like these, after everything
      above and aloft has been secured, nothing more can be done but
      passively to await the issue of the gale. Then Captain and crew become
      practical fatalists. So, with his ivory leg inserted into its
      accustomed hole, and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud, Ahab for
      hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward, while an
      occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very
      eyelashes together. Meantime, the crew driven from the forward part of
      the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows,
      stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist; and the better to
      guard against the leaping waves, each man had slipped himself into a
      sort of bowline secured to the rail, in which he swung as in a loosened
      belt. Few or no words were spoken; and the silent ship, as if manned by
      painted sailors in wax, day after day tore on through all the swift
      madness and gladness of the demoniac waves. By night the same muteness
      of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed; still in silence
      the men swung in the bowlines; still wordless Ahab stood up to the
      blast. Even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not
      seek that repose in his hammock. Never could Starbuck forget the old
      man’s aspect, when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the
      barometer stood, he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his
      floor-screwed chair; the rain and half-melted sleet of the storm from
      which he had some time before emerged, still slowly dripping from the
      unremoved hat and coat. On the table beside him lay unrolled one of
      those charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken
      of. His lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand. Though the body
      was erect, the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were
      pointed towards the needle of the tell-tale that swung from a beam in
      the ceiling.*
      
      *The cabin-compass is called the tell-tale, because without going to
      the compass at the helm, the Captain, while below, can inform himself
      of the course of the ship.
      
      Terrible old man! thought Starbuck with a shudder, sleeping in this
      gale, still thou steadfastly eyest thy purpose.
      
      
      CHAPTER 52. The Albatross.
      
      South-eastward from the Cape, off the distant Crozetts, a good cruising
      ground for Right Whalemen, a sail loomed ahead, the Goney (Albatross)
      by name. As she slowly drew nigh, from my lofty perch at the
      fore-mast-head, I had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro
      in the far ocean fisheries—a whaler at sea, and long absent from home.
      
      As if the waves had been fullers, this craft was bleached like the
      skeleton of a stranded walrus. All down her sides, this spectral
      appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust, while all
      her spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred
      over with hoar-frost. Only her lower sails were set. A wild sight it
      was to see her long-bearded look-outs at those three mast-heads. They
      seemed clad in the skins of beasts, so torn and bepatched the raiment
      that had survived nearly four years of cruising. Standing in iron hoops
      nailed to the mast, they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea; and
      though, when the ship slowly glided close under our stern, we six men
      in the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped
      from the mast-heads of one ship to those of the other; yet, those
      forlorn-looking fishermen, mildly eyeing us as they passed, said not
      one word to our own look-outs, while the quarter-deck hail was being
      heard from below.
      
      “Ship ahoy! Have ye seen the White Whale?”
      
      But as the strange captain, leaning over the pallid bulwarks, was in
      the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth, it somehow fell from his
      hand into the sea; and the wind now rising amain, he in vain strove to
      make himself heard without it. Meantime his ship was still increasing
      the distance between. While in various silent ways the seamen of the
      Pequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the
      first mere mention of the White Whale’s name to another ship, Ahab for
      a moment paused; it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a
      boat to board the stranger, had not the threatening wind forbade. But
      taking advantage of his windward position, he again seized his trumpet,
      and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a Nantucketer
      and shortly bound home, he loudly hailed—“Ahoy there! This is the
      Pequod, bound round the world! Tell them to address all future letters
      to the Pacific ocean! and this time three years, if I am not at home,
      tell them to address them to ——”
      
      At that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed, and instantly, then,
      in accordance with their singular ways, shoals of small harmless fish,
      that for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side,
      darted away with what seemed shuddering fins, and ranged themselves
      fore and aft with the stranger’s flanks. Though in the course of his
      continual voyagings Ahab must often before have noticed a similar
      sight, yet, to any monomaniac man, the veriest trifles capriciously
      carry meanings.
      
      “Swim away from me, do ye?” murmured Ahab, gazing over into the water.
      There seemed but little in the words, but the tone conveyed more of
      deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced.
      But turning to the steersman, who thus far had been holding the ship in
      the wind to diminish her headway, he cried out in his old lion
      voice,—“Up helm! Keep her off round the world!”
      
      Round the world! There is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings;
      but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct? Only through
      numberless perils to the very point whence we started, where those that
      we left behind secure, were all the time before us.
      
      Were this world an endless plain, and by sailing eastward we could for
      ever reach new distances, and discover sights more sweet and strange
      than any Cyclades or Islands of King Solomon, then there were promise
      in the voyage. But in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of, or in
      tormented chase of that demon phantom that, some time or other, swims
      before all human hearts; while chasing such over this round globe, they
      either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed.
      
      
      CHAPTER 53. The Gam.
      
      The ostensible reason why Ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had
      spoken was this: the wind and sea betokened storms. But even had this
      not been the case, he would not after all, perhaps, have boarded
      her—judging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasions—if so it had
      been that, by the process of hailing, he had obtained a negative answer
      to the question he put. For, as it eventually turned out, he cared not
      to consort, even for five minutes, with any stranger captain, except he
      could contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought. But
      all this might remain inadequately estimated, were not something said
      here of the peculiar usages of whaling-vessels when meeting each other
      in foreign seas, and especially on a common cruising-ground.
      
      If two strangers crossing the Pine Barrens in New York State, or the
      equally desolate Salisbury Plain in England; if casually encountering
      each other in such inhospitable wilds, these twain, for the life of
      them, cannot well avoid a mutual salutation; and stopping for a moment
      to interchange the news; and, perhaps, sitting down for a while and
      resting in concert: then, how much more natural that upon the
      illimitable Pine Barrens and Salisbury Plains of the sea, two whaling
      vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earth—off lone
      Fanning’s Island, or the far away King’s Mills; how much more natural,
      I say, that under such circumstances these ships should not only
      interchange hails, but come into still closer, more friendly and
      sociable contact. And especially would this seem to be a matter of
      course, in the case of vessels owned in one seaport, and whose
      captains, officers, and not a few of the men are personally known to
      each other; and consequently, have all sorts of dear domestic things to
      talk about.
      
      For the long absent ship, the outward-bounder, perhaps, has letters on
      board; at any rate, she will be sure to let her have some papers of a
      date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and
      thumb-worn files. And in return for that courtesy, the outward-bound
      ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the
      cruising-ground to which she may be destined, a thing of the utmost
      importance to her. And in degree, all this will hold true concerning
      whaling vessels crossing each other’s track on the cruising-ground
      itself, even though they are equally long absent from home. For one of
      them may have received a transfer of letters from some third, and now
      far remote vessel; and some of those letters may be for the people of
      the ship she now meets. Besides, they would exchange the whaling news,
      and have an agreeable chat. For not only would they meet with all the
      sympathies of sailors, but likewise with all the peculiar
      congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared
      privations and perils.
      
      Nor would difference of country make any very essential difference;
      that is, so long as both parties speak one language, as is the case
      with Americans and English. Though, to be sure, from the small number
      of English whalers, such meetings do not very often occur, and when
      they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them;
      for your Englishman is rather reserved, and your Yankee, he does not
      fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself. Besides, the English
      whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the
      American whalers; regarding the long, lean Nantucketer, with his
      nondescript provincialisms, as a sort of sea-peasant. But where this
      superiority in the English whalemen does really consist, it would be
      hard to say, seeing that the Yankees in one day, collectively, kill
      more whales than all the English, collectively, in ten years. But this
      is a harmless little foible in the English whale-hunters, which the
      Nantucketer does not take much to heart; probably, because he knows
      that he has a few foibles himself.
      
      So, then, we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea, the
      whalers have most reason to be sociable—and they are so. Whereas, some
      merchant ships crossing each other’s wake in the mid-Atlantic, will
      oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition,
      mutually cutting each other on the high seas, like a brace of dandies
      in Broadway; and all the time indulging, perhaps, in finical criticism
      upon each other’s rig. As for Men-of-War, when they chance to meet at
      sea, they first go through such a string of silly bowings and
      scrapings, such a ducking of ensigns, that there does not seem to be
      much right-down hearty good-will and brotherly love about it at all. As
      touching Slave-ships meeting, why, they are in such a prodigious hurry,
      they run away from each other as soon as possible. And as for Pirates,
      when they chance to cross each other’s cross-bones, the first hail
      is—“How many skulls?”—the same way that whalers hail—“How many
      barrels?” And that question once answered, pirates straightway steer
      apart, for they are infernal villains on both sides, and don’t like to
      see overmuch of each other’s villanous likenesses.
      
      But look at the godly, honest, unostentatious, hospitable, sociable,
      free-and-easy whaler! What does the whaler do when she meets another
      whaler in any sort of decent weather? She has a “_Gam_,” a thing so
      utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name
      even; and if by chance they should hear of it, they only grin at it,
      and repeat gamesome stuff about “spouters” and “blubber-boilers,” and
      such like pretty exclamations. Why it is that all Merchant-seamen, and
      also all Pirates and Man-of-War’s men, and Slave-ship sailors, cherish
      such a scornful feeling towards Whale-ships; this is a question it
      would be hard to answer. Because, in the case of pirates, say, I should
      like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory
      about it. It sometimes ends in uncommon elevation, indeed; but only at
      the gallows. And besides, when a man is elevated in that odd fashion,
      he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude. Hence, I
      conclude, that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman,
      in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on.
      
      But what is a _Gam?_ You might wear out your index-finger running up
      and down the columns of dictionaries, and never find the word. Dr.
      Johnson never attained to that erudition; Noah Webster’s ark does not
      hold it. Nevertheless, this same expressive word has now for many years
      been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born Yankees.
      Certainly, it needs a definition, and should be incorporated into the
      Lexicon. With that view, let me learnedly define it.
      
      GAM. NOUN—_A social meeting of two_ (_or more_) _Whaleships, generally
      on a cruising-ground; when, after exchanging hails, they exchange
      visits by boats’ crews: the two captains remaining, for the time, on
      board of one ship, and the two chief mates on the other._
      
      There is another little item about Gamming which must not be forgotten
      here. All professions have their own little peculiarities of detail; so
      has the whale fishery. In a pirate, man-of-war, or slave ship, when the
      captain is rowed anywhere in his boat, he always sits in the stern
      sheets on a comfortable, sometimes cushioned seat there, and often
      steers himself with a pretty little milliner’s tiller decorated with
      gay cords and ribbons. But the whale-boat has no seat astern, no sofa
      of that sort whatever, and no tiller at all. High times indeed, if
      whaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old
      aldermen in patent chairs. And as for a tiller, the whale-boat never
      admits of any such effeminacy; and therefore as in gamming a complete
      boat’s crew must leave the ship, and hence as the boat steerer or
      harpooneer is of the number, that subordinate is the steersman upon the
      occasion, and the captain, having no place to sit in, is pulled off to
      his visit all standing like a pine tree. And often you will notice that
      being conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him
      from the sides of the two ships, this standing captain is all alive to
      the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs. Nor
      is this any very easy matter; for in his rear is the immense projecting
      steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back, the
      after-oar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front. He is thus
      completely wedged before and behind, and can only expand himself
      sideways by settling down on his stretched legs; but a sudden, violent
      pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him, because length of
      foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth. Merely make a
      spread angle of two poles, and you cannot stand them up. Then, again,
      it would never do in plain sight of the world’s riveted eyes, it would
      never do, I say, for this straddling captain to be seen steadying
      himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his
      hands; indeed, as token of his entire, buoyant self-command, he
      generally carries his hands in his trowsers’ pockets; but perhaps being
      generally very large, heavy hands, he carries them there for ballast.
      Nevertheless there have occurred instances, well authenticated ones
      too, where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment
      or two, in a sudden squall say—to seize hold of the nearest oarsman’s
      hair, and hold on there like grim death.
      
      
      CHAPTER 54. The Town-Ho’s Story.
      
      (_As told at the Golden Inn._)
      
      The Cape of Good Hope, and all the watery region round about there, is
      much like some noted four corners of a great highway, where you meet
      more travellers than in any other part.
      
      It was not very long after speaking the Goney that another
      homeward-bound whaleman, the Town-Ho,* was encountered. She was manned
      almost wholly by Polynesians. In the short gam that ensued she gave us
      strong news of Moby Dick. To some the general interest in the White
      Whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the Town-Ho’s
      story, which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain
      wondrous, inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of
      God which at times are said to overtake some men. This latter
      circumstance, with its own particular accompaniments, forming what may
      be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated, never
      reached the ears of Captain Ahab or his mates. For that secret part of
      the story was unknown to the captain of the Town-Ho himself. It was the
      private property of three confederate white seamen of that ship, one of
      whom, it seems, communicated it to Tashtego with Romish injunctions of
      secrecy, but the following night Tashtego rambled in his sleep, and
      revealed so much of it in that way, that when he was wakened he could
      not well withhold the rest. Nevertheless, so potent an influence did
      this thing have on those seamen in the Pequod who came to the full
      knowledge of it, and by such a strange delicacy, to call it so, were
      they governed in this matter, that they kept the secret among
      themselves so that it never transpired abaft the Pequod’s main-mast.
      Interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as
      publicly narrated on the ship, the whole of this strange affair I now
      proceed to put on lasting record.
      
      *The ancient whale-cry upon first sighting a whale from the mast-head,
      still used by whalemen in hunting the famous Gallipagos terrapin.
      
      For my humor’s sake, I shall preserve the style in which I once
      narrated it at Lima, to a lounging circle of my Spanish friends, one
      saint’s eve, smoking upon the thick-gilt tiled piazza of the Golden
      Inn. Of those fine cavaliers, the young Dons, Pedro and Sebastian, were
      on the closer terms with me; and hence the interluding questions they
      occasionally put, and which are duly answered at the time.
      
      “Some two years prior to my first learning the events which I am about
      rehearsing to you, gentlemen, the Town-Ho, Sperm Whaler of Nantucket,
      was cruising in your Pacific here, not very many days’ sail eastward
      from the eaves of this good Golden Inn. She was somewhere to the
      northward of the Line. One morning upon handling the pumps, according
      to daily usage, it was observed that she made more water in her hold
      than common. They supposed a sword-fish had stabbed her, gentlemen. But
      the captain, having some unusual reason for believing that rare good
      luck awaited him in those latitudes; and therefore being very averse to
      quit them, and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous,
      though, indeed, they could not find it after searching the hold as low
      down as was possible in rather heavy weather, the ship still continued
      her cruisings, the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy
      intervals; but no good luck came; more days went by, and not only was
      the leak yet undiscovered, but it sensibly increased. So much so, that
      now taking some alarm, the captain, making all sail, stood away for the
      nearest harbor among the islands, there to have his hull hove out and
      repaired.
      
      “Though no small passage was before her, yet, if the commonest chance
      favoured, he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the
      way, because his pumps were of the best, and being periodically
      relieved at them, those six-and-thirty men of his could easily keep the
      ship free; never mind if the leak should double on her. In truth, well
      nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous
      breezes, the Town-Ho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at
      her port without the occurrence of the least fatality, had it not been
      for the brutal overbearing of Radney, the mate, a Vineyarder, and the
      bitterly provoked vengeance of Steelkilt, a Lakeman and desperado from
      Buffalo.
      
      “‘Lakeman!—Buffalo! Pray, what is a Lakeman, and where is Buffalo?’
      said Don Sebastian, rising in his swinging mat of grass.
      
      “On the eastern shore of our Lake Erie, Don; but—I crave your
      courtesy—may be, you shall soon hear further of all that. Now,
      gentlemen, in square-sail brigs and three-masted ships, well-nigh as
      large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old Callao to far
      Manilla; this Lakeman, in the land-locked heart of our America, had yet
      been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly
      connected with the open ocean. For in their interflowing aggregate,
      those grand fresh-water seas of ours,—Erie, and Ontario, and Huron, and
      Superior, and Michigan,—possess an ocean-like expansiveness, with many
      of the ocean’s noblest traits; with many of its rimmed varieties of
      races and of climes. They contain round archipelagoes of romantic
      isles, even as the Polynesian waters do; in large part, are shored by
      two great contrasting nations, as the Atlantic is; they furnish long
      maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the East,
      dotted all round their banks; here and there are frowned upon by
      batteries, and by the goat-like craggy guns of lofty Mackinaw; they
      have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories; at intervals, they
      yield their beaches to wild barbarians, whose red painted faces flash
      from out their peltry wigwams; for leagues and leagues are flanked by
      ancient and unentered forests, where the gaunt pines stand like serried
      lines of kings in Gothic genealogies; those same woods harboring wild
      Afric beasts of prey, and silken creatures whose exported furs give
      robes to Tartar Emperors; they mirror the paved capitals of Buffalo and
      Cleveland, as well as Winnebago villages; they float alike the
      full-rigged merchant ship, the armed cruiser of the State, the steamer,
      and the beech canoe; they are swept by Borean and dismasting blasts as
      direful as any that lash the salted wave; they know what shipwrecks
      are, for out of sight of land, however inland, they have drowned full
      many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew. Thus, gentlemen,
      though an inlander, Steelkilt was wild-ocean born, and wild-ocean
      nurtured; as much of an audacious mariner as any. And for Radney,
      though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone Nantucket
      beach, to nurse at his maternal sea; though in after life he had long
      followed our austere Atlantic and your contemplative Pacific; yet was
      he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods
      seaman, fresh from the latitudes of buck-horn handled Bowie-knives. Yet
      was this Nantucketer a man with some good-hearted traits; and this
      Lakeman, a mariner, who though a sort of devil indeed, might yet by
      inflexible firmness, only tempered by that common decency of human
      recognition which is the meanest slave’s right; thus treated, this
      Steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile. At all events, he
      had proved so thus far; but Radney was doomed and made mad, and
      Steelkilt—but, gentlemen, you shall hear.
      
      “It was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her
      prow for her island haven, that the Town-Ho’s leak seemed again
      increasing, but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps
      every day. You must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our
      Atlantic, for example, some skippers think little of pumping their
      whole way across it; though of a still, sleepy night, should the
      officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect, the
      probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again
      remember it, on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom.
      Nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward,
      gentlemen, is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their
      pump-handles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length;
      that is, if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast, or if any other
      reasonable retreat is afforded them. It is only when a leaky vessel is
      in some very out of the way part of those waters, some really landless
      latitude, that her captain begins to feel a little anxious.
      
      “Much this way had it been with the Town-Ho; so when her leak was found
      gaining once more, there was in truth some small concern manifested by
      several of her company; especially by Radney the mate. He commanded the
      upper sails to be well hoisted, sheeted home anew, and every way
      expanded to the breeze. Now this Radney, I suppose, was as little of a
      coward, and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness
      touching his own person as any fearless, unthinking creature on land or
      on sea that you can conveniently imagine, gentlemen. Therefore when he
      betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship, some of the
      seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner
      in her. So when they were working that evening at the pumps, there was
      on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them, as they
      stood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear
      water; clear as any mountain spring, gentlemen—that bubbling from the
      pumps ran across the deck, and poured itself out in steady spouts at
      the lee scupper-holes.
      
      “Now, as you well know, it is not seldom the case in this conventional
      world of ours—watery or otherwise; that when a person placed in command
      over his fellow-men finds one of them to be very significantly his
      superior in general pride of manhood, straightway against that man he
      conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness; and if he have a
      chance he will pull down and pulverize that subaltern’s tower, and make
      a little heap of dust of it. Be this conceit of mine as it may,
      gentlemen, at all events Steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a
      head like a Roman, and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled
      housings of your last viceroy’s snorting charger; and a brain, and a
      heart, and a soul in him, gentlemen, which had made Steelkilt
      Charlemagne, had he been born son to Charlemagne’s father. But Radney,
      the mate, was ugly as a mule; yet as hardy, as stubborn, as malicious.
      He did not love Steelkilt, and Steelkilt knew it.
      
      “Espying the mate drawing near as he was toiling at the pump with the
      rest, the Lakeman affected not to notice him, but unawed, went on with
      his gay banterings.
      
      “‘Aye, aye, my merry lads, it’s a lively leak this; hold a cannikin,
      one of ye, and let’s have a taste. By the Lord, it’s worth bottling! I
      tell ye what, men, old Rad’s investment must go for it! he had best cut
      away his part of the hull and tow it home. The fact is, boys, that
      sword-fish only began the job; he’s come back again with a gang of
      ship-carpenters, saw-fish, and file-fish, and what not; and the whole
      posse of ’em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom;
      making improvements, I suppose. If old Rad were here now, I’d tell him
      to jump overboard and scatter ’em. They’re playing the devil with his
      estate, I can tell him. But he’s a simple old soul,—Rad, and a beauty
      too. Boys, they say the rest of his property is invested in
      looking-glasses. I wonder if he’d give a poor devil like me the model
      of his nose.’
      
      “‘Damn your eyes! what’s that pump stopping for?’ roared Radney,
      pretending not to have heard the sailors’ talk. ‘Thunder away at it!’
      
      “‘Aye, aye, sir,’ said Steelkilt, merry as a cricket. ‘Lively, boys,
      lively, now!’ And with that the pump clanged like fifty fire-engines;
      the men tossed their hats off to it, and ere long that peculiar gasping
      of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of life’s
      utmost energies.
      
      “Quitting the pump at last, with the rest of his band, the Lakeman went
      forward all panting, and sat himself down on the windlass; his face
      fiery red, his eyes bloodshot, and wiping the profuse sweat from his
      brow. Now what cozening fiend it was, gentlemen, that possessed Radney
      to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state, I know
      not; but so it happened. Intolerably striding along the deck, the mate
      commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks, and also a
      shovel, and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a
      pig to run at large.
      
      “Now, gentlemen, sweeping a ship’s deck at sea is a piece of household
      work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every
      evening; it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually
      foundering at the time. Such, gentlemen, is the inflexibility of
      sea-usages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen; some of whom
      would not willingly drown without first washing their faces. But in all
      vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys,
      if boys there be aboard. Besides, it was the stronger men in the
      Town-Ho that had been divided into gangs, taking turns at the pumps;
      and being the most athletic seaman of them all, Steelkilt had been
      regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs; consequently he should
      have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly
      nautical duties, such being the case with his comrades. I mention all
      these particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair
      stood between the two men.
      
      “But there was more than this: the order about the shovel was almost as
      plainly meant to sting and insult Steelkilt, as though Radney had spat
      in his face. Any man who has gone sailor in a whale-ship will
      understand this; and all this and doubtless much more, the Lakeman
      fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command. But as he sat
      still for a moment, and as he steadfastly looked into the mate’s
      malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powder-casks heaped up in him
      and the slow-match silently burning along towards them; as he
      instinctively saw all this, that strange forbearance and unwillingness
      to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful being—a
      repugnance most felt, when felt at all, by really valiant men even when
      aggrieved—this nameless phantom feeling, gentlemen, stole over
      Steelkilt.
      
      “Therefore, in his ordinary tone, only a little broken by the bodily
      exhaustion he was temporarily in, he answered him saying that sweeping
      the deck was not his business, and he would not do it. And then,
      without at all alluding to the shovel, he pointed to three lads as the
      customary sweepers; who, not being billeted at the pumps, had done
      little or nothing all day. To this, Radney replied with an oath, in a
      most domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his
      command; meanwhile advancing upon the still seated Lakeman, with an
      uplifted cooper’s club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near
      by.
      
      “Heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps, for
      all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating Steelkilt
      could but ill brook this bearing in the mate; but somehow still
      smothering the conflagration within him, without speaking he remained
      doggedly rooted to his seat, till at last the incensed Radney shook the
      hammer within a few inches of his face, furiously commanding him to do
      his bidding.
      
      “Steelkilt rose, and slowly retreating round the windlass, steadily
      followed by the mate with his menacing hammer, deliberately repeated
      his intention not to obey. Seeing, however, that his forbearance had
      not the slightest effect, by an awful and unspeakable intimation with
      his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man; but it
      was to no purpose. And in this way the two went once slowly round the
      windlass; when, resolved at last no longer to retreat, bethinking him
      that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor, the
      Lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer:
      
      “‘Mr. Radney, I will not obey you. Take that hammer away, or look to
      yourself.’ But the predestinated mate coming still closer to him, where
      the Lakeman stood fixed, now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of
      his teeth; meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions.
      Retreating not the thousandth part of an inch; stabbing him in the eye
      with the unflinching poniard of his glance, Steelkilt, clenching his
      right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back, told his
      persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he (Steelkilt) would
      murder him. But, gentlemen, the fool had been branded for the slaughter
      by the gods. Immediately the hammer touched the cheek; the next instant
      the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head; he fell on the hatch
      spouting blood like a whale.
      
      “Ere the cry could go aft Steelkilt was shaking one of the backstays
      leading far aloft to where two of his comrades were standing their
      mastheads. They were both Canallers.
      
      “‘Canallers!’ cried Don Pedro. ‘We have seen many whale-ships in our
      harbours, but never heard of your Canallers. Pardon: who and what are
      they?’
      
      “‘Canallers, Don, are the boatmen belonging to our grand Erie Canal.
      You must have heard of it.’
      
      “‘Nay, Senor; hereabouts in this dull, warm, most lazy, and hereditary
      land, we know but little of your vigorous North.’
      
      “‘Aye? Well then, Don, refill my cup. Your chicha’s very fine; and ere
      proceeding further I will tell ye what our Canallers are; for such
      information may throw side-light upon my story.’
      
      “For three hundred and sixty miles, gentlemen, through the entire
      breadth of the state of New York; through numerous populous cities and
      most thriving villages; through long, dismal, uninhabited swamps, and
      affluent, cultivated fields, unrivalled for fertility; by billiard-room
      and bar-room; through the holy-of-holies of great forests; on Roman
      arches over Indian rivers; through sun and shade; by happy hearts or
      broken; through all the wide contrasting scenery of those noble Mohawk
      counties; and especially, by rows of snow-white chapels, whose spires
      stand almost like milestones, flows one continual stream of Venetianly
      corrupt and often lawless life. There’s your true Ashantee, gentlemen;
      there howl your pagans; where you ever find them, next door to you;
      under the long-flung shadow, and the snug patronising lee of churches.
      For by some curious fatality, as it is often noted of your metropolitan
      freebooters that they ever encamp around the halls of justice, so
      sinners, gentlemen, most abound in holiest vicinities.
      
      “‘Is that a friar passing?’ said Don Pedro, looking downwards into the
      crowded plazza, with humorous concern.
      
      “‘Well for our northern friend, Dame Isabella’s Inquisition wanes in
      Lima,’ laughed Don Sebastian. ‘Proceed, Senor.’
      
      “‘A moment! Pardon!’ cried another of the company. ‘In the name of all
      us Limeese, I but desire to express to you, sir sailor, that we have by
      no means overlooked your delicacy in not substituting present Lima for
      distant Venice in your corrupt comparison. Oh! do not bow and look
      surprised; you know the proverb all along this coast—“Corrupt as Lima.”
      It but bears out your saying, too; churches more plentiful than
      billiard-tables, and for ever open—and “Corrupt as Lima.” So, too,
      Venice; I have been there; the holy city of the blessed evangelist, St.
      Mark!—St. Dominic, purge it! Your cup! Thanks: here I refill; now, you
      pour out again.’
      
      “Freely depicted in his own vocation, gentlemen, the Canaller would
      make a fine dramatic hero, so abundantly and picturesquely wicked is
      he. Like Mark Antony, for days and days along his green-turfed, flowery
      Nile, he indolently floats, openly toying with his red-cheeked
      Cleopatra, ripening his apricot thigh upon the sunny deck. But ashore,
      all this effeminacy is dashed. The brigandish guise which the Canaller
      so proudly sports; his slouched and gaily-ribboned hat betoken his
      grand features. A terror to the smiling innocence of the villages
      through which he floats; his swart visage and bold swagger are not
      unshunned in cities. Once a vagabond on his own canal, I have received
      good turns from one of these Canallers; I thank him heartily; would
      fain be not ungrateful; but it is often one of the prime redeeming
      qualities of your man of violence, that at times he has as stiff an arm
      to back a poor stranger in a strait, as to plunder a wealthy one. In
      sum, gentlemen, what the wildness of this canal life is, is
      emphatically evinced by this; that our wild whale-fishery contains so
      many of its most finished graduates, and that scarce any race of
      mankind, except Sydney men, are so much distrusted by our whaling
      captains. Nor does it at all diminish the curiousness of this matter,
      that to many thousands of our rural boys and young men born along its
      line, the probationary life of the Grand Canal furnishes the sole
      transition between quietly reaping in a Christian corn-field, and
      recklessly ploughing the waters of the most barbaric seas.
      
      “‘I see! I see!’ impetuously exclaimed Don Pedro, spilling his chicha
      upon his silvery ruffles. ‘No need to travel! The world’s one Lima. I
      had thought, now, that at your temperate North the generations were
      cold and holy as the hills.—But the story.’
      
      “I left off, gentlemen, where the Lakeman shook the backstay. Hardly
      had he done so, when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and
      the four harpooneers, who all crowded him to the deck. But sliding down
      the ropes like baleful comets, the two Canallers rushed into the
      uproar, and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle.
      Others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt, and a twisted
      turmoil ensued; while standing out of harm’s way, the valiant captain
      danced up and down with a whale-pike, calling upon his officers to
      manhandle that atrocious scoundrel, and smoke him along to the
      quarter-deck. At intervals, he ran close up to the revolving border of
      the confusion, and prying into the heart of it with his pike, sought to
      prick out the object of his resentment. But Steelkilt and his
      desperadoes were too much for them all; they succeeded in gaining the
      forecastle deck, where, hastily slewing about three or four large casks
      in a line with the windlass, these sea-Parisians entrenched themselves
      behind the barricade.
      
      “‘Come out of that, ye pirates!’ roared the captain, now menacing them
      with a pistol in each hand, just brought to him by the steward. ‘Come
      out of that, ye cut-throats!’
      
      “Steelkilt leaped on the barricade, and striding up and down there,
      defied the worst the pistols could do; but gave the captain to
      understand distinctly, that his (Steelkilt’s) death would be the signal
      for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands. Fearing in his heart
      lest this might prove but too true, the captain a little desisted, but
      still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty.
      
      “‘Will you promise not to touch us, if we do?’ demanded their
      ringleader.
      
      “‘Turn to! turn to!—I make no promise;—to your duty! Do you want to
      sink the ship, by knocking off at a time like this? Turn to!’ and he
      once more raised a pistol.
      
      “‘Sink the ship?’ cried Steelkilt. ‘Aye, let her sink. Not a man of us
      turns to, unless you swear not to raise a rope-yarn against us. What
      say ye, men?’ turning to his comrades. A fierce cheer was their
      response.
      
      “The Lakeman now patrolled the barricade, all the while keeping his eye
      on the Captain, and jerking out such sentences as these:—‘It’s not our
      fault; we didn’t want it; I told him to take his hammer away; it was
      boy’s business; he might have known me before this; I told him not to
      prick the buffalo; I believe I have broken a finger here against his
      cursed jaw; ain’t those mincing knives down in the forecastle there,
      men? look to those handspikes, my hearties. Captain, by God, look to
      yourself; say the word; don’t be a fool; forget it all; we are ready to
      turn to; treat us decently, and we’re your men; but we won’t be
      flogged.’
      
      “‘Turn to! I make no promises, turn to, I say!’
      
      “‘Look ye, now,’ cried the Lakeman, flinging out his arm towards him,
      ‘there are a few of us here (and I am one of them) who have shipped for
      the cruise, d’ye see; now as you well know, sir, we can claim our
      discharge as soon as the anchor is down; so we don’t want a row; it’s
      not our interest; we want to be peaceable; we are ready to work, but we
      won’t be flogged.’
      
      “‘Turn to!’ roared the Captain.
      
      “Steelkilt glanced round him a moment, and then said:—‘I tell you what
      it is now, Captain, rather than kill ye, and be hung for such a shabby
      rascal, we won’t lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us; but till
      you say the word about not flogging us, we don’t do a hand’s turn.’
      
      “‘Down into the forecastle then, down with ye, I’ll keep ye there till
      ye’re sick of it. Down ye go.’
      
      “‘Shall we?’ cried the ringleader to his men. Most of them were against
      it; but at length, in obedience to Steelkilt, they preceded him down
      into their dark den, growlingly disappearing, like bears into a cave.
      
      “As the Lakeman’s bare head was just level with the planks, the Captain
      and his posse leaped the barricade, and rapidly drawing over the slide
      of the scuttle, planted their group of hands upon it, and loudly called
      for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the
      companionway. Then opening the slide a little, the Captain whispered
      something down the crack, closed it, and turned the key upon them—ten
      in number—leaving on deck some twenty or more, who thus far had
      remained neutral.
      
      “All night a wide-awake watch was kept by all the officers, forward and
      aft, especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway; at
      which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge, after
      breaking through the bulkhead below. But the hours of darkness passed
      in peace; the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the
      pumps, whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary
      night dismally resounded through the ship.
      
      “At sunrise the Captain went forward, and knocking on the deck,
      summoned the prisoners to work; but with a yell they refused. Water was
      then lowered down to them, and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were
      tossed after it; when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it,
      the Captain returned to the quarter-deck. Twice every day for three
      days this was repeated; but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling,
      and then a scuffling was heard, as the customary summons was delivered;
      and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle, saying they were
      ready to turn to. The fetid closeness of the air, and a famishing diet,
      united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution, had constrained
      them to surrender at discretion. Emboldened by this, the Captain
      reiterated his demand to the rest, but Steelkilt shouted up to him a
      terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he
      belonged. On the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up
      into the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain
      them. Only three were left.
      
      “‘Better turn to, now?’ said the Captain with a heartless jeer.
      
      “‘Shut us up again, will ye!’ cried Steelkilt.
      
      “‘Oh certainly,’ said the Captain, and the key clicked.
      
      “It was at this point, gentlemen, that enraged by the defection of
      seven of his former associates, and stung by the mocking voice that had
      last hailed him, and maddened by his long entombment in a place as
      black as the bowels of despair; it was then that Steelkilt proposed to
      the two Canallers, thus far apparently of one mind with him, to burst
      out of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison; and armed with
      their keen mincing knives (long, crescentic, heavy implements with a
      handle at each end) run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail; and if
      by any devilishness of desperation possible, seize the ship. For
      himself, he would do this, he said, whether they joined him or not.
      That was the last night he should spend in that den. But the scheme met
      with no opposition on the part of the other two; they swore they were
      ready for that, or for any other mad thing, for anything in short but a
      surrender. And what was more, they each insisted upon being the first
      man on deck, when the time to make the rush should come. But to this
      their leader as fiercely objected, reserving that priority for himself;
      particularly as his two comrades would not yield, the one to the other,
      in the matter; and both of them could not be first, for the ladder
      would but admit one man at a time. And here, gentlemen, the foul play
      of these miscreants must come out.
      
      “Upon hearing the frantic project of their leader, each in his own
      separate soul had suddenly lighted, it would seem, upon the same piece
      of treachery, namely: to be foremost in breaking out, in order to be
      the first of the three, though the last of the ten, to surrender; and
      thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might
      merit. But when Steelkilt made known his determination still to lead
      them to the last, they in some way, by some subtle chemistry of
      villany, mixed their before secret treacheries together; and when their
      leader fell into a doze, verbally opened their souls to each other in
      three sentences; and bound the sleeper with cords, and gagged him with
      cords; and shrieked out for the Captain at midnight.
      
      “Thinking murder at hand, and smelling in the dark for the blood, he
      and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle. In a
      few minutes the scuttle was opened, and, bound hand and foot, the still
      struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious
      allies, who at once claimed the honor of securing a man who had been
      fully ripe for murder. But all these were collared, and dragged along
      the deck like dead cattle; and, side by side, were seized up into the
      mizzen rigging, like three quarters of meat, and there they hung till
      morning. ‘Damn ye,’ cried the Captain, pacing to and fro before them,
      ‘the vultures would not touch ye, ye villains!’
      
      “At sunrise he summoned all hands; and separating those who had
      rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny, he told the
      former that he had a good mind to flog them all round—thought, upon the
      whole, he would do so—he ought to—justice demanded it; but for the
      present, considering their timely surrender, he would let them go with
      a reprimand, which he accordingly administered in the vernacular.
      
      “‘But as for you, ye carrion rogues,’ turning to the three men in the
      rigging—‘for you, I mean to mince ye up for the try-pots;’ and, seizing
      a rope, he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two
      traitors, till they yelled no more, but lifelessly hung their heads
      sideways, as the two crucified thieves are drawn.
      
      “‘My wrist is sprained with ye!’ he cried, at last; ‘but there is still
      rope enough left for you, my fine bantam, that wouldn’t give up. Take
      that gag from his mouth, and let us hear what he can say for himself.’
      
      “For a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his
      cramped jaws, and then painfully twisting round his head, said in a
      sort of hiss, ‘What I say is this—and mind it well—if you flog me, I
      murder you!’
      
      “‘Say ye so? then see how ye frighten me’—and the Captain drew off with
      the rope to strike.
      
      “‘Best not,’ hissed the Lakeman.
      
      “‘But I must,’—and the rope was once more drawn back for the stroke.
      
      “Steelkilt here hissed out something, inaudible to all but the Captain;
      who, to the amazement of all hands, started back, paced the deck
      rapidly two or three times, and then suddenly throwing down his rope,
      said, ‘I won’t do it—let him go—cut him down: d’ye hear?’
      
      “But as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order, a pale
      man, with a bandaged head, arrested them—Radney the chief mate. Ever
      since the blow, he had lain in his berth; but that morning, hearing the
      tumult on the deck, he had crept out, and thus far had watched the
      whole scene. Such was the state of his mouth, that he could hardly
      speak; but mumbling something about _his_ being willing and able to do
      what the captain dared not attempt, he snatched the rope and advanced
      to his pinioned foe.
      
      “‘You are a coward!’ hissed the Lakeman.
      
      “‘So I am, but take that.’ The mate was in the very act of striking,
      when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm. He paused: and then pausing
      no more, made good his word, spite of Steelkilt’s threat, whatever that
      might have been. The three men were then cut down, all hands were
      turned to, and, sullenly worked by the moody seamen, the iron pumps
      clanged as before.
      
      “Just after dark that day, when one watch had retired below, a clamor
      was heard in the forecastle; and the two trembling traitors running up,
      besieged the cabin door, saying they durst not consort with the crew.
      Entreaties, cuffs, and kicks could not drive them back, so at their own
      instance they were put down in the ship’s run for salvation. Still, no
      sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest. On the contrary, it seemed,
      that mainly at Steelkilt’s instigation, they had resolved to maintain
      the strictest peacefulness, obey all orders to the last, and, when the
      ship reached port, desert her in a body. But in order to insure the
      speediest end to the voyage, they all agreed to another thing—namely,
      not to sing out for whales, in case any should be discovered. For,
      spite of her leak, and spite of all her other perils, the Town-Ho still
      maintained her mast-heads, and her captain was just as willing to lower
      for a fish that moment, as on the day his craft first struck the
      cruising ground; and Radney the mate was quite as ready to change his
      berth for a boat, and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the
      vital jaw of the whale.
      
      “But though the Lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of
      passiveness in their conduct, he kept his own counsel (at least till
      all was over) concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the
      man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart. He was in Radney
      the chief mate’s watch; and as if the infatuated man sought to run more
      than half way to meet his doom, after the scene at the rigging, he
      insisted, against the express counsel of the captain, upon resuming the
      head of his watch at night. Upon this, and one or two other
      circumstances, Steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge.
      
      “During the night, Radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the
      bulwarks of the quarter-deck, and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of
      the boat which was hoisted up there, a little above the ship’s side. In
      this attitude, it was well known, he sometimes dozed. There was a
      considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship, and down between
      this was the sea. Steelkilt calculated his time, and found that his
      next trick at the helm would come round at two o’clock, in the morning
      of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed. At his
      leisure, he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully
      in his watches below.
      
      “‘What are you making there?’ said a shipmate.
      
      “‘What do you think? what does it look like?’
      
      “‘Like a lanyard for your bag; but it’s an odd one, seems to me.’
      
      “‘Yes, rather oddish,’ said the Lakeman, holding it at arm’s length
      before him; ‘but I think it will answer. Shipmate, I haven’t enough
      twine,—have you any?’
      
      “But there was none in the forecastle.
      
      “‘Then I must get some from old Rad;’ and he rose to go aft.
      
      “‘You don’t mean to go a begging to _him!_’ said a sailor.
      
      “‘Why not? Do you think he won’t do me a turn, when it’s to help
      himself in the end, shipmate?’ and going to the mate, he looked at him
      quietly, and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock. It was given
      him—neither twine nor lanyard were seen again; but the next night an
      iron ball, closely netted, partly rolled from the pocket of the
      Lakeman’s monkey jacket, as he was tucking the coat into his hammock
      for a pillow. Twenty-four hours after, his trick at the silent
      helm—nigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready
      dug to the seaman’s hand—that fatal hour was then to come; and in the
      fore-ordaining soul of Steelkilt, the mate was already stark and
      stretched as a corpse, with his forehead crushed in.
      
      “But, gentlemen, a fool saved the would-be murderer from the bloody
      deed he had planned. Yet complete revenge he had, and without being the
      avenger. For by a mysterious fatality, Heaven itself seemed to step in
      to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have
      done.
      
      “It was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second
      day, when they were washing down the decks, that a stupid Teneriffe
      man, drawing water in the main-chains, all at once shouted out, ‘There
      she rolls! there she rolls!’ Jesu, what a whale! It was Moby Dick.
      
      “‘Moby Dick!’ cried Don Sebastian; ‘St. Dominic! Sir sailor, but do
      whales have christenings? Whom call you Moby Dick?’
      
      “‘A very white, and famous, and most deadly immortal monster, Don;—but
      that would be too long a story.’
      
      “‘How? how?’ cried all the young Spaniards, crowding.
      
      “‘Nay, Dons, Dons—nay, nay! I cannot rehearse that now. Let me get more
      into the air, Sirs.’
      
      “‘The chicha! the chicha!’ cried Don Pedro; ‘our vigorous friend looks
      faint;—fill up his empty glass!’
      
      “No need, gentlemen; one moment, and I proceed.—Now, gentlemen, so
      suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the
      ship—forgetful of the compact among the crew—in the excitement of the
      moment, the Teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted
      his voice for the monster, though for some little time past it had been
      plainly beheld from the three sullen mast-heads. All was now a phrensy.
      ‘The White Whale—the White Whale!’ was the cry from captain, mates, and
      harpooneers, who, undeterred by fearful rumours, were all anxious to
      capture so famous and precious a fish; while the dogged crew eyed
      askance, and with curses, the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass,
      that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun, shifted and glistened like a
      living opal in the blue morning sea. Gentlemen, a strange fatality
      pervades the whole career of these events, as if verily mapped out
      before the world itself was charted. The mutineer was the bowsman of
      the mate, and when fast to a fish, it was his duty to sit next him,
      while Radney stood up with his lance in the prow, and haul in or
      slacken the line, at the word of command. Moreover, when the four boats
      were lowered, the mate’s got the start; and none howled more fiercely
      with delight than did Steelkilt, as he strained at his oar. After a
      stiff pull, their harpooneer got fast, and, spear in hand, Radney
      sprang to the bow. He was always a furious man, it seems, in a boat.
      And now his bandaged cry was, to beach him on the whale’s topmost back.
      Nothing loath, his bowsman hauled him up and up, through a blinding
      foam that blent two whitenesses together; till of a sudden the boat
      struck as against a sunken ledge, and keeling over, spilled out the
      standing mate. That instant, as he fell on the whale’s slippery back,
      the boat righted, and was dashed aside by the swell, while Radney was
      tossed over into the sea, on the other flank of the whale. He struck
      out through the spray, and, for an instant, was dimly seen through that
      veil, wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of Moby Dick. But
      the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom; seized the swimmer
      between his jaws; and rearing high up with him, plunged headlong again,
      and went down.
      
      “Meantime, at the first tap of the boat’s bottom, the Lakeman had
      slackened the line, so as to drop astern from the whirlpool; calmly
      looking on, he thought his own thoughts. But a sudden, terrific,
      downward jerking of the boat, quickly brought his knife to the line. He
      cut it; and the whale was free. But, at some distance, Moby Dick rose
      again, with some tatters of Radney’s red woollen shirt, caught in the
      teeth that had destroyed him. All four boats gave chase again; but the
      whale eluded them, and finally wholly disappeared.
      
      “In good time, the Town-Ho reached her port—a savage, solitary
      place—where no civilized creature resided. There, headed by the
      Lakeman, all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted
      among the palms; eventually, as it turned out, seizing a large double
      war-canoe of the savages, and setting sail for some other harbor.
      
      “The ship’s company being reduced to but a handful, the captain called
      upon the Islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving
      down the ship to stop the leak. But to such unresting vigilance over
      their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated, both
      by night and by day, and so extreme was the hard work they underwent,
      that upon the vessel being ready again for sea, they were in such a
      weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so
      heavy a vessel. After taking counsel with his officers, he anchored the
      ship as far off shore as possible; loaded and ran out his two cannon
      from the bows; stacked his muskets on the poop; and warning the
      Islanders not to approach the ship at their peril, took one man with
      him, and setting the sail of his best whale-boat, steered straight
      before the wind for Tahiti, five hundred miles distant, to procure a
      reinforcement to his crew.
      
      “On the fourth day of the sail, a large canoe was descried, which
      seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals. He steered away from
      it; but the savage craft bore down on him; and soon the voice of
      Steelkilt hailed him to heave to, or he would run him under water. The
      captain presented a pistol. With one foot on each prow of the yoked
      war-canoes, the Lakeman laughed him to scorn; assuring him that if the
      pistol so much as clicked in the lock, he would bury him in bubbles and
      foam.
      
      “‘What do you want of me?’ cried the captain.
      
      “‘Where are you bound? and for what are you bound?’ demanded Steelkilt;
      ‘no lies.’
      
      “‘I am bound to Tahiti for more men.’
      
      “‘Very good. Let me board you a moment—I come in peace.’ With that he
      leaped from the canoe, swam to the boat; and climbing the gunwale,
      stood face to face with the captain.
      
      “‘Cross your arms, sir; throw back your head. Now, repeat after me. As
      soon as Steelkilt leaves me, I swear to beach this boat on yonder
      island, and remain there six days. If I do not, may lightnings strike
      me!’
      
      “‘A pretty scholar,’ laughed the Lakeman. ‘Adios, Senor!’ and leaping
      into the sea, he swam back to his comrades.
      
      “Watching the boat till it was fairly beached, and drawn up to the
      roots of the cocoa-nut trees, Steelkilt made sail again, and in due
      time arrived at Tahiti, his own place of destination. There, luck
      befriended him; two ships were about to sail for France, and were
      providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor
      headed. They embarked; and so for ever got the start of their former
      captain, had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution.
      
      “Some ten days after the French ships sailed, the whale-boat arrived,
      and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized
      Tahitians, who had been somewhat used to the sea. Chartering a small
      native schooner, he returned with them to his vessel; and finding all
      right there, again resumed his cruisings.
      
      “Where Steelkilt now is, gentlemen, none know; but upon the island of
      Nantucket, the widow of Radney still turns to the sea which refuses to
      give up its dead; still in dreams sees the awful white whale that
      destroyed him.  * * * *
      
      “‘Are you through?’ said Don Sebastian, quietly.
      
      “‘I am, Don.’
      
      “‘Then I entreat you, tell me if to the best of your own convictions,
      this your story is in substance really true? It is so passing
      wonderful! Did you get it from an unquestionable source? Bear with me
      if I seem to press.’
      
      “‘Also bear with all of us, sir sailor; for we all join in Don
      Sebastian’s suit,’ cried the company, with exceeding interest.
      
      “‘Is there a copy of the Holy Evangelists in the Golden Inn,
      gentlemen?’
      
      “‘Nay,’ said Don Sebastian; ‘but I know a worthy priest near by, who
      will quickly procure one for me. I go for it; but are you well advised?
      this may grow too serious.’
      
      “‘Will you be so good as to bring the priest also, Don?’
      
      “‘Though there are no Auto-da-Fés in Lima now,’ said one of the company
      to another; ‘I fear our sailor friend runs risk of the archiepiscopacy.
      Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight. I see no need of this.’
      
      “‘Excuse me for running after you, Don Sebastian; but may I also beg
      that you will be particular in procuring the largest sized Evangelists
      you can.’
      
      * * * * * *
      
      “‘This is the priest, he brings you the Evangelists,’ said Don
      Sebastian, gravely, returning with a tall and solemn figure.
      
      “‘Let me remove my hat. Now, venerable priest, further into the light,
      and hold the Holy Book before me that I may touch it.
      
      “‘So help me Heaven, and on my honor the story I have told ye,
      gentlemen, is in substance and its great items, true. I know it to be
      true; it happened on this ball; I trod the ship; I knew the crew; I
      have seen and talked with Steelkilt since the death of Radney.’”
      
      
      CHAPTER 55. Of the Monstrous Pictures of Whales.
      
      I shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas,
      something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the
      eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored
      alongside the whale-ship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there.
      It may be worth while, therefore, previously to advert to those curious
      imaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day
      confidently challenge the faith of the landsman. It is time to set the
      world right in this matter, by proving such pictures of the whale all
      wrong.
      
      It may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will
      be found among the oldest Hindoo, Egyptian, and Grecian sculptures. For
      ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble
      panellings of temples, the pedestals of statues, and on shields,
      medallions, cups, and coins, the dolphin was drawn in scales of
      chain-armor like Saladin’s, and a helmeted head like St. George’s; ever
      since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed, not
      only in most popular pictures of the whale, but in many scientific
      presentations of him.
      
      Now, by all odds, the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting
      to be the whale’s, is to be found in the famous cavern-pagoda of
      Elephanta, in India. The Brahmins maintain that in the almost endless
      sculptures of that immemorial pagoda, all the trades and pursuits,
      every conceivable avocation of man, were prefigured ages before any of
      them actually came into being. No wonder then, that in some sort our
      noble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth. The
      Hindoo whale referred to, occurs in a separate department of the wall,
      depicting the incarnation of Vishnu in the form of leviathan, learnedly
      known as the Matse Avatar. But though this sculpture is half man and
      half whale, so as only to give the tail of the latter, yet that small
      section of him is all wrong. It looks more like the tapering tail of an
      anaconda, than the broad palms of the true whale’s majestic flukes.
      
      But go to the old Galleries, and look now at a great Christian
      painter’s portrait of this fish; for he succeeds no better than the
      antediluvian Hindoo. It is Guido’s picture of Perseus rescuing
      Andromeda from the sea-monster or whale. Where did Guido get the model
      of such a strange creature as that? Nor does Hogarth, in painting the
      same scene in his own “Perseus Descending,” make out one whit better.
      The huge corpulence of that Hogarthian monster undulates on the
      surface, scarcely drawing one inch of water. It has a sort of howdah on
      its back, and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are
      rolling, might be taken for the Traitors’ Gate leading from the Thames
      by water into the Tower. Then, there are the Prodromus whales of old
      Scotch Sibbald, and Jonah’s whale, as depicted in the prints of old
      Bibles and the cuts of old primers. What shall be said of these? As for
      the book-binder’s whale winding like a vine-stalk round the stock of a
      descending anchor—as stamped and gilded on the backs and title-pages of
      many books both old and new—that is a very picturesque but purely
      fabulous creature, imitated, I take it, from the like figures on
      antique vases. Though universally denominated a dolphin, I nevertheless
      call this book-binder’s fish an attempt at a whale; because it was so
      intended when the device was first introduced. It was introduced by an
      old Italian publisher somewhere about the 15th century, during the
      Revival of Learning; and in those days, and even down to a
      comparatively late period, dolphins were popularly supposed to be a
      species of the Leviathan.
      
      In the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you
      will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale, where all
      manner of spouts, jets d’eau, hot springs and cold, Saratoga and
      Baden-Baden, come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain. In the
      title-page of the original edition of the “Advancement of Learning” you
      will find some curious whales.
      
      But quitting all these unprofessional attempts, let us glance at those
      pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober, scientific delineations,
      by those who know. In old Harris’s collection of voyages there are some
      plates of whales extracted from a Dutch book of voyages, A.D. 1671,
      entitled “A Whaling Voyage to Spitzbergen in the ship Jonas in the
      Whale, Peter Peterson of Friesland, master.” In one of those plates the
      whales, like great rafts of logs, are represented lying among
      ice-isles, with white bears running over their living backs. In another
      plate, the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with
      perpendicular flukes.
      
      Then again, there is an imposing quarto, written by one Captain
      Colnett, a Post Captain in the English navy, entitled “A Voyage round
      Cape Horn into the South Seas, for the purpose of extending the
      Spermaceti Whale Fisheries.” In this book is an outline purporting to
      be a “Picture of a Physeter or Spermaceti whale, drawn by scale from
      one killed on the coast of Mexico, August, 1793, and hoisted on deck.”
      I doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the
      benefit of his marines. To mention but one thing about it, let me say
      that it has an eye which applied, according to the accompanying scale,
      to a full grown sperm whale, would make the eye of that whale a
      bow-window some five feet long. Ah, my gallant captain, why did ye not
      give us Jonah looking out of that eye!
      
      Nor are the most conscientious compilations of Natural History for the
      benefit of the young and tender, free from the same heinousness of
      mistake. Look at that popular work “Goldsmith’s Animated Nature.” In
      the abridged London edition of 1807, there are plates of an alleged
      “whale” and a “narwhale.” I do not wish to seem inelegant, but this
      unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow; and, as for the
      narwhale, one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one, that in this
      nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon
      any intelligent public of schoolboys.
      
      Then, again, in 1825, Bernard Germain, Count de Lacépède, a great
      naturalist, published a scientific systemized whale book, wherein are
      several pictures of the different species of the Leviathan. All these
      are not only incorrect, but the picture of the Mysticetus or Greenland
      whale (that is to say, the Right whale), even Scoresby, a long
      experienced man as touching that species, declares not to have its
      counterpart in nature.
      
      But the placing of the cap-sheaf to all this blundering business was
      reserved for the scientific Frederick Cuvier, brother to the famous
      Baron. In 1836, he published a Natural History of Whales, in which he
      gives what he calls a picture of the Sperm Whale. Before showing that
      picture to any Nantucketer, you had best provide for your summary
      retreat from Nantucket. In a word, Frederick Cuvier’s Sperm Whale is
      not a Sperm Whale, but a squash. Of course, he never had the benefit of
      a whaling voyage (such men seldom have), but whence he derived that
      picture, who can tell? Perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor
      in the same field, Desmarest, got one of his authentic abortions; that
      is, from a Chinese drawing. And what sort of lively lads with the
      pencil those Chinese are, many queer cups and saucers inform us.
      
      As for the sign-painters’ whales seen in the streets hanging over the
      shops of oil-dealers, what shall be said of them? They are generally
      Richard III. whales, with dromedary humps, and very savage;
      breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts, that is whaleboats full of
      mariners: their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue
      paint.
      
      But these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very
      surprising after all. Consider! Most of the scientific drawings have
      been taken from the stranded fish; and these are about as correct as a
      drawing of a wrecked ship, with broken back, would correctly represent
      the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars.
      Though elephants have stood for their full-lengths, the living
      Leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait. The
      living whale, in his full majesty and significance, is only to be seen
      at sea in unfathomable waters; and afloat the vast bulk of him is out
      of sight, like a launched line-of-battle ship; and out of that element
      it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily
      into the air, so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations.
      And, not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour
      between a young sucking whale and a full-grown Platonian Leviathan;
      yet, even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a
      ship’s deck, such is then the outlandish, eel-like, limbered, varying
      shape of him, that his precise expression the devil himself could not
      catch.
      
      But it may be fancied, that from the naked skeleton of the stranded
      whale, accurate hints may be derived touching his true form. Not at
      all. For it is one of the more curious things about this Leviathan,
      that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape. Though
      Jeremy Bentham’s skeleton, which hangs for candelabra in the library of
      one of his executors, correctly conveys the idea of a burly-browed
      utilitarian old gentleman, with all Jeremy’s other leading personal
      characteristics; yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any
      leviathan’s articulated bones. In fact, as the great Hunter says, the
      mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully
      invested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so
      roundingly envelopes it. This peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the
      head, as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown. It is
      also very curiously displayed in the side fin, the bones of which
      almost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand, minus only the
      thumb. This fin has four regular bone-fingers, the index, middle, ring,
      and little finger. But all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy
      covering, as the human fingers in an artificial covering. “However
      recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us,” said humorous Stubb one
      day, “he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens.”
      
      For all these reasons, then, any way you may look at it, you must needs
      conclude that the great Leviathan is that one creature in the world
      which must remain unpainted to the last. True, one portrait may hit the
      mark much nearer than another, but none can hit it with any very
      considerable degree of exactness. So there is no earthly way of finding
      out precisely what the whale really looks like. And the only mode in
      which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour, is by
      going a whaling yourself; but by so doing, you run no small risk of
      being eternally stove and sunk by him. Wherefore, it seems to me you
      had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this
      Leviathan.
      
      
      CHAPTER 56. Of the Less Erroneous Pictures of Whales, and the True
      Pictures of Whaling Scenes.
      
      In connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales, I am strongly
      tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them
      which are to be found in certain books, both ancient and modern,
      especially in Pliny, Purchas, Hackluyt, Harris, Cuvier, etc. But I pass
      that matter by.
      
      I know of only four published outlines of the great Sperm Whale;
      Colnett’s, Huggins’s, Frederick Cuvier’s, and Beale’s. In the previous
      chapter Colnett and Cuvier have been referred to. Huggins’s is far
      better than theirs; but, by great odds, Beale’s is the best. All
      Beale’s drawings of this whale are good, excepting the middle figure in
      the picture of three whales in various attitudes, capping his second
      chapter. His frontispiece, boats attacking Sperm Whales, though no
      doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men, is
      admirably correct and life-like in its general effect. Some of the
      Sperm Whale drawings in J. Ross Browne are pretty correct in contour;
      but they are wretchedly engraved. That is not his fault though.
      
      Of the Right Whale, the best outline pictures are in Scoresby; but they
      are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression. He has
      but one picture of whaling scenes, and this is a sad deficiency,
      because it is by such pictures only, when at all well done, that you
      can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by
      his living hunters.
      
      But, taken for all in all, by far the finest, though in some details
      not the most correct, presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be
      anywhere found, are two large French engravings, well executed, and
      taken from paintings by one Garnery. Respectively, they represent
      attacks on the Sperm and Right Whale. In the first engraving a noble
      Sperm Whale is depicted in full majesty of might, just risen beneath
      the boat from the profundities of the ocean, and bearing high in the
      air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks. The prow of
      the boat is partially unbroken, and is drawn just balancing upon the
      monster’s spine; and standing in that prow, for that one single
      incomputable flash of time, you behold an oarsman, half shrouded by the
      incensed boiling spout of the whale, and in the act of leaping, as if
      from a precipice. The action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and
      true. The half-emptied line-tub floats on the whitened sea; the wooden
      poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it; the heads of the
      swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions
      of affright; while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing
      down upon the scene. Serious fault might be found with the anatomical
      details of this whale, but let that pass; since, for the life of me, I
      could not draw so good a one.
      
      In the second engraving, the boat is in the act of drawing alongside
      the barnacled flank of a large running Right Whale, that rolls his
      black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rock-slide from the
      Patagonian cliffs. His jets are erect, full, and black like soot; so
      that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney, you would think there
      must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below. Sea fowls are
      pecking at the small crabs, shell-fish, and other sea candies and
      maccaroni, which the Right Whale sometimes carries on his pestilent
      back. And all the while the thick-lipped leviathan is rushing through
      the deep, leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake, and
      causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh
      the paddle-wheels of an ocean steamer. Thus, the foreground is all
      raging commotion; but behind, in admirable artistic contrast, is the
      glassy level of a sea becalmed, the drooping unstarched sails of the
      powerless ship, and the inert mass of a dead whale, a conquered
      fortress, with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whale-pole
      inserted into his spout-hole.
      
      Who Garnery the painter is, or was, I know not. But my life for it he
      was either practically conversant with his subject, or else
      marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman. The French are the
      lads for painting action. Go and gaze upon all the paintings of Europe,
      and where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing
      commotion on canvas, as in that triumphal hall at Versailles; where the
      beholder fights his way, pell-mell, through the consecutive great
      battles of France; where every sword seems a flash of the Northern
      Lights, and the successive armed kings and Emperors dash by, like a
      charge of crowned centaurs? Not wholly unworthy of a place in that
      gallery, are these sea battle-pieces of Garnery.
      
      The natural aptitude of the French for seizing the picturesqueness of
      things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings
      they have of their whaling scenes. With not one tenth of England’s
      experience in the fishery, and not the thousandth part of that of the
      Americans, they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only
      finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the
      whale hunt. For the most part, the English and American whale
      draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical
      outline of things, such as the vacant profile of the whale; which, so
      far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned, is about tantamount to
      sketching the profile of a pyramid. Even Scoresby, the justly renowned
      Right whaleman, after giving us a stiff full length of the Greenland
      whale, and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and
      porpoises, treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks,
      chopping knives, and grapnels; and with the microscopic diligence of a
      Leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninety-six
      fac-similes of magnified Arctic snow crystals. I mean no disparagement
      to the excellent voyager (I honor him for a veteran), but in so
      important a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured
      for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a Greenland Justice of
      the Peace.
      
      In addition to those fine engravings from Garnery, there are two other
      French engravings worthy of note, by some one who subscribes himself
      “H. Durand.” One of them, though not precisely adapted to our present
      purpose, nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts. It is a quiet
      noon-scene among the isles of the Pacific; a French whaler anchored,
      inshore, in a calm, and lazily taking water on board; the loosened
      sails of the ship, and the long leaves of the palms in the background,
      both drooping together in the breezeless air. The effect is very fine,
      when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen
      under one of their few aspects of oriental repose. The other engraving
      is quite a different affair: the ship hove-to upon the open sea, and in
      the very heart of the Leviathanic life, with a Right Whale alongside;
      the vessel (in the act of cutting-in) hove over to the monster as if to
      a quay; and a boat, hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity,
      is about giving chase to whales in the distance. The harpoons and
      lances lie levelled for use; three oarsmen are just setting the mast in
      its hole; while from a sudden roll of the sea, the little craft stands
      half-erect out of the water, like a rearing horse. From the ship, the
      smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke
      over a village of smithies; and to windward, a black cloud, rising up
      with earnest of squalls and rains, seems to quicken the activity of the
      excited seamen.
      
      
      CHAPTER 57. Of Whales in Paint; in Teeth; in Wood; in Sheet-Iron; in
      Stone; in Mountains; in Stars.
      
      On Tower-hill, as you go down to the London docks, you may have seen a
      crippled beggar (or _kedger_, as the sailors say) holding a painted
      board before him, representing the tragic scene in which he lost his
      leg. There are three whales and three boats; and one of the boats
      (presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity) is
      being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale. Any time these ten
      years, they tell me, has that man held up that picture, and exhibited
      that stump to an incredulous world. But the time of his justification
      has now come. His three whales are as good whales as were ever
      published in Wapping, at any rate; and his stump as unquestionable a
      stump as any you will find in the western clearings. But, though for
      ever mounted on that stump, never a stump-speech does the poor whaleman
      make; but, with downcast eyes, stands ruefully contemplating his own
      amputation.
      
      Throughout the Pacific, and also in Nantucket, and New Bedford, and Sag
      Harbor, you will come across lively sketches of whales and
      whaling-scenes, graven by the fishermen themselves on Sperm
      Whale-teeth, or ladies’ busks wrought out of the Right Whale-bone, and
      other like skrimshander articles, as the whalemen call the numerous
      little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough
      material, in their hours of ocean leisure. Some of them have little
      boxes of dentistical-looking implements, specially intended for the
      skrimshandering business. But, in general, they toil with their
      jack-knives alone; and, with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor,
      they will turn you out anything you please, in the way of a mariner’s
      fancy.
      
      Long exile from Christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man
      to that condition in which God placed him, _i.e._ what is called
      savagery. Your true whale-hunter is as much a savage as an Iroquois. I
      myself am a savage, owning no allegiance but to the King of the
      Cannibals; and ready at any moment to rebel against him.
      
      Now, one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic
      hours, is his wonderful patience of industry. An ancient Hawaiian
      war-club or spear-paddle, in its full multiplicity and elaboration of
      carving, is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a Latin lexicon.
      For, with but a bit of broken sea-shell or a shark’s tooth, that
      miraculous intricacy of wooden net-work has been achieved; and it has
      cost steady years of steady application.
      
      As with the Hawaiian savage, so with the white sailor-savage. With the
      same marvellous patience, and with the same single shark’s tooth, of
      his one poor jack-knife, he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture, not
      quite as workmanlike, but as close packed in its maziness of design, as
      the Greek savage, Achilles’s shield; and full of barbaric spirit and
      suggestiveness, as the prints of that fine old Dutch savage, Albert
      Durer.
      
      Wooden whales, or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of
      the noble South Sea war-wood, are frequently met with in the
      forecastles of American whalers. Some of them are done with much
      accuracy.
      
      At some old gable-roofed country houses you will see brass whales hung
      by the tail for knockers to the road-side door. When the porter is
      sleepy, the anvil-headed whale would be best. But these knocking whales
      are seldom remarkable as faithful essays. On the spires of some
      old-fashioned churches you will see sheet-iron whales placed there for
      weather-cocks; but they are so elevated, and besides that are to all
      intents and purposes so labelled with “_Hands off!_” you cannot examine
      them closely enough to decide upon their merit.
      
      In bony, ribby regions of the earth, where at the base of high broken
      cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain,
      you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the
      Leviathan partly merged in grass, which of a windy day breaks against
      them in a surf of green surges.
      
      Then, again, in mountainous countries where the traveller is
      continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights; here and there from
      some lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the
      profiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges. But you must be
      a thorough whaleman, to see these sights; and not only that, but if you
      wish to return to such a sight again, you must be sure and take the
      exact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first stand-point,
      else so chance-like are such observations of the hills, that your
      precise, previous stand-point would require a laborious re-discovery;
      like the Soloma Islands, which still remain incognita, though once
      high-ruffed Mendanna trod them and old Figuera chronicled them.
      
      Nor when expandingly lifted by your subject, can you fail to trace out
      great whales in the starry heavens, and boats in pursuit of them; as
      when long filled with thoughts of war the Eastern nations saw armies
      locked in battle among the clouds. Thus at the North have I chased
      Leviathan round and round the Pole with the revolutions of the bright
      points that first defined him to me. And beneath the effulgent
      Antarctic skies I have boarded the Argo-Navis, and joined the chase
      against the starry Cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of Hydrus and
      the Flying Fish.
      
      With a frigate’s anchors for my bridle-bitts and fasces of harpoons for
      spurs, would I could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies, to
      see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really
      lie encamped beyond my mortal sight!
      
      
      CHAPTER 58. Brit.
      
      Steering north-eastward from the Crozetts, we fell in with vast meadows
      of brit, the minute, yellow substance, upon which the Right Whale
      largely feeds. For leagues and leagues it undulated round us, so that
      we seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden
      wheat.
      
      On the second day, numbers of Right Whales were seen, who, secure from
      the attack of a Sperm Whaler like the Pequod, with open jaws sluggishly
      swam through the brit, which, adhering to the fringing fibres of that
      wondrous Venetian blind in their mouths, was in that manner separated
      from the water that escaped at the lip.
      
      As morning mowers, who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their
      scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads; even so these
      monsters swam, making a strange, grassy, cutting sound; and leaving
      behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea.*
      
      *That part of the sea known among whalemen as the “Brazil Banks” does
      not bear that name as the Banks of Newfoundland do, because of there
      being shallows and soundings there, but because of this remarkable
      meadow-like appearance, caused by the vast drifts of brit continually
      floating in those latitudes, where the Right Whale is often chased.
      
      But it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at
      all reminded one of mowers. Seen from the mast-heads, especially when
      they paused and were stationary for a while, their vast black forms
      looked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else. And as in
      the great hunting countries of India, the stranger at a distance will
      sometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them
      to be such, taking them for bare, blackened elevations of the soil;
      even so, often, with him, who for the first time beholds this species
      of the leviathans of the sea. And even when recognised at last, their
      immense magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such
      bulky masses of overgrowth can possibly be instinct, in all parts, with
      the same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse.
      
      Indeed, in other respects, you can hardly regard any creatures of the
      deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore. For though
      some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are
      of their kind in the sea; and though taking a broad general view of the
      thing, this may very well be; yet coming to specialties, where, for
      example, does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to
      the sagacious kindness of the dog? The accursed shark alone can in any
      generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him.
      
      But though, to landsmen in general, the native inhabitants of the seas
      have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and
      repelling; though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita,
      so that Columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his
      one superficial western one; though, by vast odds, the most terrific of
      all mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen
      tens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters;
      though but a moment’s consideration will teach, that however baby man
      may brag of his science and skill, and however much, in a flattering
      future, that science and skill may augment; yet for ever and for ever,
      to the crack of doom, the sea will insult and murder him, and pulverize
      the stateliest, stiffest frigate he can make; nevertheless, by the
      continual repetition of these very impressions, man has lost that sense
      of the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it.
      
      The first boat we read of, floated on an ocean, that with Portuguese
      vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow.
      That same ocean rolls now; that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships
      of last year. Yea, foolish mortals, Noah’s flood is not yet subsided;
      two thirds of the fair world it yet covers.
      
      Wherein differ the sea and the land, that a miracle upon one is not a
      miracle upon the other? Preternatural terrors rested upon the Hebrews,
      when under the feet of Korah and his company the live ground opened and
      swallowed them up for ever; yet not a modern sun ever sets, but in
      precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews.
      
      But not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it, but it
      is also a fiend to its own off-spring; worse than the Persian host who
      murdered his own guests; sparing not the creatures which itself hath
      spawned. Like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her
      own cubs, so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the
      rocks, and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of
      ships. No mercy, no power but its own controls it. Panting and snorting
      like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider, the masterless ocean
      overruns the globe.
      
      Consider the subtleness of the sea; how its most dreaded creatures
      glide under water, unapparent for the most part, and treacherously
      hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure. Consider also the devilish
      brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes, as the
      dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks. Consider, once
      more, the universal cannibalism of the sea; all whose creatures prey
      upon each other, carrying on eternal war since the world began.
      
      Consider all this; and then turn to this green, gentle, and most docile
      earth; consider them both, the sea and the land; and do you not find a
      strange analogy to something in yourself? For as this appalling ocean
      surrounds the verdant land, so in the soul of man there lies one
      insular Tahiti, full of peace and joy, but encompassed by all the
      horrors of the half known life. God keep thee! Push not off from that
      isle, thou canst never return!
      
      
      CHAPTER 59. Squid.
      
      Slowly wading through the meadows of brit, the Pequod still held on her
      way north-eastward towards the island of Java; a gentle air impelling
      her keel, so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering
      masts mildly waved to that languid breeze, as three mild palms on a
      plain. And still, at wide intervals in the silvery night, the lonely,
      alluring jet would be seen.
      
      But one transparent blue morning, when a stillness almost preternatural
      spread over the sea, however unattended with any stagnant calm; when
      the long burnished sun-glade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid
      across them, enjoining some secrecy; when the slippered waves whispered
      together as they softly ran on; in this profound hush of the visible
      sphere a strange spectre was seen by Daggoo from the main-mast-head.
      
      In the distance, a great white mass lazily rose, and rising higher and
      higher, and disentangling itself from the azure, at last gleamed before
      our prow like a snow-slide, new slid from the hills. Thus glistening
      for a moment, as slowly it subsided, and sank. Then once more arose,
      and silently gleamed. It seemed not a whale; and yet is this Moby Dick?
      thought Daggoo. Again the phantom went down, but on re-appearing once
      more, with a stiletto-like cry that startled every man from his nod,
      the negro yelled out—“There! there again! there she breaches! right
      ahead! The White Whale, the White Whale!”
      
      Upon this, the seamen rushed to the yard-arms, as in swarming-time the
      bees rush to the boughs. Bare-headed in the sultry sun, Ahab stood on
      the bowsprit, and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave
      his orders to the helmsman, cast his eager glance in the direction
      indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of Daggoo.
      
      Whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had
      gradually worked upon Ahab, so that he was now prepared to connect the
      ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular
      whale he pursued; however this was, or whether his eagerness betrayed
      him; whichever way it might have been, no sooner did he distinctly
      perceive the white mass, than with a quick intensity he instantly gave
      orders for lowering.
      
      The four boats were soon on the water; Ahab’s in advance, and all
      swiftly pulling towards their prey. Soon it went down, and while, with
      oars suspended, we were awaiting its reappearance, lo! in the same spot
      where it sank, once more it slowly rose. Almost forgetting for the
      moment all thoughts of Moby Dick, we now gazed at the most wondrous
      phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind. A
      vast pulpy mass, furlongs in length and breadth, of a glancing
      cream-colour, lay floating on the water, innumerable long arms
      radiating from its centre, and curling and twisting like a nest of
      anacondas, as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach.
      No perceptible face or front did it have; no conceivable token of
      either sensation or instinct; but undulated there on the billows, an
      unearthly, formless, chance-like apparition of life.
      
      As with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again, Starbuck still
      gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk, with a wild voice
      exclaimed—“Almost rather had I seen Moby Dick and fought him, than to
      have seen thee, thou white ghost!”
      
      “What was it, Sir?” said Flask.
      
      “The great live squid, which, they say, few whale-ships ever beheld,
      and returned to their ports to tell of it.”
      
      But Ahab said nothing; turning his boat, he sailed back to the vessel;
      the rest as silently following.
      
      Whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected
      with the sight of this object, certain it is, that a glimpse of it
      being so very unusual, that circumstance has gone far to invest it with
      portentousness. So rarely is it beheld, that though one and all of them
      declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean, yet very few
      of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature
      and form; notwithstanding, they believe it to furnish to the sperm
      whale his only food. For though other species of whales find their food
      above water, and may be seen by man in the act of feeding, the
      spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the
      surface; and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what,
      precisely, that food consists. At times, when closely pursued, he will
      disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid; some
      of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length. They
      fancy that the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings
      by them to the bed of the ocean; and that the sperm whale, unlike other
      species, is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it.
      
      There seems some ground to imagine that the great Kraken of Bishop
      Pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into Squid. The manner in
      which the Bishop describes it, as alternately rising and sinking, with
      some other particulars he narrates, in all this the two correspond. But
      much abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he
      assigns it.
      
      By some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious
      creature, here spoken of, it is included among the class of
      cuttle-fish, to which, indeed, in certain external respects it would
      seem to belong, but only as the Anak of the tribe.
      
      
      CHAPTER 60. The Line.
      
      With reference to the whaling scene shortly to be described, as well as
      for the better understanding of all similar scenes elsewhere presented,
      I have here to speak of the magical, sometimes horrible whale-line.
      
      The line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp, slightly
      vapored with tar, not impregnated with it, as in the case of ordinary
      ropes; for while tar, as ordinarily used, makes the hemp more pliable
      to the rope-maker, and also renders the rope itself more convenient to
      the sailor for common ship use; yet, not only would the ordinary
      quantity too much stiffen the whale-line for the close coiling to which
      it must be subjected; but as most seamen are beginning to learn, tar in
      general by no means adds to the rope’s durability or strength, however
      much it may give it compactness and gloss.
      
      Of late years the Manilla rope has in the American fishery almost
      entirely superseded hemp as a material for whale-lines; for, though not
      so durable as hemp, it is stronger, and far more soft and elastic; and
      I will add (since there is an æsthetics in all things), is much more
      handsome and becoming to the boat, than hemp. Hemp is a dusky, dark
      fellow, a sort of Indian; but Manilla is as a golden-haired Circassian
      to behold.
      
      The whale-line is only two-thirds of an inch in thickness. At first
      sight, you would not think it so strong as it really is. By experiment
      its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and
      twenty pounds; so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal
      to three tons. In length, the common sperm whale-line measures
      something over two hundred fathoms. Towards the stern of the boat it is
      spirally coiled away in the tub, not like the worm-pipe of a still
      though, but so as to form one round, cheese-shaped mass of densely
      bedded “sheaves,” or layers of concentric spiralizations, without any
      hollow but the “heart,” or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of
      the cheese. As the least tangle or kink in the coiling would, in
      running out, infallibly take somebody’s arm, leg, or entire body off,
      the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub. Some
      harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business,
      carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a
      block towards the tub, so as in the act of coiling to free it from all
      possible wrinkles and twists.
      
      In the English boats two tubs are used instead of one; the same line
      being continuously coiled in both tubs. There is some advantage in
      this; because these twin-tubs being so small they fit more readily into
      the boat, and do not strain it so much; whereas, the American tub,
      nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth, makes a
      rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one half-inch in
      thickness; for the bottom of the whale-boat is like critical ice, which
      will bear up a considerable distributed weight, but not very much of a
      concentrated one. When the painted canvas cover is clapped on the
      American line-tub, the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a
      prodigious great wedding-cake to present to the whales.
      
      Both ends of the line are exposed; the lower end terminating in an
      eye-splice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the
      tub, and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything.
      This arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts. First:
      In order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a
      neighboring boat, in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to
      threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the
      harpoon. In these instances, the whale of course is shifted like a mug
      of ale, as it were, from the one boat to the other; though the first
      boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort. Second: This
      arrangement is indispensable for common safety’s sake; for were the
      lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat, and were the
      whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single, smoking
      minute as he sometimes does, he would not stop there, for the doomed
      boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of
      the sea; and in that case no town-crier would ever find her again.
      
      Before lowering the boat for the chase, the upper end of the line is
      taken aft from the tub, and passing round the loggerhead there, is
      again carried forward the entire length of the boat, resting crosswise
      upon the loom or handle of every man’s oar, so that it jogs against his
      wrist in rowing; and also passing between the men, as they alternately
      sit at the opposite gunwales, to the leaded chocks or grooves in the
      extreme pointed prow of the boat, where a wooden pin or skewer the size
      of a common quill, prevents it from slipping out. From the chocks it
      hangs in a slight festoon over the bows, and is then passed inside the
      boat again; and some ten or twenty fathoms (called box-line) being
      coiled upon the box in the bows, it continues its way to the gunwale
      still a little further aft, and is then attached to the short-warp—the
      rope which is immediately connected with the harpoon; but previous to
      that connexion, the short-warp goes through sundry mystifications too
      tedious to detail.
      
      Thus the whale-line folds the whole boat in its complicated coils,
      twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction. All the
      oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions; so that to the timid
      eye of the landsman, they seem as Indian jugglers, with the deadliest
      snakes sportively festooning their limbs. Nor can any son of mortal
      woman, for the first time, seat himself amid those hempen intricacies,
      and while straining his utmost at the oar, bethink him that at any
      unknown instant the harpoon may be darted, and all these horrible
      contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings; he cannot be thus
      circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones
      to quiver in him like a shaken jelly. Yet habit—strange thing! what
      cannot habit accomplish?—Gayer sallies, more merry mirth, better jokes,
      and brighter repartees, you never heard over your mahogany, than you
      will hear over the half-inch white cedar of the whale-boat, when thus
      hung in hangman’s nooses; and, like the six burghers of Calais before
      King Edward, the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of
      death, with a halter around every neck, as you may say.
      
      Perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those
      repeated whaling disasters—some few of which are casually chronicled—of
      this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line, and lost.
      For, when the line is darting out, to be seated then in the boat, is
      like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a
      steam-engine in full play, when every flying beam, and shaft, and
      wheel, is grazing you. It is worse; for you cannot sit motionless in
      the heart of these perils, because the boat is rocking like a cradle,
      and you are pitched one way and the other, without the slightest
      warning; and only by a certain self-adjusting buoyancy and
      simultaneousness of volition and action, can you escape being made a
      Mazeppa of, and run away with where the all-seeing sun himself could
      never pierce you out.
      
      Again: as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and
      prophesies of the storm, is perhaps more awful than the storm itself;
      for, indeed, the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm; and
      contains it in itself, as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal
      powder, and the ball, and the explosion; so the graceful repose of the
      line, as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought
      into actual play—this is a thing which carries more of true terror than
      any other aspect of this dangerous affair. But why say more? All men
      live enveloped in whale-lines. All are born with halters round their
      necks; but it is only when caught in the swift, sudden turn of death,
      that mortals realize the silent, subtle, ever-present perils of life.
      And if you be a philosopher, though seated in the whale-boat, you would
      not at heart feel one whit more of terror, than though seated before
      your evening fire with a poker, and not a harpoon, by your side.
      
      
      CHAPTER 61. Stubb Kills a Whale.
      
      If to Starbuck the apparition of the Squid was a thing of portents, to
      Queequeg it was quite a different object.
      
      “When you see him ’quid,” said the savage, honing his harpoon in the
      bow of his hoisted boat, “then you quick see him ’parm whale.”
      
      The next day was exceedingly still and sultry, and with nothing special
      to engage them, the Pequod’s crew could hardly resist the spell of
      sleep induced by such a vacant sea. For this part of the Indian Ocean
      through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively
      ground; that is, it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises, dolphins,
      flying-fish, and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters, than
      those off the Rio de la Plata, or the in-shore ground off Peru.
      
      It was my turn to stand at the foremast-head; and with my shoulders
      leaning against the slackened royal shrouds, to and fro I idly swayed
      in what seemed an enchanted air. No resolution could withstand it; in
      that dreamy mood losing all consciousness, at last my soul went out of
      my body; though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will,
      long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn.
      
      Ere forgetfulness altogether came over me, I had noticed that the
      seamen at the main and mizzen-mast-heads were already drowsy. So that
      at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars, and for every
      swing that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering
      helmsman. The waves, too, nodded their indolent crests; and across the
      wide trance of the sea, east nodded to west, and the sun over all.
      
      Suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes; like vices my
      hands grasped the shrouds; some invisible, gracious agency preserved
      me; with a shock I came back to life. And lo! close under our lee, not
      forty fathoms off, a gigantic Sperm Whale lay rolling in the water like
      the capsized hull of a frigate, his broad, glossy back, of an Ethiopian
      hue, glistening in the sun’s rays like a mirror. But lazily undulating
      in the trough of the sea, and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his
      vapory jet, the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of
      a warm afternoon. But that pipe, poor whale, was thy last. As if struck
      by some enchanter’s wand, the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all
      at once started into wakefulness; and more than a score of voices from
      all parts of the vessel, simultaneously with the three notes from
      aloft, shouted forth the accustomed cry, as the great fish slowly and
      regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air.
      
      “Clear away the boats! Luff!” cried Ahab. And obeying his own order, he
      dashed the helm down before the helmsman could handle the spokes.
      
      The sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale; and
      ere the boats were down, majestically turning, he swam away to the
      leeward, but with such a steady tranquillity, and making so few ripples
      as he swam, that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed,
      Ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used, and no man must speak
      but in whispers. So seated like Ontario Indians on the gunwales of the
      boats, we swiftly but silently paddled along; the calm not admitting of
      the noiseless sails being set. Presently, as we thus glided in chase,
      the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air,
      and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up.
      
      “There go flukes!” was the cry, an announcement immediately followed by
      Stubb’s producing his match and igniting his pipe, for now a respite
      was granted. After the full interval of his sounding had elapsed, the
      whale rose again, and being now in advance of the smoker’s boat, and
      much nearer to it than to any of the others, Stubb counted upon the
      honor of the capture. It was obvious, now, that the whale had at length
      become aware of his pursuers. All silence of cautiousness was therefore
      no longer of use. Paddles were dropped, and oars came loudly into play.
      And still puffing at his pipe, Stubb cheered on his crew to the
      assault.
      
      Yes, a mighty change had come over the fish. All alive to his jeopardy,
      he was going “head out”; that part obliquely projecting from the mad
      yeast which he brewed.*
      
      *It will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the
      entire interior of the sperm whale’s enormous head consists. Though
      apparently the most massive, it is by far the most buoyant part about
      him. So that with ease he elevates it in the air, and invariably does
      so when going at his utmost speed. Besides, such is the breadth of the
      upper part of the front of his head, and such the tapering cut-water
      formation of the lower part, that by obliquely elevating his head, he
      thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluff-bowed sluggish
      galliot into a sharppointed New York pilot-boat.
      
      “Start her, start her, my men! Don’t hurry yourselves; take plenty of
      time—but start her; start her like thunder-claps, that’s all,” cried
      Stubb, spluttering out the smoke as he spoke. “Start her, now; give ’em
      the long and strong stroke, Tashtego. Start her, Tash, my boy—start
      her, all; but keep cool, keep cool—cucumbers is the word—easy,
      easy—only start her like grim death and grinning devils, and raise the
      buried dead perpendicular out of their graves, boys—that’s all. Start
      her!”
      
      “Woo-hoo! Wa-hee!” screamed the Gay-Header in reply, raising some old
      war-whoop to the skies; as every oarsman in the strained boat
      involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke
      which the eager Indian gave.
      
      But his wild screams were answered by others quite as wild. “Kee-hee!
      Kee-hee!” yelled Daggoo, straining forwards and backwards on his seat,
      like a pacing tiger in his cage.
      
      “Ka-la! Koo-loo!” howled Queequeg, as if smacking his lips over a
      mouthful of Grenadier’s steak. And thus with oars and yells the keels
      cut the sea. Meanwhile, Stubb retaining his place in the van, still
      encouraged his men to the onset, all the while puffing the smoke from
      his mouth. Like desperadoes they tugged and they strained, till the
      welcome cry was heard—“Stand up, Tashtego!—give it to him!” The harpoon
      was hurled. “Stern all!” The oarsmen backed water; the same moment
      something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists. It was
      the magical line. An instant before, Stubb had swiftly caught two
      additional turns with it round the loggerhead, whence, by reason of its
      increased rapid circlings, a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and
      mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe. As the line passed round
      and round the loggerhead; so also, just before reaching that point, it
      blisteringly passed through and through both of Stubb’s hands, from
      which the hand-cloths, or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at
      these times, had accidentally dropped. It was like holding an enemy’s
      sharp two-edged sword by the blade, and that enemy all the time
      striving to wrest it out of your clutch.
      
      “Wet the line! wet the line!” cried Stubb to the tub oarsman (him
      seated by the tub) who, snatching off his hat, dashed sea-water into
      it.* More turns were taken, so that the line began holding its place.
      The boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins.
      Stubb and Tashtego here changed places—stem for stern—a staggering
      business truly in that rocking commotion.
      
      *Partly to show the indispensableness of this act, it may here be
      stated, that, in the old Dutch fishery, a mop was used to dash the
      running line with water; in many other ships, a wooden piggin, or
      bailer, is set apart for that purpose. Your hat, however, is the most
      convenient.
      
      From the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part
      of the boat, and from its now being more tight than a harpstring, you
      would have thought the craft had two keels—one cleaving the water, the
      other the air—as the boat churned on through both opposing elements at
      once. A continual cascade played at the bows; a ceaseless whirling eddy
      in her wake; and, at the slightest motion from within, even but of a
      little finger, the vibrating, cracking craft canted over her spasmodic
      gunwale into the sea. Thus they rushed; each man with might and main
      clinging to his seat, to prevent being tossed to the foam; and the tall
      form of Tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double, in order
      to bring down his centre of gravity. Whole Atlantics and Pacifics
      seemed passed as they shot on their way, till at length the whale
      somewhat slackened his flight.
      
      “Haul in—haul in!” cried Stubb to the bowsman! and, facing round
      towards the whale, all hands began pulling the boat up to him, while
      yet the boat was being towed on. Soon ranging up by his flank, Stubb,
      firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat, darted dart after dart
      into the flying fish; at the word of command, the boat alternately
      sterning out of the way of the whale’s horrible wallow, and then
      ranging up for another fling.
      
      The red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down
      a hill. His tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood, which
      bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake. The slanting sun
      playing upon this crimson pond in the sea, sent back its reflection
      into every face, so that they all glowed to each other like red men.
      And all the while, jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot
      from the spiracle of the whale, and vehement puff after puff from the
      mouth of the excited headsman; as at every dart, hauling in upon his
      crooked lance (by the line attached to it), Stubb straightened it again
      and again, by a few rapid blows against the gunwale, then again and
      again sent it into the whale.
      
      “Pull up—pull up!” he now cried to the bowsman, as the waning whale
      relaxed in his wrath. “Pull up!—close to!” and the boat ranged along
      the fish’s flank. When reaching far over the bow, Stubb slowly churned
      his long sharp lance into the fish, and kept it there, carefully
      churning and churning, as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold
      watch that the whale might have swallowed, and which he was fearful of
      breaking ere he could hook it out. But that gold watch he sought was
      the innermost life of the fish. And now it is struck; for, starting
      from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his “flurry,” the
      monster horribly wallowed in his blood, overwrapped himself in
      impenetrable, mad, boiling spray, so that the imperilled craft,
      instantly dropping astern, had much ado blindly to struggle out from
      that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day.
      
      And now abating in his flurry, the whale once more rolled out into
      view; surging from side to side; spasmodically dilating and contracting
      his spout-hole, with sharp, cracking, agonized respirations. At last,
      gush after gush of clotted red gore, as if it had been the purple lees
      of red wine, shot into the frighted air; and falling back again, ran
      dripping down his motionless flanks into the sea. His heart had burst!
      
      “He’s dead, Mr. Stubb,” said Daggoo.
      
      “Yes; both pipes smoked out!” and withdrawing his own from his mouth,
      Stubb scattered the dead ashes over the water; and, for a moment, stood
      thoughtfully eyeing the vast corpse he had made.
      
      
      CHAPTER 62. The Dart.
      
      A word concerning an incident in the last chapter.
      
      According to the invariable usage of the fishery, the whale-boat pushes
      off from the ship, with the headsman or whale-killer as temporary
      steersman, and the harpooneer or whale-fastener pulling the foremost
      oar, the one known as the harpooneer-oar. Now it needs a strong,
      nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish; for often, in what
      is called a long dart, the heavy implement has to be flung to the
      distance of twenty or thirty feet. But however prolonged and exhausting
      the chase, the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the
      uttermost; indeed, he is expected to set an example of superhuman
      activity to the rest, not only by incredible rowing, but by repeated
      loud and intrepid exclamations; and what it is to keep shouting at the
      top of one’s compass, while all the other muscles are strained and half
      started—what that is none know but those who have tried it. For one, I
      cannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same
      time. In this straining, bawling state, then, with his back to the
      fish, all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting
      cry—“Stand up, and give it to him!” He now has to drop and secure his
      oar, turn round on his centre half way, seize his harpoon from the
      crotch, and with what little strength may remain, he essays to pitch it
      somehow into the whale. No wonder, taking the whole fleet of whalemen
      in a body, that out of fifty fair chances for a dart, not five are
      successful; no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed
      and disrated; no wonder that some of them actually burst their
      blood-vessels in the boat; no wonder that some sperm whalemen are
      absent four years with four barrels; no wonder that to many ship
      owners, whaling is but a losing concern; for it is the harpooneer that
      makes the voyage, and if you take the breath out of his body how can
      you expect to find it there when most wanted!
      
      Again, if the dart be successful, then at the second critical instant,
      that is, when the whale starts to run, the boatheader and harpooneer
      likewise start to running fore and aft, to the imminent jeopardy of
      themselves and every one else. It is then they change places; and the
      headsman, the chief officer of the little craft, takes his proper
      station in the bows of the boat.
      
      Now, I care not who maintains the contrary, but all this is both
      foolish and unnecessary. The headsman should stay in the bows from
      first to last; he should both dart the harpoon and the lance, and no
      rowing whatever should be expected of him, except under circumstances
      obvious to any fisherman. I know that this would sometimes involve a
      slight loss of speed in the chase; but long experience in various
      whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast
      majority of failures in the fishery, it has not by any means been so
      much the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the
      harpooneer that has caused them.
      
      To insure the greatest efficiency in the dart, the harpooneers of this
      world must start to their feet from out of idleness, and not from out
      of toil.
      
      
      CHAPTER 63. The Crotch.
      
      Out of the trunk, the branches grow; out of them, the twigs. So, in
      productive subjects, grow the chapters.
      
      The crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention.
      It is a notched stick of a peculiar form, some two feet in length,
      which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the
      bow, for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of
      the harpoon, whose other naked, barbed end slopingly projects from the
      prow. Thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler, who
      snatches it up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his
      rifle from the wall. It is customary to have two harpoons reposing in
      the crotch, respectively called the first and second irons.
      
      But these two harpoons, each by its own cord, are both connected with
      the line; the object being this: to dart them both, if possible, one
      instantly after the other into the same whale; so that if, in the
      coming drag, one should draw out, the other may still retain a hold. It
      is a doubling of the chances. But it very often happens that owing to
      the instantaneous, violent, convulsive running of the whale upon
      receiving the first iron, it becomes impossible for the harpooneer,
      however lightning-like in his movements, to pitch the second iron into
      him. Nevertheless, as the second iron is already connected with the
      line, and the line is running, hence that weapon must, at all events,
      be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat, somehow and somewhere; else
      the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands. Tumbled into the
      water, it accordingly is in such cases; the spare coils of box line
      (mentioned in a preceding chapter) making this feat, in most instances,
      prudently practicable. But this critical act is not always unattended
      with the saddest and most fatal casualties.
      
      Furthermore: you must know that when the second iron is thrown
      overboard, it thenceforth becomes a dangling, sharp-edged terror,
      skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale, entangling the lines,
      or cutting them, and making a prodigious sensation in all directions.
      Nor, in general, is it possible to secure it again until the whale is
      fairly captured and a corpse.
      
      Consider, now, how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging
      one unusually strong, active, and knowing whale; when owing to these
      qualities in him, as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of
      such an audacious enterprise, eight or ten loose second irons may be
      simultaneously dangling about him. For, of course, each boat is
      supplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first
      one be ineffectually darted without recovery. All these particulars are
      faithfully narrated here, as they will not fail to elucidate several
      most important, however intricate passages, in scenes hereafter to be
      painted.
      
      
      CHAPTER 64. Stubb’s Supper.
      
      Stubb’s whale had been killed some distance from the ship. It was a
      calm; so, forming a tandem of three boats, we commenced the slow
      business of towing the trophy to the Pequod. And now, as we eighteen
      men with our thirty-six arms, and one hundred and eighty thumbs and
      fingers, slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert, sluggish corpse
      in the sea; and it seemed hardly to budge at all, except at long
      intervals; good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of
      the mass we moved. For, upon the great canal of Hang-Ho, or whatever
      they call it, in China, four or five laborers on the foot-path will
      draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour; but this
      grand argosy we towed heavily forged along, as if laden with pig-lead
      in bulk.
      
      Darkness came on; but three lights up and down in the Pequod’s
      main-rigging dimly guided our way; till drawing nearer we saw Ahab
      dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks. Vacantly
      eyeing the heaving whale for a moment, he issued the usual orders for
      securing it for the night, and then handing his lantern to a seaman,
      went his way into the cabin, and did not come forward again until
      morning.
      
      Though, in overseeing the pursuit of this whale, Captain Ahab had
      evinced his customary activity, to call it so; yet now that the
      creature was dead, some vague dissatisfaction, or impatience, or
      despair, seemed working in him; as if the sight of that dead body
      reminded him that Moby Dick was yet to be slain; and though a thousand
      other whales were brought to his ship, all that would not one jot
      advance his grand, monomaniac object. Very soon you would have thought
      from the sound on the Pequod’s decks, that all hands were preparing to
      cast anchor in the deep; for heavy chains are being dragged along the
      deck, and thrust rattling out of the port-holes. But by those clanking
      links, the vast corpse itself, not the ship, is to be moored. Tied by
      the head to the stern, and by the tail to the bows, the whale now lies
      with its black hull close to the vessel’s and seen through the darkness
      of the night, which obscured the spars and rigging aloft, the two—ship
      and whale, seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks, whereof one
      reclines while the other remains standing.*
      
      *A little item may as well be related here. The strongest and most
      reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside,
      is by the flukes or tail; and as from its greater density that part is
      relatively heavier than any other (excepting the side-fins), its
      flexibility even in death, causes it to sink low beneath the surface;
      so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat, in order to
      put the chain round it. But this difficulty is ingeniously overcome: a
      small, strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end,
      and a weight in its middle, while the other end is secured to the ship.
      By adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side
      of the mass, so that now having girdled the whale, the chain is readily
      made to follow suit; and being slipped along the body, is at last
      locked fast round the smallest part of the tail, at the point of
      junction with its broad flukes or lobes.
      
      If moody Ahab was now all quiescence, at least so far as could be known
      on deck, Stubb, his second mate, flushed with conquest, betrayed an
      unusual but still good-natured excitement. Such an unwonted bustle was
      he in that the staid Starbuck, his official superior, quietly resigned
      to him for the time the sole management of affairs. One small, helping
      cause of all this liveliness in Stubb, was soon made strangely
      manifest. Stubb was a high liver; he was somewhat intemperately fond of
      the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate.
      
      “A steak, a steak, ere I sleep! You, Daggoo! overboard you go, and cut
      me one from his small!”
      
      Here be it known, that though these wild fishermen do not, as a general
      thing, and according to the great military maxim, make the enemy defray
      the current expenses of the war (at least before realizing the proceeds
      of the voyage), yet now and then you find some of these Nantucketers
      who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the Sperm Whale
      designated by Stubb; comprising the tapering extremity of the body.
      
      About midnight that steak was cut and cooked; and lighted by two
      lanterns of sperm oil, Stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper
      at the capstan-head, as if that capstan were a sideboard. Nor was Stubb
      the only banqueter on whale’s flesh that night. Mingling their
      mumblings with his own mastications, thousands on thousands of sharks,
      swarming round the dead leviathan, smackingly feasted on its fatness.
      The few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp
      slapping of their tails against the hull, within a few inches of the
      sleepers’ hearts. Peering over the side you could just see them (as
      before you heard them) wallowing in the sullen, black waters, and
      turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of
      the whale of the bigness of a human head. This particular feat of the
      shark seems all but miraculous. How at such an apparently unassailable
      surface, they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls, remains
      a part of the universal problem of all things. The mark they thus leave
      on the whale, may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in
      countersinking for a screw.
      
      Though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a sea-fight, sharks
      will be seen longingly gazing up to the ship’s decks, like hungry dogs
      round a table where red meat is being carved, ready to bolt down every
      killed man that is tossed to them; and though, while the valiant
      butchers over the deck-table are thus cannibally carving each other’s
      live meat with carving-knives all gilded and tasselled, the sharks,
      also, with their jewel-hilted mouths, are quarrelsomely carving away
      under the table at the dead meat; and though, were you to turn the
      whole affair upside down, it would still be pretty much the same thing,
      that is to say, a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties;
      and though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships
      crossing the Atlantic, systematically trotting alongside, to be handy
      in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere, or a dead slave to be
      decently buried; and though one or two other like instances might be
      set down, touching the set terms, places, and occasions, when sharks do
      most socially congregate, and most hilariously feast; yet is there no
      conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless
      numbers, and in gayer or more jovial spirits, than around a dead sperm
      whale, moored by night to a whaleship at sea. If you have never seen
      that sight, then suspend your decision about the propriety of
      devil-worship, and the expediency of conciliating the devil.
      
      But, as yet, Stubb heeded not the mumblings of the banquet that was
      going on so nigh him, no more than the sharks heeded the smacking of
      his own epicurean lips.
      
      “Cook, cook!—where’s that old Fleece?” he cried at length, widening his
      legs still further, as if to form a more secure base for his supper;
      and, at the same time darting his fork into the dish, as if stabbing
      with his lance; “cook, you cook!—sail this way, cook!”
      
      The old black, not in any very high glee at having been previously
      roused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour, came
      shambling along from his galley, for, like many old blacks, there was
      something the matter with his knee-pans, which he did not keep well
      scoured like his other pans; this old Fleece, as they called him, came
      shuffling and limping along, assisting his step with his tongs, which,
      after a clumsy fashion, were made of straightened iron hoops; this old
      Ebony floundered along, and in obedience to the word of command, came
      to a dead stop on the opposite side of Stubb’s sideboard; when, with
      both hands folded before him, and resting on his two-legged cane, he
      bowed his arched back still further over, at the same time sideways
      inclining his head, so as to bring his best ear into play.
      
      “Cook,” said Stubb, rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his
      mouth, “don’t you think this steak is rather overdone? You’ve been
      beating this steak too much, cook; it’s too tender. Don’t I always say
      that to be good, a whale-steak must be tough? There are those sharks
      now over the side, don’t you see they prefer it tough and rare? What a
      shindy they are kicking up! Cook, go and talk to ’em; tell ’em they are
      welcome to help themselves civilly, and in moderation, but they must
      keep quiet. Blast me, if I can hear my own voice. Away, cook, and
      deliver my message. Here, take this lantern,” snatching one from his
      sideboard; “now then, go and preach to ’em!”
      
      Sullenly taking the offered lantern, old Fleece limped across the deck
      to the bulwarks; and then, with one hand dropping his light low over
      the sea, so as to get a good view of his congregation, with the other
      hand he solemnly flourished his tongs, and leaning far over the side in
      a mumbling voice began addressing the sharks, while Stubb, softly
      crawling behind, overheard all that was said.
      
      “Fellow-critters: I’se ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam
      noise dare. You hear? Stop dat dam smackin’ ob de lip! Massa Stubb say
      dat you can fill your dam bellies up to de hatchings, but by Gor! you
      must stop dat dam racket!”
      
      “Cook,” here interposed Stubb, accompanying the word with a sudden slap
      on the shoulder,—“Cook! why, damn your eyes, you mustn’t swear that way
      when you’re preaching. That’s no way to convert sinners, cook!”
      
      “Who dat? Den preach to him yourself,” sullenly turning to go.
      
      “No, cook; go on, go on.”
      
      “Well, den, Belubed fellow-critters:”—
      
      “Right!” exclaimed Stubb, approvingly, “coax ’em to it; try that,” and
      Fleece continued.
      
      “Do you is all sharks, and by natur wery woracious, yet I zay to you,
      fellow-critters, dat dat woraciousness—’top dat dam slappin’ ob de
      tail! How you tink to hear, spose you keep up such a dam slappin’ and
      bitin’ dare?”
      
      “Cook,” cried Stubb, collaring him, “I won’t have that swearing. Talk
      to ’em gentlemanly.”
      
      Once more the sermon proceeded.
      
      “Your woraciousness, fellow-critters, I don’t blame ye so much for; dat
      is natur, and can’t be helped; but to gobern dat wicked natur, dat is
      de pint. You is sharks, sartin; but if you gobern de shark in you, why
      den you be angel; for all angel is not’ing more dan de shark well
      goberned. Now, look here, bred’ren, just try wonst to be cibil, a
      helping yourselbs from dat whale. Don’t be tearin’ de blubber out your
      neighbour’s mout, I say. Is not one shark dood right as toder to dat
      whale? And, by Gor, none on you has de right to dat whale; dat whale
      belong to some one else. I know some o’ you has berry brig mout,
      brigger dan oders; but den de brig mouts sometimes has de small
      bellies; so dat de brigness of de mout is not to swaller wid, but to
      bit off de blubber for de small fry ob sharks, dat can’t get into de
      scrouge to help demselves.”
      
      “Well done, old Fleece!” cried Stubb, “that’s Christianity; go on.”
      
      “No use goin’ on; de dam willains will keep a scougin’ and slappin’
      each oder, Massa Stubb; dey don’t hear one word; no use a-preachin’ to
      such dam g’uttons as you call ’em, till dare bellies is full, and dare
      bellies is bottomless; and when dey do get ’em full, dey wont hear you
      den; for den dey sink in de sea, go fast to sleep on de coral, and
      can’t hear not’ing at all, no more, for eber and eber.”
      
      “Upon my soul, I am about of the same opinion; so give the benediction,
      Fleece, and I’ll away to my supper.”
      
      Upon this, Fleece, holding both hands over the fishy mob, raised his
      shrill voice, and cried—
      
      “Cussed fellow-critters! Kick up de damndest row as ever you can; fill
      your dam’ bellies ’till dey bust—and den die.”
      
      “Now, cook,” said Stubb, resuming his supper at the capstan; “stand
      just where you stood before, there, over against me, and pay particular
      attention.”
      
      “All dention,” said Fleece, again stooping over upon his tongs in the
      desired position.
      
      “Well,” said Stubb, helping himself freely meanwhile; “I shall now go
      back to the subject of this steak. In the first place, how old are you,
      cook?”
      
      “What dat do wid de ’teak,” said the old black, testily.
      
      “Silence! How old are you, cook?”
      
      “’Bout ninety, dey say,” he gloomily muttered.
      
      “And you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years, cook,
      and don’t know yet how to cook a whale-steak?” rapidly bolting another
      mouthful at the last word, so that morsel seemed a continuation of the
      question. “Where were you born, cook?”
      
      “’Hind de hatchway, in ferry-boat, goin’ ober de Roanoke.”
      
      “Born in a ferry-boat! That’s queer, too. But I want to know what
      country you were born in, cook!”
      
      “Didn’t I say de Roanoke country?” he cried sharply.
      
      “No, you didn’t, cook; but I’ll tell you what I’m coming to, cook. You
      must go home and be born over again; you don’t know how to cook a
      whale-steak yet.”
      
      “Bress my soul, if I cook noder one,” he growled, angrily, turning
      round to depart.
      
      “Come back, cook;—here, hand me those tongs;—now take that bit of steak
      there, and tell me if you think that steak cooked as it should be? Take
      it, I say”—holding the tongs towards him—“take it, and taste it.”
      
      Faintly smacking his withered lips over it for a moment, the old negro
      muttered, “Best cooked ’teak I eber taste; joosy, berry joosy.”
      
      “Cook,” said Stubb, squaring himself once more; “do you belong to the
      church?”
      
      “Passed one once in Cape-Down,” said the old man sullenly.
      
      “And you have once in your life passed a holy church in Cape-Town,
      where you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as
      his beloved fellow-creatures, have you, cook! And yet you come here,
      and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now, eh?” said Stubb.
      “Where do you expect to go to, cook?”
      
      “Go to bed berry soon,” he mumbled, half-turning as he spoke.
      
      “Avast! heave to! I mean when you die, cook. It’s an awful question.
      Now what’s your answer?”
      
      “When dis old brack man dies,” said the negro slowly, changing his
      whole air and demeanor, “he hisself won’t go nowhere; but some bressed
      angel will come and fetch him.”
      
      “Fetch him? How? In a coach and four, as they fetched Elijah? And fetch
      him where?”
      
      “Up dere,” said Fleece, holding his tongs straight over his head, and
      keeping it there very solemnly.
      
      “So, then, you expect to go up into our main-top, do you, cook, when
      you are dead? But don’t you know the higher you climb, the colder it
      gets? Main-top, eh?”
      
      “Didn’t say dat t’all,” said Fleece, again in the sulks.
      
      “You said up there, didn’t you? and now look yourself, and see where
      your tongs are pointing. But, perhaps you expect to get into heaven by
      crawling through the lubber’s hole, cook; but, no, no, cook, you don’t
      get there, except you go the regular way, round by the rigging. It’s a
      ticklish business, but must be done, or else it’s no go. But none of us
      are in heaven yet. Drop your tongs, cook, and hear my orders. Do ye
      hear? Hold your hat in one hand, and clap t’other a’top of your heart,
      when I’m giving my orders, cook. What! that your heart, there?—that’s
      your gizzard! Aloft! aloft!—that’s it—now you have it. Hold it there
      now, and pay attention.”
      
      “All ’dention,” said the old black, with both hands placed as desired,
      vainly wriggling his grizzled head, as if to get both ears in front at
      one and the same time.
      
      “Well then, cook, you see this whale-steak of yours was so very bad,
      that I have put it out of sight as soon as possible; you see that,
      don’t you? Well, for the future, when you cook another whale-steak for
      my private table here, the capstan, I’ll tell you what to do so as not
      to spoil it by overdoing. Hold the steak in one hand, and show a live
      coal to it with the other; that done, dish it; d’ye hear? And now
      to-morrow, cook, when we are cutting in the fish, be sure you stand by
      to get the tips of his fins; have them put in pickle. As for the ends
      of the flukes, have them soused, cook. There, now ye may go.”
      
      But Fleece had hardly got three paces off, when he was recalled.
      
      “Cook, give me cutlets for supper to-morrow night in the mid-watch.
      D’ye hear? away you sail, then.—Halloa! stop! make a bow before you
      go.—Avast heaving again! Whale-balls for breakfast—don’t forget.”
      
      “Wish, by gor! whale eat him, ’stead of him eat whale. I’m bressed if
      he ain’t more of shark dan Massa Shark hisself,” muttered the old man,
      limping away; with which sage ejaculation he went to his hammock.
      
      
      CHAPTER 65. The Whale as a Dish.
      
      That mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp, and,
      like Stubb, eat him by his own light, as you may say; this seems so
      outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and
      philosophy of it.
      
      It is upon record, that three centuries ago the tongue of the Right
      Whale was esteemed a great delicacy in France, and commanded large
      prices there. Also, that in Henry VIIIth’s time, a certain cook of the
      court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be
      eaten with barbacued porpoises, which, you remember, are a species of
      whale. Porpoises, indeed, are to this day considered fine eating. The
      meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls, and being
      well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtle-balls or veal balls.
      The old monks of Dunfermline were very fond of them. They had a great
      porpoise grant from the crown.
      
      The fact is, that among his hunters at least, the whale would by all
      hands be considered a noble dish, were there not so much of him; but
      when you come to sit down before a meat-pie nearly one hundred feet
      long, it takes away your appetite. Only the most unprejudiced of men
      like Stubb, nowadays partake of cooked whales; but the Esquimaux are
      not so fastidious. We all know how they live upon whales, and have rare
      old vintages of prime old train oil. Zogranda, one of their most famous
      doctors, recommends strips of blubber for infants, as being exceedingly
      juicy and nourishing. And this reminds me that certain Englishmen, who
      long ago were accidentally left in Greenland by a whaling vessel—that
      these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of
      whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber. Among
      the Dutch whalemen these scraps are called “fritters”; which, indeed,
      they greatly resemble, being brown and crisp, and smelling something
      like old Amsterdam housewives’ dough-nuts or oly-cooks, when fresh.
      They have such an eatable look that the most self-denying stranger can
      hardly keep his hands off.
      
      But what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish, is his
      exceeding richness. He is the great prize ox of the sea, too fat to be
      delicately good. Look at his hump, which would be as fine eating as the
      buffalo’s (which is esteemed a rare dish), were it not such a solid
      pyramid of fat. But the spermaceti itself, how bland and creamy that
      is; like the transparent, half-jellied, white meat of a cocoanut in the
      third month of its growth, yet far too rich to supply a substitute for
      butter. Nevertheless, many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into
      some other substance, and then partaking of it. In the long try watches
      of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their
      ship-biscuit into the huge oil-pots and let them fry there awhile. Many
      a good supper have I thus made.
      
      In the case of a small Sperm Whale the brains are accounted a fine
      dish. The casket of the skull is broken into with an axe, and the two
      plump, whitish lobes being withdrawn (precisely resembling two large
      puddings), they are then mixed with flour, and cooked into a most
      delectable mess, in flavor somewhat resembling calves’ head, which is
      quite a dish among some epicures; and every one knows that some young
      bucks among the epicures, by continually dining upon calves’ brains, by
      and by get to have a little brains of their own, so as to be able to
      tell a calf’s head from their own heads; which, indeed, requires
      uncommon discrimination. And that is the reason why a young buck with
      an intelligent looking calf’s head before him, is somehow one of the
      saddest sights you can see. The head looks a sort of reproachfully at
      him, with an “Et tu Brute!” expression.
      
      It is not, perhaps, entirely because the whale is so excessively
      unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with
      abhorrence; that appears to result, in some way, from the consideration
      before mentioned: _i.e._ that a man should eat a newly murdered thing
      of the sea, and eat it too by its own light. But no doubt the first man
      that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer; perhaps he was
      hung; and if he had been put on his trial by oxen, he certainly would
      have been; and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does. Go to the
      meat-market of a Saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds
      staring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds. Does not that sight
      take a tooth out of the cannibal’s jaw? Cannibals? who is not a
      cannibal? I tell you it will be more tolerable for the Fejee that
      salted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a coming famine; it
      will be more tolerable for that provident Fejee, I say, in the day of
      judgment, than for thee, civilized and enlightened gourmand, who
      nailest geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy
      paté-de-foie-gras.
      
      But Stubb, he eats the whale by its own light, does he? and that is
      adding insult to injury, is it? Look at your knife-handle, there, my
      civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef, what is
      that handle made of?—what but the bones of the brother of the very ox
      you are eating? And what do you pick your teeth with, after devouring
      that fat goose? With a feather of the same fowl. And with what quill
      did the Secretary of the Society for the Suppression of Cruelty to
      Ganders formally indite his circulars? It is only within the last month
      or two that that society passed a resolution to patronize nothing but
      steel pens.
      
      
      CHAPTER 66. The Shark Massacre.
      
      When in the Southern Fishery, a captured Sperm Whale, after long and
      weary toil, is brought alongside late at night, it is not, as a general
      thing at least, customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting
      him in. For that business is an exceedingly laborious one; is not very
      soon completed; and requires all hands to set about it. Therefore, the
      common usage is to take in all sail; lash the helm a’lee; and then send
      every one below to his hammock till daylight, with the reservation
      that, until that time, anchor-watches shall be kept; that is, two and
      two for an hour, each couple, the crew in rotation shall mount the deck
      to see that all goes well.
      
      But sometimes, especially upon the Line in the Pacific, this plan will
      not answer at all; because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather
      round the moored carcase, that were he left so for six hours, say, on a
      stretch, little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning. In
      most other parts of the ocean, however, where these fish do not so
      largely abound, their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably
      diminished, by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whaling-spades, a
      procedure notwithstanding, which, in some instances, only seems to
      tickle them into still greater activity. But it was not thus in the
      present case with the Pequod’s sharks; though, to be sure, any man
      unaccustomed to such sights, to have looked over her side that night,
      would have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese, and
      those sharks the maggots in it.
      
      Nevertheless, upon Stubb setting the anchor-watch after his supper was
      concluded; and when, accordingly, Queequeg and a forecastle seaman came
      on deck, no small excitement was created among the sharks; for
      immediately suspending the cutting stages over the side, and lowering
      three lanterns, so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid
      sea, these two mariners, darting their long whaling-spades, kept up an
      incessant murdering of the sharks,* by striking the keen steel deep
      into their skulls, seemingly their only vital part. But in the foamy
      confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts, the marksmen could not
      always hit their mark; and this brought about new revelations of the
      incredible ferocity of the foe. They viciously snapped, not only at
      each other’s disembowelments, but like flexible bows, bent round, and
      bit their own; till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again
      by the same mouth, to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound. Nor was
      this all. It was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these
      creatures. A sort of generic or Pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in
      their very joints and bones, after what might be called the individual
      life had departed. Killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin,
      one of these sharks almost took poor Queequeg’s hand off, when he tried
      to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw.
      
      *The whaling-spade used for cutting-in is made of the very best steel;
      is about the bigness of a man’s spread hand; and in general shape,
      corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named; only its
      sides are perfectly flat, and its upper end considerably narrower than
      the lower. This weapon is always kept as sharp as possible; and when
      being used is occasionally honed, just like a razor. In its socket, a
      stiff pole, from twenty to thirty feet long, is inserted for a handle.
      
      “Queequeg no care what god made him shark,” said the savage,
      agonizingly lifting his hand up and down; “wedder Fejee god or
      Nantucket god; but de god wat made shark must be one dam Ingin.”
      
      
      CHAPTER 67. Cutting In.
      
      It was a Saturday night, and such a Sabbath as followed! Ex officio
      professors of Sabbath breaking are all whalemen. The ivory Pequod was
      turned into what seemed a shamble; every sailor a butcher. You would
      have thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods.
      
      In the first place, the enormous cutting tackles, among other ponderous
      things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green, and
      which no single man can possibly lift—this vast bunch of grapes was
      swayed up to the main-top and firmly lashed to the lower mast-head, the
      strongest point anywhere above a ship’s deck. The end of the
      hawser-like rope winding through these intricacies, was then conducted
      to the windlass, and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over
      the whale; to this block the great blubber hook, weighing some one
      hundred pounds, was attached. And now suspended in stages over the
      side, Starbuck and Stubb, the mates, armed with their long spades,
      began cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just
      above the nearest of the two side-fins. This done, a broad,
      semicircular line is cut round the hole, the hook is inserted, and the
      main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus, now commence heaving
      in one dense crowd at the windlass. When instantly, the entire ship
      careens over on her side; every bolt in her starts like the nail-heads
      of an old house in frosty weather; she trembles, quivers, and nods her
      frighted mast-heads to the sky. More and more she leans over to the
      whale, while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a
      helping heave from the billows; till at last, a swift, startling snap
      is heard; with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from
      the whale, and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it
      the disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber. Now as
      the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange,
      so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes
      stripped by spiralizing it. For the strain constantly kept up by the
      windlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the
      water, and as the blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the
      line called the “scarf,” simultaneously cut by the spades of Starbuck
      and Stubb, the mates; and just as fast as it is thus peeled off, and
      indeed by that very act itself, it is all the time being hoisted higher
      and higher aloft till its upper end grazes the main-top; the men at the
      windlass then cease heaving, and for a moment or two the prodigious
      blood-dripping mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky, and
      every one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings, else
      it may box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard.
      
      One of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long, keen weapon
      called a boarding-sword, and watching his chance he dexterously slices
      out a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass. Into
      this hole, the end of the second alternating great tackle is then
      hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber, in order to prepare for
      what follows. Whereupon, this accomplished swordsman, warning all hands
      to stand off, once more makes a scientific dash at the mass, and with a
      few sidelong, desperate, lunging slicings, severs it completely in
      twain; so that while the short lower part is still fast, the long upper
      strip, called a blanket-piece, swings clear, and is all ready for
      lowering. The heavers forward now resume their song, and while the one
      tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale, the other
      is slowly slackened away, and down goes the first strip through the
      main hatchway right beneath, into an unfurnished parlor called the
      blubber-room. Into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep
      coiling away the long blanket-piece as if it were a great live mass of
      plaited serpents. And thus the work proceeds; the two tackles hoisting
      and lowering simultaneously; both whale and windlass heaving, the
      heavers singing, the blubber-room gentlemen coiling, the mates
      scarfing, the ship straining, and all hands swearing occasionally, by
      way of assuaging the general friction.
      
      
      CHAPTER 68. The Blanket.
      
      I have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject, the skin
      of the whale. I have had controversies about it with experienced
      whalemen afloat, and learned naturalists ashore. My original opinion
      remains unchanged; but it is only an opinion.
      
      The question is, what and where is the skin of the whale? Already you
      know what his blubber is. That blubber is something of the consistence
      of firm, close-grained beef, but tougher, more elastic and compact, and
      ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness.
      
      Now, however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any
      creature’s skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness, yet
      in point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption;
      because you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the
      whale’s body but that same blubber; and the outermost enveloping layer
      of any animal, if reasonably dense, what can that be but the skin?
      True, from the unmarred dead body of the whale, you may scrape off with
      your hand an infinitely thin, transparent substance, somewhat
      resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass, only it is almost as
      flexible and soft as satin; that is, previous to being dried, when it
      not only contracts and thickens, but becomes rather hard and brittle. I
      have several such dried bits, which I use for marks in my whale-books.
      It is transparent, as I said before; and being laid upon the printed
      page, I have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a
      magnifying influence. At any rate, it is pleasant to read about whales
      through their own spectacles, as you may say. But what I am driving at
      here is this. That same infinitely thin, isinglass substance, which, I
      admit, invests the entire body of the whale, is not so much to be
      regarded as the skin of the creature, as the skin of the skin, so to
      speak; for it were simply ridiculous to say, that the proper skin of
      the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a
      new-born child. But no more of this.
      
      Assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale; then, when this skin,
      as in the case of a very large Sperm Whale, will yield the bulk of one
      hundred barrels of oil; and, when it is considered that, in quantity,
      or rather weight, that oil, in its expressed state, is only three
      fourths, and not the entire substance of the coat; some idea may hence
      be had of the enormousness of that animated mass, a mere part of whose
      mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that. Reckoning ten
      barrels to the ton, you have ten tons for the net weight of only three
      quarters of the stuff of the whale’s skin.
      
      In life, the visible surface of the Sperm Whale is not the least among
      the many marvels he presents. Almost invariably it is all over
      obliquely crossed and re-crossed with numberless straight marks in
      thick array, something like those in the finest Italian line
      engravings. But these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the
      isinglass substance above mentioned, but seem to be seen through it, as
      if they were engraved upon the body itself. Nor is this all. In some
      instances, to the quick, observant eye, those linear marks, as in a
      veritable engraving, but afford the ground for far other delineations.
      These are hieroglyphical; that is, if you call those mysterious cyphers
      on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics, then that is the proper word to
      use in the present connexion. By my retentive memory of the
      hieroglyphics upon one Sperm Whale in particular, I was much struck
      with a plate representing the old Indian characters chiselled on the
      famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the Upper Mississippi.
      Like those mystic rocks, too, the mystic-marked whale remains
      undecipherable. This allusion to the Indian rocks reminds me of another
      thing. Besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the Sperm
      Whale presents, he not seldom displays the back, and more especially
      his flanks, effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance, by
      reason of numerous rude scratches, altogether of an irregular, random
      aspect. I should say that those New England rocks on the sea-coast,
      which Agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact
      with vast floating icebergs—I should say, that those rocks must not a
      little resemble the Sperm Whale in this particular. It also seems to me
      that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact
      with other whales; for I have most remarked them in the large,
      full-grown bulls of the species.
      
      A word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the
      whale. It has already been said, that it is stript from him in long
      pieces, called blanket-pieces. Like most sea-terms, this one is very
      happy and significant. For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber
      as in a real blanket or counterpane; or, still better, an Indian poncho
      slipt over his head, and skirting his extremity. It is by reason of
      this cosy blanketing of his body, that the whale is enabled to keep
      himself comfortable in all weathers, in all seas, times, and tides.
      What would become of a Greenland whale, say, in those shuddering, icy
      seas of the North, if unsupplied with his cosy surtout? True, other
      fish are found exceedingly brisk in those Hyperborean waters; but
      these, be it observed, are your cold-blooded, lungless fish, whose very
      bellies are refrigerators; creatures, that warm themselves under the
      lee of an iceberg, as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn
      fire; whereas, like man, the whale has lungs and warm blood. Freeze his
      blood, and he dies. How wonderful is it then—except after
      explanation—that this great monster, to whom corporeal warmth is as
      indispensable as it is to man; how wonderful that he should be found at
      home, immersed to his lips for life in those Arctic waters! where, when
      seamen fall overboard, they are sometimes found, months afterwards,
      perpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice, as a fly is
      found glued in amber. But more surprising is it to know, as has been
      proved by experiment, that the blood of a Polar whale is warmer than
      that of a Borneo negro in summer.
      
      It does seem to me, that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong
      individual vitality, and the rare virtue of thick walls, and the rare
      virtue of interior spaciousness. Oh, man! admire and model thyself
      after the whale! Do thou, too, remain warm among ice. Do thou, too,
      live in this world without being of it. Be cool at the equator; keep
      thy blood fluid at the Pole. Like the great dome of St. Peter’s, and
      like the great whale, retain, O man! in all seasons a temperature of
      thine own.
      
      But how easy and how hopeless to teach these fine things! Of erections,
      how few are domed like St. Peter’s! of creatures, how few vast as the
      whale!
      
      
      CHAPTER 69. The Funeral.
      
      “Haul in the chains! Let the carcase go astern!”
      
      The vast tackles have now done their duty. The peeled white body of the
      beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre; though changed in hue,
      it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk. It is still colossal.
      Slowly it floats more and more away, the water round it torn and
      splashed by the insatiate sharks, and the air above vexed with
      rapacious flights of screaming fowls, whose beaks are like so many
      insulting poniards in the whale. The vast white headless phantom floats
      further and further from the ship, and every rod that it so floats,
      what seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of fowls, augment the
      murderous din. For hours and hours from the almost stationary ship that
      hideous sight is seen. Beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky, upon
      the fair face of the pleasant sea, wafted by the joyous breezes, that
      great mass of death floats on and on, till lost in infinite
      perspectives.
      
      There’s a most doleful and most mocking funeral! The sea-vultures all
      in pious mourning, the air-sharks all punctiliously in black or
      speckled. In life but few of them would have helped the whale, I ween,
      if peradventure he had needed it; but upon the banquet of his funeral
      they most piously do pounce. Oh, horrible vultureism of earth! from
      which not the mightiest whale is free.
      
      Nor is this the end. Desecrated as the body is, a vengeful ghost
      survives and hovers over it to scare. Espied by some timid man-of-war
      or blundering discovery-vessel from afar, when the distance obscuring
      the swarming fowls, nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in
      the sun, and the white spray heaving high against it; straightway the
      whale’s unharming corpse, with trembling fingers is set down in the
      log—_shoals, rocks, and breakers hereabouts: beware!_ And for years
      afterwards, perhaps, ships shun the place; leaping over it as silly
      sheep leap over a vacuum, because their leader originally leaped there
      when a stick was held. There’s your law of precedents; there’s your
      utility of traditions; there’s the story of your obstinate survival of
      old beliefs never bottomed on the earth, and now not even hovering in
      the air! There’s orthodoxy!
      
      Thus, while in life the great whale’s body may have been a real terror
      to his foes, in his death his ghost becomes a powerless panic to a
      world.
      
      Are you a believer in ghosts, my friend? There are other ghosts than
      the Cock-Lane one, and far deeper men than Doctor Johnson who believe
      in them.
      
      
      CHAPTER 70. The Sphynx.
      
      It should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping
      the body of the leviathan, he was beheaded. Now, the beheading of the
      Sperm Whale is a scientific anatomical feat, upon which experienced
      whale surgeons very much pride themselves: and not without reason.
      
      Consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck;
      on the contrary, where his head and body seem to join, there, in that
      very place, is the thickest part of him. Remember, also, that the
      surgeon must operate from above, some eight or ten feet intervening
      between him and his subject, and that subject almost hidden in a
      discoloured, rolling, and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea. Bear
      in mind, too, that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut
      many feet deep in the flesh; and in that subterraneous manner, without
      so much as getting one single peep into the ever-contracting gash thus
      made, he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent, interdicted parts,
      and exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion
      into the skull. Do you not marvel, then, at Stubb’s boast, that he
      demanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whale?
      
      When first severed, the head is dropped astern and held there by a
      cable till the body is stripped. That done, if it belong to a small
      whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of. But, with a
      full grown leviathan this is impossible; for the sperm whale’s head
      embraces nearly one third of his entire bulk, and completely to suspend
      such a burden as that, even by the immense tackles of a whaler, this
      were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a Dutch barn in jewellers’
      scales.
      
      The Pequod’s whale being decapitated and the body stripped, the head
      was hoisted against the ship’s side—about half way out of the sea, so
      that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element. And
      there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it, by reason of
      the enormous downward drag from the lower mast-head, and every yard-arm
      on that side projecting like a crane over the waves; there, that
      blood-dripping head hung to the Pequod’s waist like the giant
      Holofernes’s from the girdle of Judith.
      
      When this last task was accomplished it was noon, and the seamen went
      below to their dinner. Silence reigned over the before tumultuous but
      now deserted deck. An intense copper calm, like a universal yellow
      lotus, was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves
      upon the sea.
      
      A short space elapsed, and up into this noiselessness came Ahab alone
      from his cabin. Taking a few turns on the quarter-deck, he paused to
      gaze over the side, then slowly getting into the main-chains he took
      Stubb’s long spade—still remaining there after the whale’s
      decapitation—and striking it into the lower part of the half-suspended
      mass, placed its other end crutch-wise under one arm, and so stood
      leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head.
      
      It was a black and hooded head; and hanging there in the midst of so
      intense a calm, it seemed the Sphynx’s in the desert. “Speak, thou vast
      and venerable head,” muttered Ahab, “which, though ungarnished with a
      beard, yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses; speak, mighty
      head, and tell us the secret thing that is in thee. Of all divers, thou
      hast dived the deepest. That head upon which the upper sun now gleams,
      has moved amid this world’s foundations. Where unrecorded names and
      navies rust, and untold hopes and anchors rot; where in her murderous
      hold this frigate earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the
      drowned; there, in that awful water-land, there was thy most familiar
      home. Thou hast been where bell or diver never went; hast slept by many
      a sailor’s side, where sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay
      them down. Thou saw’st the locked lovers when leaping from their
      flaming ship; heart to heart they sank beneath the exulting wave; true
      to each other, when heaven seemed false to them. Thou saw’st the
      murdered mate when tossed by pirates from the midnight deck; for hours
      he fell into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw; and his
      murderers still sailed on unharmed—while swift lightnings shivered the
      neighboring ship that would have borne a righteous husband to
      outstretched, longing arms. O head! thou hast seen enough to split the
      planets and make an infidel of Abraham, and not one syllable is thine!”
      
      “Sail ho!” cried a triumphant voice from the main-mast-head.
      
      “Aye? Well, now, that’s cheering,” cried Ahab, suddenly erecting
      himself, while whole thunder-clouds swept aside from his brow. “That
      lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better
      man.—Where away?”
      
      “Three points on the starboard bow, sir, and bringing down her breeze
      to us!
      
      “Better and better, man. Would now St. Paul would come along that way,
      and to my breezelessness bring his breeze! O Nature, and O soul of man!
      how far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies! not the
      smallest atom stirs or lives on matter, but has its cunning duplicate
      in mind.”
      
      
      CHAPTER 71. The Jeroboam’s Story.
      
      Hand in hand, ship and breeze blew on; but the breeze came faster than
      the ship, and soon the Pequod began to rock.
      
      By and by, through the glass the stranger’s boats and manned mast-heads
      proved her a whale-ship. But as she was so far to windward, and
      shooting by, apparently making a passage to some other ground, the
      Pequod could not hope to reach her. So the signal was set to see what
      response would be made.
      
      Here be it said, that like the vessels of military marines, the ships
      of the American Whale Fleet have each a private signal; all which
      signals being collected in a book with the names of the respective
      vessels attached, every captain is provided with it. Thereby, the whale
      commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean, even at
      considerable distances and with no small facility.
      
      The Pequod’s signal was at last responded to by the stranger’s setting
      her own; which proved the ship to be the Jeroboam of Nantucket.
      Squaring her yards, she bore down, ranged abeam under the Pequod’s lee,
      and lowered a boat; it soon drew nigh; but, as the side-ladder was
      being rigged by Starbuck’s order to accommodate the visiting captain,
      the stranger in question waved his hand from his boat’s stern in token
      of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary. It turned out that the
      Jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board, and that Mayhew, her
      captain, was fearful of infecting the Pequod’s company. For, though
      himself and boat’s crew remained untainted, and though his ship was
      half a rifle-shot off, and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and
      flowing between; yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine
      of the land, he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with
      the Pequod.
      
      But this did by no means prevent all communications. Preserving an
      interval of some few yards between itself and the ship, the Jeroboam’s
      boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to
      the Pequod, as she heavily forged through the sea (for by this time it
      blew very fresh), with her main-topsail aback; though, indeed, at times
      by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave, the boat would be pushed
      some way ahead; but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper
      bearings again. Subject to this, and other the like interruptions now
      and then, a conversation was sustained between the two parties; but at
      intervals not without still another interruption of a very different
      sort.
      
      Pulling an oar in the Jeroboam’s boat, was a man of a singular
      appearance, even in that wild whaling life where individual
      notabilities make up all totalities. He was a small, short, youngish
      man, sprinkled all over his face with freckles, and wearing redundant
      yellow hair. A long-skirted, cabalistically-cut coat of a faded walnut
      tinge enveloped him; the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on
      his wrists. A deep, settled, fanatic delirium was in his eyes.
      
      So soon as this figure had been first descried, Stubb had
      exclaimed—“That’s he! that’s he!—the long-togged scaramouch the
      Town-Ho’s company told us of!” Stubb here alluded to a strange story
      told of the Jeroboam, and a certain man among her crew, some time
      previous when the Pequod spoke the Town-Ho. According to this account
      and what was subsequently learned, it seemed that the scaramouch in
      question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the
      Jeroboam. His story was this:
      
      He had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of Neskyeuna
      Shakers, where he had been a great prophet; in their cracked, secret
      meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a
      trap-door, announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial, which he
      carried in his vest-pocket; but, which, instead of containing
      gunpowder, was supposed to be charged with laudanum. A strange,
      apostolic whim having seized him, he had left Neskyeuna for Nantucket,
      where, with that cunning peculiar to craziness, he assumed a steady,
      common-sense exterior, and offered himself as a green-hand candidate
      for the Jeroboam’s whaling voyage. They engaged him; but straightway
      upon the ship’s getting out of sight of land, his insanity broke out in
      a freshet. He announced himself as the archangel Gabriel, and commanded
      the captain to jump overboard. He published his manifesto, whereby he
      set himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and
      vicar-general of all Oceanica. The unflinching earnestness with which
      he declared these things;—the dark, daring play of his sleepless,
      excited imagination, and all the preternatural terrors of real
      delirium, united to invest this Gabriel in the minds of the majority of
      the ignorant crew, with an atmosphere of sacredness. Moreover, they
      were afraid of him. As such a man, however, was not of much practical
      use in the ship, especially as he refused to work except when he
      pleased, the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him; but
      apprised that that individual’s intention was to land him in the first
      convenient port, the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and
      vials—devoting the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition, in
      case this intention was carried out. So strongly did he work upon his
      disciples among the crew, that at last in a body they went to the
      captain and told him if Gabriel was sent from the ship, not a man of
      them would remain. He was therefore forced to relinquish his plan. Nor
      would they permit Gabriel to be any way maltreated, say or do what he
      would; so that it came to pass that Gabriel had the complete freedom of
      the ship. The consequence of all this was, that the archangel cared
      little or nothing for the captain and mates; and since the epidemic had
      broken out, he carried a higher hand than ever; declaring that the
      plague, as he called it, was at his sole command; nor should it be
      stayed but according to his good pleasure. The sailors, mostly poor
      devils, cringed, and some of them fawned before him; in obedience to
      his instructions, sometimes rendering him personal homage, as to a god.
      Such things may seem incredible; but, however wondrous, they are true.
      Nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to the
      measureless self-deception of the fanatic himself, as his measureless
      power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others. But it is time to
      return to the Pequod.
      
      “I fear not thy epidemic, man,” said Ahab from the bulwarks, to Captain
      Mayhew, who stood in the boat’s stern; “come on board.”
      
      But now Gabriel started to his feet.
      
      “Think, think of the fevers, yellow and bilious! Beware of the horrible
      plague!”
      
      “Gabriel! Gabriel!” cried Captain Mayhew; “thou must either—” But that
      instant a headlong wave shot the boat far ahead, and its seethings
      drowned all speech.
      
      “Hast thou seen the White Whale?” demanded Ahab, when the boat drifted
      back.
      
      “Think, think of thy whale-boat, stoven and sunk! Beware of the
      horrible tail!”
      
      “I tell thee again, Gabriel, that—” But again the boat tore ahead as if
      dragged by fiends. Nothing was said for some moments, while a
      succession of riotous waves rolled by, which by one of those occasional
      caprices of the seas were tumbling, not heaving it. Meantime, the
      hoisted sperm whale’s head jogged about very violently, and Gabriel was
      seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel
      nature seemed to warrant.
      
      When this interlude was over, Captain Mayhew began a dark story
      concerning Moby Dick; not, however, without frequent interruptions from
      Gabriel, whenever his name was mentioned, and the crazy sea that seemed
      leagued with him.
      
      It seemed that the Jeroboam had not long left home, when upon speaking
      a whale-ship, her people were reliably apprised of the existence of
      Moby Dick, and the havoc he had made. Greedily sucking in this
      intelligence, Gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the
      White Whale, in case the monster should be seen; in his gibbering
      insanity, pronouncing the White Whale to be no less a being than the
      Shaker God incarnated; the Shakers receiving the Bible. But when, some
      year or two afterwards, Moby Dick was fairly sighted from the
      mast-heads, Macey, the chief mate, burned with ardour to encounter him;
      and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the
      opportunity, despite all the archangel’s denunciations and
      forewarnings, Macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat.
      With them he pushed off; and, after much weary pulling, and many
      perilous, unsuccessful onsets, he at last succeeded in getting one iron
      fast. Meantime, Gabriel, ascending to the main-royal mast-head, was
      tossing one arm in frantic gestures, and hurling forth prophecies of
      speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity. Now, while
      Macey, the mate, was standing up in his boat’s bow, and with all the
      reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the
      whale, and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance, lo! a
      broad white shadow rose from the sea; by its quick, fanning motion,
      temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen. Next
      instant, the luckless mate, so full of furious life, was smitten bodily
      into the air, and making a long arc in his descent, fell into the sea
      at the distance of about fifty yards. Not a chip of the boat was
      harmed, nor a hair of any oarsman’s head; but the mate for ever sank.
      
      It is well to parenthesize here, that of the fatal accidents in the
      Sperm-Whale Fishery, this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any.
      Sometimes, nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated;
      oftener the boat’s bow is knocked off, or the thigh-board, in which the
      headsman stands, is torn from its place and accompanies the body. But
      strangest of all is the circumstance, that in more instances than one,
      when the body has been recovered, not a single mark of violence is
      discernible; the man being stark dead.
      
      The whole calamity, with the falling form of Macey, was plainly
      descried from the ship. Raising a piercing shriek—“The vial! the vial!”
      Gabriel called off the terror-stricken crew from the further hunting of
      the whale. This terrible event clothed the archangel with added
      influence; because his credulous disciples believed that he had
      specifically fore-announced it, instead of only making a general
      prophecy, which any one might have done, and so have chanced to hit one
      of many marks in the wide margin allowed. He became a nameless terror
      to the ship.
      
      Mayhew having concluded his narration, Ahab put such questions to him,
      that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he
      intended to hunt the White Whale, if opportunity should offer. To which
      Ahab answered—“Aye.” Straightway, then, Gabriel once more started to
      his feet, glaring upon the old man, and vehemently exclaimed, with
      downward pointed finger—“Think, think of the blasphemer—dead, and down
      there!—beware of the blasphemer’s end!”
      
      Ahab stolidly turned aside; then said to Mayhew, “Captain, I have just
      bethought me of my letter-bag; there is a letter for one of thy
      officers, if I mistake not. Starbuck, look over the bag.”
      
      Every whale-ship takes out a goodly number of letters for various
      ships, whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed,
      depends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans.
      Thus, most letters never reach their mark; and many are only received
      after attaining an age of two or three years or more.
      
      Soon Starbuck returned with a letter in his hand. It was sorely
      tumbled, damp, and covered with a dull, spotted, green mould, in
      consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin. Of such a
      letter, Death himself might well have been the post-boy.
      
      “Can’st not read it?” cried Ahab. “Give it me, man. Aye, aye, it’s but
      a dim scrawl;—what’s this?” As he was studying it out, Starbuck took a
      long cutting-spade pole, and with his knife slightly split the end, to
      insert the letter there, and in that way, hand it to the boat, without
      its coming any closer to the ship.
      
      Meantime, Ahab holding the letter, muttered, “Mr. Har—yes, Mr. Harry—(a
      woman’s pinny hand,—the man’s wife, I’ll wager)—Aye—Mr. Harry Macey,
      Ship Jeroboam;—why it’s Macey, and he’s dead!”
      
      “Poor fellow! poor fellow! and from his wife,” sighed Mayhew; “but let
      me have it.”
      
      “Nay, keep it thyself,” cried Gabriel to Ahab; “thou art soon going
      that way.”
      
      “Curses throttle thee!” yelled Ahab. “Captain Mayhew, stand by now to
      receive it”; and taking the fatal missive from Starbuck’s hands, he
      caught it in the slit of the pole, and reached it over towards the
      boat. But as he did so, the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing;
      the boat drifted a little towards the ship’s stern; so that, as if by
      magic, the letter suddenly ranged along with Gabriel’s eager hand. He
      clutched it in an instant, seized the boat-knife, and impaling the
      letter on it, sent it thus loaded back into the ship. It fell at Ahab’s
      feet. Then Gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their
      oars, and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the
      Pequod.
      
      As, after this interlude, the seamen resumed their work upon the jacket
      of the whale, many strange things were hinted in reference to this wild
      affair.
      
      
      CHAPTER 72. The Monkey-Rope.
      
      In the tumultuous business of cutting-in and attending to a whale,
      there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew. Now hands
      are wanted here, and then again hands are wanted there. There is no
      staying in any one place; for at one and the same time everything has
      to be done everywhere. It is much the same with him who endeavors the
      description of the scene. We must now retrace our way a little. It was
      mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whale’s back, the
      blubber-hook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the
      spades of the mates. But how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that
      same hook get fixed in that hole? It was inserted there by my
      particular friend Queequeg, whose duty it was, as harpooneer, to
      descend upon the monster’s back for the special purpose referred to.
      But in very many cases, circumstances require that the harpooneer shall
      remain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is
      concluded. The whale, be it observed, lies almost entirely submerged,
      excepting the immediate parts operated upon. So down there, some ten
      feet below the level of the deck, the poor harpooneer flounders about,
      half on the whale and half in the water, as the vast mass revolves like
      a tread-mill beneath him. On the occasion in question, Queequeg figured
      in the Highland costume—a shirt and socks—in which to my eyes, at
      least, he appeared to uncommon advantage; and no one had a better
      chance to observe him, as will presently be seen.
      
      Being the savage’s bowsman, that is, the person who pulled the bow-oar
      in his boat (the second one from forward), it was my cheerful duty to
      attend upon him while taking that hard-scrabble scramble upon the dead
      whale’s back. You have seen Italian organ-boys holding a dancing-ape by
      a long cord. Just so, from the ship’s steep side, did I hold Queequeg
      down there in the sea, by what is technically called in the fishery a
      monkey-rope, attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his
      waist.
      
      It was a humorously perilous business for both of us. For, before we
      proceed further, it must be said that the monkey-rope was fast at both
      ends; fast to Queequeg’s broad canvas belt, and fast to my narrow
      leather one. So that for better or for worse, we two, for the time,
      were wedded; and should poor Queequeg sink to rise no more, then both
      usage and honor demanded, that instead of cutting the cord, it should
      drag me down in his wake. So, then, an elongated Siamese ligature
      united us. Queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother; nor could I
      any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond
      entailed.
      
      So strongly and metaphysically did I conceive of my situation then,
      that while earnestly watching his motions, I seemed distinctly to
      perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock
      company of two; that my free will had received a mortal wound; and that
      another’s mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited
      disaster and death. Therefore, I saw that here was a sort of
      interregnum in Providence; for its even-handed equity never could have
      so gross an injustice. And yet still further pondering—while I jerked
      him now and then from between the whale and ship, which would threaten
      to jam him—still further pondering, I say, I saw that this situation of
      mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes; only, in
      most cases, he, one way or other, has this Siamese connexion with a
      plurality of other mortals. If your banker breaks, you snap; if your
      apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills, you die. True,
      you may say that, by exceeding caution, you may possibly escape these
      and the multitudinous other evil chances of life. But handle Queequeg’s
      monkey-rope heedfully as I would, sometimes he jerked it so, that I
      came very near sliding overboard. Nor could I possibly forget that, do
      what I would, I only had the management of one end of it.*
      
      *The monkey-rope is found in all whalers; but it was only in the Pequod
      that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together. This
      improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man
      than Stubb, in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest
      possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his
      monkey-rope holder.
      
      I have hinted that I would often jerk poor Queequeg from between the
      whale and the ship—where he would occasionally fall, from the incessant
      rolling and swaying of both. But this was not the only jamming jeopardy
      he was exposed to. Unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the
      night, the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before
      pent blood which began to flow from the carcass—the rabid creatures
      swarmed round it like bees in a beehive.
      
      And right in among those sharks was Queequeg; who often pushed them
      aside with his floundering feet. A thing altogether incredible were it
      not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale, the otherwise
      miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man.
      
      Nevertheless, it may well be believed that since they have such a
      ravenous finger in the pie, it is deemed but wise to look sharp to
      them. Accordingly, besides the monkey-rope, with which I now and then
      jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what
      seemed a peculiarly ferocious shark—he was provided with still another
      protection. Suspended over the side in one of the stages, Tashtego and
      Daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen
      whale-spades, wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could
      reach. This procedure of theirs, to be sure, was very disinterested and
      benevolent of them. They meant Queequeg’s best happiness, I admit; but
      in their hasty zeal to befriend him, and from the circumstance that
      both he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the blood-muddled
      water, those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a
      leg than a tail. But poor Queequeg, I suppose, straining and gasping
      there with that great iron hook—poor Queequeg, I suppose, only prayed
      to his Yojo, and gave up his life into the hands of his gods.
      
      Well, well, my dear comrade and twin-brother, thought I, as I drew in
      and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the sea—what matters
      it, after all? Are you not the precious image of each and all of us men
      in this whaling world? That unsounded ocean you gasp in, is Life; those
      sharks, your foes; those spades, your friends; and what between sharks
      and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril, poor lad.
      
      But courage! there is good cheer in store for you, Queequeg. For now,
      as with blue lips and blood-shot eyes the exhausted savage at last
      climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily
      trembling over the side; the steward advances, and with a benevolent,
      consolatory glance hands him—what? Some hot Cognac? No! hands him, ye
      gods! hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water!
      
      “Ginger? Do I smell ginger?” suspiciously asked Stubb, coming near.
      “Yes, this must be ginger,” peering into the as yet untasted cup. Then
      standing as if incredulous for a while, he calmly walked towards the
      astonished steward slowly saying, “Ginger? ginger? and will you have
      the goodness to tell me, Mr. Dough-Boy, where lies the virtue of
      ginger? Ginger! is ginger the sort of fuel you use, Dough-boy, to
      kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal? Ginger!—what the devil is
      ginger? Sea-coal? firewood?—lucifer matches?—tinder?—gunpowder?—what
      the devil is ginger, I say, that you offer this cup to our poor
      Queequeg here.”
      
      “There is some sneaking Temperance Society movement about this
      business,” he suddenly added, now approaching Starbuck, who had just
      come from forward. “Will you look at that kannakin, sir: smell of it,
      if you please.” Then watching the mate’s countenance, he added, “The
      steward, Mr. Starbuck, had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to
      Queequeg, there, this instant off the whale. Is the steward an
      apothecary, sir? and may I ask whether this is the sort of bitters by
      which he blows back the life into a half-drowned man?”
      
      “I trust not,” said Starbuck, “it is poor stuff enough.”
      
      “Aye, aye, steward,” cried Stubb, “we’ll teach you to drug a
      harpooneer; none of your apothecary’s medicine here; you want to poison
      us, do ye? You have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder
      us all, and pocket the proceeds, do ye?”
      
      “It was not me,” cried Dough-Boy, “it was Aunt Charity that brought the
      ginger on board; and bade me never give the harpooneers any spirits,
      but only this ginger-jub—so she called it.”
      
      “Ginger-jub! you gingerly rascal! take that! and run along with ye to
      the lockers, and get something better. I hope I do no wrong, Mr.
      Starbuck. It is the captain’s orders—grog for the harpooneer on a
      whale.”
      
      “Enough,” replied Starbuck, “only don’t hit him again, but—”
      
      “Oh, I never hurt when I hit, except when I hit a whale or something of
      that sort; and this fellow’s a weazel. What were you about saying,
      sir?”
      
      “Only this: go down with him, and get what thou wantest thyself.”
      
      When Stubb reappeared, he came with a dark flask in one hand, and a
      sort of tea-caddy in the other. The first contained strong spirits, and
      was handed to Queequeg; the second was Aunt Charity’s gift, and that
      was freely given to the waves.
      
      
      CHAPTER 73. Stubb and Flask kill a Right Whale; and Then Have a Talk
      over Him.
      
      It must be borne in mind that all this time we have a Sperm Whale’s
      prodigious head hanging to the Pequod’s side. But we must let it
      continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to
      it. For the present other matters press, and the best we can do now for
      the head, is to pray heaven the tackles may hold.
      
      Now, during the past night and forenoon, the Pequod had gradually
      drifted into a sea, which, by its occasional patches of yellow brit,
      gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of Right Whales, a species of the
      Leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking
      anywhere near. And though all hands commonly disdained the capture of
      those inferior creatures; and though the Pequod was not commissioned to
      cruise for them at all, and though she had passed numbers of them near
      the Crozetts without lowering a boat; yet now that a Sperm Whale had
      been brought alongside and beheaded, to the surprise of all, the
      announcement was made that a Right Whale should be captured that day,
      if opportunity offered.
      
      Nor was this long wanting. Tall spouts were seen to leeward; and two
      boats, Stubb’s and Flask’s, were detached in pursuit. Pulling further
      and further away, they at last became almost invisible to the men at
      the mast-head. But suddenly in the distance, they saw a great heap of
      tumultuous white water, and soon after news came from aloft that one or
      both the boats must be fast. An interval passed and the boats were in
      plain sight, in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the
      towing whale. So close did the monster come to the hull, that at first
      it seemed as if he meant it malice; but suddenly going down in a
      maelstrom, within three rods of the planks, he wholly disappeared from
      view, as if diving under the keel. “Cut, cut!” was the cry from the
      ship to the boats, which, for one instant, seemed on the point of being
      brought with a deadly dash against the vessel’s side. But having plenty
      of line yet in the tubs, and the whale not sounding very rapidly, they
      paid out abundance of rope, and at the same time pulled with all their
      might so as to get ahead of the ship. For a few minutes the struggle
      was intensely critical; for while they still slacked out the tightened
      line in one direction, and still plied their oars in another, the
      contending strain threatened to take them under. But it was only a few
      feet advance they sought to gain. And they stuck to it till they did
      gain it; when instantly, a swift tremor was felt running like lightning
      along the keel, as the strained line, scraping beneath the ship,
      suddenly rose to view under her bows, snapping and quivering; and so
      flinging off its drippings, that the drops fell like bits of broken
      glass on the water, while the whale beyond also rose to sight, and once
      more the boats were free to fly. But the fagged whale abated his speed,
      and blindly altering his course, went round the stern of the ship
      towing the two boats after him, so that they performed a complete
      circuit.
      
      Meantime, they hauled more and more upon their lines, till close
      flanking him on both sides, Stubb answered Flask with lance for lance;
      and thus round and round the Pequod the battle went, while the
      multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the Sperm Whale’s body,
      rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled, thirstily drinking at every
      new gash, as the eager Israelites did at the new bursting fountains
      that poured from the smitten rock.
      
      At last his spout grew thick, and with a frightful roll and vomit, he
      turned upon his back a corpse.
      
      While the two headsmen were engaged in making fast cords to his flukes,
      and in other ways getting the mass in readiness for towing, some
      conversation ensued between them.
      
      “I wonder what the old man wants with this lump of foul lard,” said
      Stubb, not without some disgust at the thought of having to do with so
      ignoble a leviathan.
      
      “Wants with it?” said Flask, coiling some spare line in the boat’s bow,
      “did you never hear that the ship which but once has a Sperm Whale’s
      head hoisted on her starboard side, and at the same time a Right
      Whale’s on the larboard; did you never hear, Stubb, that that ship can
      never afterwards capsize?”
      
      “Why not?
      
      “I don’t know, but I heard that gamboge ghost of a Fedallah saying so,
      and he seems to know all about ships’ charms. But I sometimes think
      he’ll charm the ship to no good at last. I don’t half like that chap,
      Stubb. Did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved
      into a snake’s head, Stubb?”
      
      “Sink him! I never look at him at all; but if ever I get a chance of a
      dark night, and he standing hard by the bulwarks, and no one by; look
      down there, Flask”—pointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both
      hands—“Aye, will I! Flask, I take that Fedallah to be the devil in
      disguise. Do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been
      stowed away on board ship? He’s the devil, I say. The reason why you
      don’t see his tail, is because he tucks it up out of sight; he carries
      it coiled away in his pocket, I guess. Blast him! now that I think of
      it, he’s always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots.”
      
      “He sleeps in his boots, don’t he? He hasn’t got any hammock; but I’ve
      seen him lay of nights in a coil of rigging.”
      
      “No doubt, and it’s because of his cursed tail; he coils it down, do ye
      see, in the eye of the rigging.”
      
      “What’s the old man have so much to do with him for?”
      
      “Striking up a swap or a bargain, I suppose.”
      
      “Bargain?—about what?”
      
      “Why, do ye see, the old man is hard bent after that White Whale, and
      the devil there is trying to come round him, and get him to swap away
      his silver watch, or his soul, or something of that sort, and then
      he’ll surrender Moby Dick.”
      
      “Pooh! Stubb, you are skylarking; how can Fedallah do that?”
      
      “I don’t know, Flask, but the devil is a curious chap, and a wicked
      one, I tell ye. Why, they say as how he went a sauntering into the old
      flag-ship once, switching his tail about devilish easy and
      gentlemanlike, and inquiring if the old governor was at home. Well, he
      was at home, and asked the devil what he wanted. The devil, switching
      his hoofs, up and says, ‘I want John.’ ‘What for?’ says the old
      governor. ‘What business is that of yours,’ says the devil, getting
      mad,—‘I want to use him.’ ‘Take him,’ says the governor—and by the
      Lord, Flask, if the devil didn’t give John the Asiatic cholera before
      he got through with him, I’ll eat this whale in one mouthful. But look
      sharp—ain’t you all ready there? Well, then, pull ahead, and let’s get
      the whale alongside.”
      
      “I think I remember some such story as you were telling,” said Flask,
      when at last the two boats were slowly advancing with their burden
      towards the ship, “but I can’t remember where.”
      
      “Three Spaniards? Adventures of those three bloody-minded soldadoes?
      Did ye read it there, Flask? I guess ye did?”
      
      “No: never saw such a book; heard of it, though. But now, tell me,
      Stubb, do you suppose that that devil you was speaking of just now, was
      the same you say is now on board the Pequod?”
      
      “Am I the same man that helped kill this whale? Doesn’t the devil live
      for ever; who ever heard that the devil was dead? Did you ever see any
      parson a wearing mourning for the devil? And if the devil has a
      latch-key to get into the admiral’s cabin, don’t you suppose he can
      crawl into a porthole? Tell me that, Mr. Flask?”
      
      “How old do you suppose Fedallah is, Stubb?”
      
      “Do you see that mainmast there?” pointing to the ship; “well, that’s
      the figure one; now take all the hoops in the Pequod’s hold, and string
      along in a row with that mast, for oughts, do you see; well, that
      wouldn’t begin to be Fedallah’s age. Nor all the coopers in creation
      couldn’t show hoops enough to make oughts enough.”
      
      “But see here, Stubb, I thought you a little boasted just now, that you
      meant to give Fedallah a sea-toss, if you got a good chance. Now, if
      he’s so old as all those hoops of yours come to, and if he is going to
      live for ever, what good will it do to pitch him overboard—tell me
      that?
      
      “Give him a good ducking, anyhow.”
      
      “But he’d crawl back.”
      
      “Duck him again; and keep ducking him.”
      
      “Suppose he should take it into his head to duck you, though—yes, and
      drown you—what then?”
      
      “I should like to see him try it; I’d give him such a pair of black
      eyes that he wouldn’t dare to show his face in the admiral’s cabin
      again for a long while, let alone down in the orlop there, where he
      lives, and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much. Damn
      the devil, Flask; so you suppose I’m afraid of the devil? Who’s afraid
      of him, except the old governor who daresn’t catch him and put him in
      double-darbies, as he deserves, but lets him go about kidnapping
      people; aye, and signed a bond with him, that all the people the devil
      kidnapped, he’d roast for him? There’s a governor!”
      
      “Do you suppose Fedallah wants to kidnap Captain Ahab?”
      
      “Do I suppose it? You’ll know it before long, Flask. But I am going now
      to keep a sharp look-out on him; and if I see anything very suspicious
      going on, I’ll just take him by the nape of his neck, and say—Look
      here, Beelzebub, you don’t do it; and if he makes any fuss, by the Lord
      I’ll make a grab into his pocket for his tail, take it to the capstan,
      and give him such a wrenching and heaving, that his tail will come
      short off at the stump—do you see; and then, I rather guess when he
      finds himself docked in that queer fashion, he’ll sneak off without the
      poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs.”
      
      “And what will you do with the tail, Stubb?”
      
      “Do with it? Sell it for an ox whip when we get home;—what else?”
      
      “Now, do you mean what you say, and have been saying all along, Stubb?”
      
      “Mean or not mean, here we are at the ship.”
      
      The boats were here hailed, to tow the whale on the larboard side,
      where fluke chains and other necessaries were already prepared for
      securing him.
      
      “Didn’t I tell you so?” said Flask; “yes, you’ll soon see this right
      whale’s head hoisted up opposite that parmacetti’s.”
      
      In good time, Flask’s saying proved true. As before, the Pequod steeply
      leaned over towards the sperm whale’s head, now, by the counterpoise of
      both heads, she regained her even keel; though sorely strained, you may
      well believe. So, when on one side you hoist in Locke’s head, you go
      over that way; but now, on the other side, hoist in Kant’s and you come
      back again; but in very poor plight. Thus, some minds for ever keep
      trimming boat. Oh, ye foolish! throw all these thunder-heads overboard,
      and then you will float light and right.
      
      In disposing of the body of a right whale, when brought alongside the
      ship, the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the
      case of a sperm whale; only, in the latter instance, the head is cut
      off whole, but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed
      and hoisted on deck, with all the well known black bone attached to
      what is called the crown-piece. But nothing like this, in the present
      case, had been done. The carcases of both whales had dropped astern;
      and the head-laden ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair
      of overburdening panniers.
      
      Meantime, Fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whale’s head, and ever
      and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own
      hand. And Ahab chanced so to stand, that the Parsee occupied his
      shadow; while, if the Parsee’s shadow was there at all it seemed only
      to blend with, and lengthen Ahab’s. As the crew toiled on, Laplandish
      speculations were bandied among them, concerning all these passing
      things.
      
      
      CHAPTER 74. The Sperm Whale’s Head—Contrasted View.
      
      Here, now, are two great whales, laying their heads together; let us
      join them, and lay together our own.
      
      Of the grand order of folio leviathans, the Sperm Whale and the Right
      Whale are by far the most noteworthy. They are the only whales
      regularly hunted by man. To the Nantucketer, they present the two
      extremes of all the known varieties of the whale. As the external
      difference between them is mainly observable in their heads; and as a
      head of each is this moment hanging from the Pequod’s side; and as we
      may freely go from one to the other, by merely stepping across the
      deck:—where, I should like to know, will you obtain a better chance to
      study practical cetology than here?
      
      In the first place, you are struck by the general contrast between
      these heads. Both are massive enough in all conscience; but there is a
      certain mathematical symmetry in the Sperm Whale’s which the Right
      Whale’s sadly lacks. There is more character in the Sperm Whale’s head.
      As you behold it, you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to
      him, in point of pervading dignity. In the present instance, too, this
      dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the
      summit, giving token of advanced age and large experience. In short, he
      is what the fishermen technically call a “grey-headed whale.”
      
      Let us now note what is least dissimilar in these heads—namely, the two
      most important organs, the eye and the ear. Far back on the side of the
      head, and low down, near the angle of either whale’s jaw, if you
      narrowly search, you will at last see a lashless eye, which you would
      fancy to be a young colt’s eye; so out of all proportion is it to the
      magnitude of the head.
      
      Now, from this peculiar sideway position of the whale’s eyes, it is
      plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead, no more
      than he can one exactly astern. In a word, the position of the whale’s
      eyes corresponds to that of a man’s ears; and you may fancy, for
      yourself, how it would fare with you, did you sideways survey objects
      through your ears. You would find that you could only command some
      thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight side-line of sight;
      and about thirty more behind it. If your bitterest foe were walking
      straight towards you, with dagger uplifted in broad day, you would not
      be able to see him, any more than if he were stealing upon you from
      behind. In a word, you would have two backs, so to speak; but, at the
      same time, also, two fronts (side fronts): for what is it that makes
      the front of a man—what, indeed, but his eyes?
      
      Moreover, while in most other animals that I can now think of, the eyes
      are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power, so as to
      produce one picture and not two to the brain; the peculiar position of
      the whale’s eyes, effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of
      solid head, which towers between them like a great mountain separating
      two lakes in valleys; this, of course, must wholly separate the
      impressions which each independent organ imparts. The whale, therefore,
      must see one distinct picture on this side, and another distinct
      picture on that side; while all between must be profound darkness and
      nothingness to him. Man may, in effect, be said to look out on the
      world from a sentry-box with two joined sashes for his window. But with
      the whale, these two sashes are separately inserted, making two
      distinct windows, but sadly impairing the view. This peculiarity of the
      whale’s eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery; and
      to be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes.
      
      A curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this
      visual matter as touching the Leviathan. But I must be content with a
      hint. So long as a man’s eyes are open in the light, the act of seeing
      is involuntary; that is, he cannot then help mechanically seeing
      whatever objects are before him. Nevertheless, any one’s experience
      will teach him, that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of
      things at one glance, it is quite impossible for him, attentively, and
      completely, to examine any two things—however large or however small—at
      one and the same instant of time; never mind if they lie side by side
      and touch each other. But if you now come to separate these two
      objects, and surround each by a circle of profound darkness; then, in
      order to see one of them, in such a manner as to bring your mind to
      bear on it, the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary
      consciousness. How is it, then, with the whale? True, both his eyes, in
      themselves, must simultaneously act; but is his brain so much more
      comprehensive, combining, and subtle than man’s, that he can at the
      same moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects, one on
      one side of him, and the other in an exactly opposite direction? If he
      can, then is it as marvellous a thing in him, as if a man were able
      simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct
      problems in Euclid. Nor, strictly investigated, is there any
      incongruity in this comparison.
      
      It may be but an idle whim, but it has always seemed to me, that the
      extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when
      beset by three or four boats; the timidity and liability to queer
      frights, so common to such whales; I think that all this indirectly
      proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition, in which their
      divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them.
      
      But the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye. If you are an
      entire stranger to their race, you might hunt over these two heads for
      hours, and never discover that organ. The ear has no external leaf
      whatever; and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill, so
      wondrously minute is it. It is lodged a little behind the eye. With
      respect to their ears, this important difference is to be observed
      between the sperm whale and the right. While the ear of the former has
      an external opening, that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered
      over with a membrane, so as to be quite imperceptible from without.
      
      Is it not curious, that so vast a being as the whale should see the
      world through so small an eye, and hear the thunder through an ear
      which is smaller than a hare’s? But if his eyes were broad as the lens
      of Herschel’s great telescope; and his ears capacious as the porches of
      cathedrals; would that make him any longer of sight, or sharper of
      hearing? Not at all.—Why then do you try to “enlarge” your mind?
      Subtilize it.
      
      Let us now with whatever levers and steam-engines we have at hand, cant
      over the sperm whale’s head, that it may lie bottom up; then, ascending
      by a ladder to the summit, have a peep down the mouth; and were it not
      that the body is now completely separated from it, with a lantern we
      might descend into the great Kentucky Mammoth Cave of his stomach. But
      let us hold on here by this tooth, and look about us where we are. What
      a really beautiful and chaste-looking mouth! from floor to ceiling,
      lined, or rather papered with a glistening white membrane, glossy as
      bridal satins.
      
      But come out now, and look at this portentous lower jaw, which seems
      like the long narrow lid of an immense snuff-box, with the hinge at one
      end, instead of one side. If you pry it up, so as to get it overhead,
      and expose its rows of teeth, it seems a terrific portcullis; and such,
      alas! it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery, upon whom these
      spikes fall with impaling force. But far more terrible is it to behold,
      when fathoms down in the sea, you see some sulky whale, floating there
      suspended, with his prodigious jaw, some fifteen feet long, hanging
      straight down at right-angles with his body, for all the world like a
      ship’s jib-boom. This whale is not dead; he is only dispirited; out of
      sorts, perhaps; hypochondriac; and so supine, that the hinges of his
      jaw have relaxed, leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight, a
      reproach to all his tribe, who must, no doubt, imprecate lock-jaws upon
      him.
      
      In most cases this lower jaw—being easily unhinged by a practised
      artist—is disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting
      the ivory teeth, and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone
      with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles,
      including canes, umbrella-stocks, and handles to riding-whips.
      
      With a long, weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board, as if it were an
      anchor; and when the proper time comes—some few days after the other
      work—Queequeg, Daggoo, and Tashtego, being all accomplished dentists,
      are set to drawing teeth. With a keen cutting-spade, Queequeg lances
      the gums; then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts, and a tackle being
      rigged from aloft, they drag out these teeth, as Michigan oxen drag
      stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands. There are generally
      forty-two teeth in all; in old whales, much worn down, but undecayed;
      nor filled after our artificial fashion. The jaw is afterwards sawn
      into slabs, and piled away like joists for building houses.
      
      
      CHAPTER 75. The Right Whale’s Head—Contrasted View.
      
      Crossing the deck, let us now have a good long look at the Right
      Whale’s head.
      
      As in general shape the noble Sperm Whale’s head may be compared to a
      Roman war-chariot (especially in front, where it is so broadly
      rounded); so, at a broad view, the Right Whale’s head bears a rather
      inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliot-toed shoe. Two hundred
      years ago an old Dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a
      shoemaker’s last. And in this same last or shoe, that old woman of the
      nursery tale, with the swarming brood, might very comfortably be
      lodged, she and all her progeny.
      
      But as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different
      aspects, according to your point of view. If you stand on its summit
      and look at these two F-shaped spoutholes, you would take the whole
      head for an enormous bass-viol, and these spiracles, the apertures in
      its sounding-board. Then, again, if you fix your eye upon this strange,
      crested, comb-like incrustation on the top of the mass—this green,
      barnacled thing, which the Greenlanders call the “crown,” and the
      Southern fishers the “bonnet” of the Right Whale; fixing your eyes
      solely on this, you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak,
      with a bird’s nest in its crotch. At any rate, when you watch those
      live crabs that nestle here on this bonnet, such an idea will be almost
      sure to occur to you; unless, indeed, your fancy has been fixed by the
      technical term “crown” also bestowed upon it; in which case you will
      take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a
      diademed king of the sea, whose green crown has been put together for
      him in this marvellous manner. But if this whale be a king, he is a
      very sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem. Look at that hanging lower
      lip! what a huge sulk and pout is there! a sulk and pout, by
      carpenter’s measurement, about twenty feet long and five feet deep; a
      sulk and pout that will yield you some 500 gallons of oil and more.
      
      A great pity, now, that this unfortunate whale should be hare-lipped.
      The fissure is about a foot across. Probably the mother during an
      important interval was sailing down the Peruvian coast, when
      earthquakes caused the beach to gape. Over this lip, as over a slippery
      threshold, we now slide into the mouth. Upon my word were I at
      Mackinaw, I should take this to be the inside of an Indian wigwam. Good
      Lord! is this the road that Jonah went? The roof is about twelve feet
      high, and runs to a pretty sharp angle, as if there were a regular
      ridge-pole there; while these ribbed, arched, hairy sides, present us
      with those wondrous, half vertical, scimetar-shaped slats of whalebone,
      say three hundred on a side, which depending from the upper part of the
      head or crown bone, form those Venetian blinds which have elsewhere
      been cursorily mentioned. The edges of these bones are fringed with
      hairy fibres, through which the Right Whale strains the water, and in
      whose intricacies he retains the small fish, when openmouthed he goes
      through the seas of brit in feeding time. In the central blinds of
      bone, as they stand in their natural order, there are certain curious
      marks, curves, hollows, and ridges, whereby some whalemen calculate the
      creature’s age, as the age of an oak by its circular rings. Though the
      certainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable, yet it has the
      savor of analogical probability. At any rate, if we yield to it, we
      must grant a far greater age to the Right Whale than at first glance
      will seem reasonable.
      
      In old times, there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies
      concerning these blinds. One voyager in Purchas calls them the wondrous
      “whiskers” inside of the whale’s mouth;* another, “hogs’ bristles”; a
      third old gentleman in Hackluyt uses the following elegant language:
      “There are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his
      upper _chop_, which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth.”
      
      *This reminds us that the Right Whale really has a sort of whisker, or
      rather a moustache, consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the
      upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw. Sometimes these tufts
      impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn
      countenance.
      
      As every one knows, these same “hogs’ bristles,” “fins,” “whiskers,”
      “blinds,” or whatever you please, furnish to the ladies their busks and
      other stiffening contrivances. But in this particular, the demand has
      long been on the decline. It was in Queen Anne’s time that the bone was
      in its glory, the farthingale being then all the fashion. And as those
      ancient dames moved about gaily, though in the jaws of the whale, as
      you may say; even so, in a shower, with the like thoughtlessness, do we
      nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection; the umbrella being a
      tent spread over the same bone.
      
      But now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment, and,
      standing in the Right Whale’s mouth, look around you afresh. Seeing all
      these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about, would you not
      think you were inside of the great Haarlem organ, and gazing upon its
      thousand pipes? For a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest
      Turkey—the tongue, which is glued, as it were, to the floor of the
      mouth. It is very fat and tender, and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting
      it on deck. This particular tongue now before us; at a passing glance I
      should say it was a six-barreler; that is, it will yield you about that
      amount of oil.
      
      Ere this, you must have plainly seen the truth of what I started
      with—that the Sperm Whale and the Right Whale have almost entirely
      different heads. To sum up, then: in the Right Whale’s there is no
      great well of sperm; no ivory teeth at all; no long, slender mandible
      of a lower jaw, like the Sperm Whale’s. Nor in the Sperm Whale are
      there any of those blinds of bone; no huge lower lip; and scarcely
      anything of a tongue. Again, the Right Whale has two external
      spout-holes, the Sperm Whale only one.
      
      Look your last, now, on these venerable hooded heads, while they yet
      lie together; for one will soon sink, unrecorded, in the sea; the other
      will not be very long in following.
      
      Can you catch the expression of the Sperm Whale’s there? It is the same
      he died with, only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now
      faded away. I think his broad brow to be full of a prairie-like
      placidity, born of a speculative indifference as to death. But mark the
      other head’s expression. See that amazing lower lip, pressed by
      accident against the vessel’s side, so as firmly to embrace the jaw.
      Does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical
      resolution in facing death? This Right Whale I take to have been a
      Stoic; the Sperm Whale, a Platonian, who might have taken up Spinoza in
      his latter years.
      
      
      CHAPTER 76. The Battering-Ram.
      
      Ere quitting, for the nonce, the Sperm Whale’s head, I would have you,
      as a sensible physiologist, simply—particularly remark its front
      aspect, in all its compacted collectedness. I would have you
      investigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some
      unexaggerated, intelligent estimate of whatever battering-ram power may
      be lodged there. Here is a vital point; for you must either
      satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself, or for ever remain an
      infidel as to one of the most appalling, but not the less true events,
      perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history.
      
      You observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the Sperm Whale,
      the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the
      water; you observe that the lower part of that front slopes
      considerably backwards, so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long
      socket which receives the boom-like lower jaw; you observe that the
      mouth is entirely under the head, much in the same way, indeed, as
      though your own mouth were entirely under your chin. Moreover you
      observe that the whale has no external nose; and that what nose he
      has—his spout hole—is on the top of his head; you observe that his eyes
      and ears are at the sides of his head, nearly one third of his entire
      length from the front. Wherefore, you must now have perceived that the
      front of the Sperm Whale’s head is a dead, blind wall, without a single
      organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever. Furthermore, you are
      now to consider that only in the extreme, lower, backward sloping part
      of the front of the head, is there the slightest vestige of bone; and
      not till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the
      full cranial development. So that this whole enormous boneless mass is
      as one wad. Finally, though, as will soon be revealed, its contents
      partly comprise the most delicate oil; yet, you are now to be apprised
      of the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all that
      apparent effeminacy. In some previous place I have described to you how
      the blubber wraps the body of the whale, as the rind wraps an orange.
      Just so with the head; but with this difference: about the head this
      envelope, though not so thick, is of a boneless toughness, inestimable
      by any man who has not handled it. The severest pointed harpoon, the
      sharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm, impotently rebounds
      from it. It is as though the forehead of the Sperm Whale were paved
      with horses’ hoofs. I do not think that any sensation lurks in it.
      
      Bethink yourself also of another thing. When two large, loaded Indiamen
      chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks, what do the
      sailors do? They do not suspend between them, at the point of coming
      contact, any merely hard substance, like iron or wood. No, they hold
      there a large, round wad of tow and cork, enveloped in the thickest and
      toughest of ox-hide. That bravely and uninjured takes the jam which
      would have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crow-bars. By
      itself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact I drive at. But
      supplementary to this, it has hypothetically occurred to me, that as
      ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them,
      capable, at will, of distension or contraction; and as the Sperm Whale,
      as far as I know, has no such provision in him; considering, too, the
      otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head
      altogether beneath the surface, and anon swims with it high elevated
      out of the water; considering the unobstructed elasticity of its
      envelope; considering the unique interior of his head; it has
      hypothetically occurred to me, I say, that those mystical lung-celled
      honeycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and
      unsuspected connexion with the outer air, so as to be susceptible to
      atmospheric distension and contraction. If this be so, fancy the
      irresistibleness of that might, to which the most impalpable and
      destructive of all elements contributes.
      
      Now, mark. Unerringly impelling this dead, impregnable, uninjurable
      wall, and this most buoyant thing within; there swims behind it all a
      mass of tremendous life, only to be adequately estimated as piled wood
      is—by the cord; and all obedient to one volition, as the smallest
      insect. So that when I shall hereafter detail to you all the
      specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this
      expansive monster; when I shall show you some of his more
      inconsiderable braining feats; I trust you will have renounced all
      ignorant incredulity, and be ready to abide by this; that though the
      Sperm Whale stove a passage through the Isthmus of Darien, and mixed
      the Atlantic with the Pacific, you would not elevate one hair of your
      eye-brow. For unless you own the whale, you are but a provincial and
      sentimentalist in Truth. But clear Truth is a thing for salamander
      giants only to encounter; how small the chances for the provincials
      then? What befell the weakling youth lifting the dread goddess’s veil
      at Lais?
      
      
      CHAPTER 77. The Great Heidelburgh Tun.
      
      Now comes the Baling of the Case. But to comprehend it aright, you must
      know something of the curious internal structure of the thing operated
      upon.
      
      Regarding the Sperm Whale’s head as a solid oblong, you may, on an
      inclined plane, sideways divide it into two quoins,* whereof the lower
      is the bony structure, forming the cranium and jaws, and the upper an
      unctuous mass wholly free from bones; its broad forward end forming the
      expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale. At the middle of the
      forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin, and then you have two
      almost equal parts, which before were naturally divided by an internal
      wall of a thick tendinous substance.
      
      *Quoin is not a Euclidean term. It belongs to the pure nautical
      mathematics. I know not that it has been defined before. A quoin is a
      solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the
      steep inclination of one side, instead of the mutual tapering of both
      sides.
      
      The lower subdivided part, called the junk, is one immense honeycomb of
      oil, formed by the crossing and recrossing, into ten thousand
      infiltrated cells, of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole
      extent. The upper part, known as the Case, may be regarded as the great
      Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale. And as that famous great tierce is
      mystically carved in front, so the whale’s vast plaited forehead forms
      innumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his
      wondrous tun. Moreover, as that of Heidelburgh was always replenished
      with the most excellent of the wines of the Rhenish valleys, so the tun
      of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily
      vintages; namely, the highly-prized spermaceti, in its absolutely pure,
      limpid, and odoriferous state. Nor is this precious substance found
      unalloyed in any other part of the creature. Though in life it remains
      perfectly fluid, yet, upon exposure to the air, after death, it soon
      begins to concrete; sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots, as when
      the first thin delicate ice is just forming in water. A large whale’s
      case generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm, though from
      unavoidable circumstances, considerable of it is spilled, leaks, and
      dribbles away, or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish
      business of securing what you can.
      
      I know not with what fine and costly material the Heidelburgh Tun was
      coated within, but in superlative richness that coating could not
      possibly have compared with the silken pearl-coloured membrane, like
      the lining of a fine pelisse, forming the inner surface of the Sperm
      Whale’s case.
      
      It will have been seen that the Heidelburgh Tun of the Sperm Whale
      embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head; and since—as
      has been elsewhere set forth—the head embraces one third of the whole
      length of the creature, then setting that length down at eighty feet
      for a good sized whale, you have more than twenty-six feet for the
      depth of the tun, when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a
      ship’s side.
      
      As in decapitating the whale, the operator’s instrument is brought
      close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the
      spermaceti magazine; he has, therefore, to be uncommonly heedful, lest
      a careless, untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly
      let out its invaluable contents. It is this decapitated end of the
      head, also, which is at last elevated out of the water, and retained in
      that position by the enormous cutting tackles, whose hempen
      combinations, on one side, make quite a wilderness of ropes in that
      quarter.
      
      Thus much being said, attend now, I pray you, to that marvellous and—in
      this particular instance—almost fatal operation whereby the Sperm
      Whale’s great Heidelburgh Tun is tapped.
      
      
      CHAPTER 78. Cistern and Buckets.
      
      Nimble as a cat, Tashtego mounts aloft; and without altering his erect
      posture, runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyard-arm, to the
      part where it exactly projects over the hoisted Tun. He has carried
      with him a light tackle called a whip, consisting of only two parts,
      travelling through a single-sheaved block. Securing this block, so that
      it hangs down from the yard-arm, he swings one end of the rope, till it
      is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck. Then, hand-over-hand, down
      the other part, the Indian drops through the air, till dexterously he
      lands on the summit of the head. There—still high elevated above the
      rest of the company, to whom he vivaciously cries—he seems some Turkish
      Muezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower. A
      short-handled sharp spade being sent up to him, he diligently searches
      for the proper place to begin breaking into the Tun. In this business
      he proceeds very heedfully, like a treasure-hunter in some old house,
      sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in. By the time
      this cautious search is over, a stout iron-bound bucket, precisely like
      a well-bucket, has been attached to one end of the whip; while the
      other end, being stretched across the deck, is there held by two or
      three alert hands. These last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the
      Indian, to whom another person has reached up a very long pole.
      Inserting this pole into the bucket, Tashtego downward guides the
      bucket into the Tun, till it entirely disappears; then giving the word
      to the seamen at the whip, up comes the bucket again, all bubbling like
      a dairy-maid’s pail of new milk. Carefully lowered from its height, the
      full-freighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand, and quickly
      emptied into a large tub. Then remounting aloft, it again goes through
      the same round until the deep cistern will yield no more. Towards the
      end, Tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder, and deeper
      and deeper into the Tun, until some twenty feet of the pole have gone
      down.
      
      Now, the people of the Pequod had been baling some time in this way;
      several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm; when all at once
      a queer accident happened. Whether it was that Tashtego, that wild
      Indian, was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his
      one-handed hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head; or
      whether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy; or
      whether the Evil One himself would have it to fall out so, without
      stating his particular reasons; how it was exactly, there is no telling
      now; but, on a sudden, as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came
      suckingly up—my God! poor Tashtego—like the twin reciprocating bucket
      in a veritable well, dropped head-foremost down into this great Tun of
      Heidelburgh, and with a horrible oily gurgling, went clean out of
      sight!
      
      “Man overboard!” cried Daggoo, who amid the general consternation first
      came to his senses. “Swing the bucket this way!” and putting one foot
      into it, so as the better to secure his slippery hand-hold on the whip
      itself, the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head, almost
      before Tashtego could have reached its interior bottom. Meantime, there
      was a terrible tumult. Looking over the side, they saw the before
      lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea,
      as if that moment seized with some momentous idea; whereas it was only
      the poor Indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous
      depth to which he had sunk.
      
      At this instant, while Daggoo, on the summit of the head, was clearing
      the whip—which had somehow got foul of the great cutting tackles—a
      sharp cracking noise was heard; and to the unspeakable horror of all,
      one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out, and with a
      vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung, till the drunk ship
      reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg. The one remaining hook,
      upon which the entire strain now depended, seemed every instant to be
      on the point of giving way; an event still more likely from the violent
      motions of the head.
      
      “Come down, come down!” yelled the seamen to Daggoo, but with one hand
      holding on to the heavy tackles, so that if the head should drop, he
      would still remain suspended; the negro having cleared the foul line,
      rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well, meaning that the
      buried harpooneer should grasp it, and so be hoisted out.
      
      “In heaven’s name, man,” cried Stubb, “are you ramming home a cartridge
      there?—Avast! How will that help him; jamming that iron-bound bucket on
      top of his head? Avast, will ye!”
      
      “Stand clear of the tackle!” cried a voice like the bursting of a
      rocket.
      
      Almost in the same instant, with a thunder-boom, the enormous mass
      dropped into the sea, like Niagara’s Table-Rock into the whirlpool; the
      suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it, to far down her glittering
      copper; and all caught their breath, as half swinging—now over the
      sailors’ heads, and now over the water—Daggoo, through a thick mist of
      spray, was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles, while poor,
      buried-alive Tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the
      sea! But hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away, when a naked
      figure with a boarding-sword in his hand, was for one swift moment seen
      hovering over the bulwarks. The next, a loud splash announced that my
      brave Queequeg had dived to the rescue. One packed rush was made to the
      side, and every eye counted every ripple, as moment followed moment,
      and no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen. Some hands
      now jumped into a boat alongside, and pushed a little off from the
      ship.
      
      “Ha! ha!” cried Daggoo, all at once, from his now quiet, swinging perch
      overhead; and looking further off from the side, we saw an arm thrust
      upright from the blue waves; a sight strange to see, as an arm thrust
      forth from the grass over a grave.
      
      “Both! both!—it is both!”—cried Daggoo again with a joyful shout; and
      soon after, Queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand, and
      with the other clutching the long hair of the Indian. Drawn into the
      waiting boat, they were quickly brought to the deck; but Tashtego was
      long in coming to, and Queequeg did not look very brisk.
      
      Now, how had this noble rescue been accomplished? Why, diving after the
      slowly descending head, Queequeg with his keen sword had made side
      lunges near its bottom, so as to scuttle a large hole there; then
      dropping his sword, had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards,
      and so hauled out poor Tash by the head. He averred, that upon first
      thrusting in for him, a leg was presented; but well knowing that that
      was not as it ought to be, and might occasion great trouble;—he had
      thrust back the leg, and by a dexterous heave and toss, had wrought a
      somerset upon the Indian; so that with the next trial, he came forth in
      the good old way—head foremost. As for the great head itself, that was
      doing as well as could be expected.
      
      And thus, through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of
      Queequeg, the deliverance, or rather, delivery of Tashtego, was
      successfully accomplished, in the teeth, too, of the most untoward and
      apparently hopeless impediments; which is a lesson by no means to be
      forgotten. Midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing
      and boxing, riding and rowing.
      
      I know that this queer adventure of the Gay-Header’s will be sure to
      seem incredible to some landsmen, though they themselves may have
      either seen or heard of some one’s falling into a cistern ashore; an
      accident which not seldom happens, and with much less reason too than
      the Indian’s, considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the
      Sperm Whale’s well.
      
      But, peradventure, it may be sagaciously urged, how is this? We thought
      the tissued, infiltrated head of the Sperm Whale, was the lightest and
      most corky part about him; and yet thou makest it sink in an element of
      a far greater specific gravity than itself. We have thee there. Not at
      all, but I have ye; for at the time poor Tash fell in, the case had
      been nearly emptied of its lighter contents, leaving little but the
      dense tendinous wall of the well—a double welded, hammered substance,
      as I have before said, much heavier than the sea water, and a lump of
      which sinks in it like lead almost. But the tendency to rapid sinking
      in this substance was in the present instance materially counteracted
      by the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it, so that it
      sank very slowly and deliberately indeed, affording Queequeg a fair
      chance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run, as you may say.
      Yes, it was a running delivery, so it was.
      
      Now, had Tashtego perished in that head, it had been a very precious
      perishing; smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant
      spermaceti; coffined, hearsed, and tombed in the secret inner chamber
      and sanctum sanctorum of the whale. Only one sweeter end can readily be
      recalled—the delicious death of an Ohio honey-hunter, who seeking honey
      in the crotch of a hollow tree, found such exceeding store of it, that
      leaning too far over, it sucked him in, so that he died embalmed. How
      many, think ye, have likewise fallen into Plato’s honey head, and
      sweetly perished there?
      
      
      CHAPTER 79. The Prairie.
      
      To scan the lines of his face, or feel the bumps on the head of this
      Leviathan; this is a thing which no Physiognomist or Phrenologist has
      as yet undertaken. Such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as
      for Lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the Rock of Gibraltar,
      or for Gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the Dome of the
      Pantheon. Still, in that famous work of his, Lavater not only treats of
      the various faces of men, but also attentively studies the faces of
      horses, birds, serpents, and fish; and dwells in detail upon the
      modifications of expression discernible therein. Nor have Gall and his
      disciple Spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the
      phrenological characteristics of other beings than man. Therefore,
      though I am but ill qualified for a pioneer, in the application of
      these two semi-sciences to the whale, I will do my endeavor. I try all
      things; I achieve what I can.
      
      Physiognomically regarded, the Sperm Whale is an anomalous creature. He
      has no proper nose. And since the nose is the central and most
      conspicuous of the features; and since it perhaps most modifies and
      finally controls their combined expression; hence it would seem that
      its entire absence, as an external appendage, must very largely affect
      the countenance of the whale. For as in landscape gardening, a spire,
      cupola, monument, or tower of some sort, is deemed almost indispensable
      to the completion of the scene; so no face can be physiognomically in
      keeping without the elevated open-work belfry of the nose. Dash the
      nose from Phidias’s marble Jove, and what a sorry remainder!
      Nevertheless, Leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude, all his
      proportions are so stately, that the same deficiency which in the
      sculptured Jove were hideous, in him is no blemish at all. Nay, it is
      an added grandeur. A nose to the whale would have been impertinent. As
      on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your
      jolly-boat, your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the
      reflection that he has a nose to be pulled. A pestilent conceit, which
      so often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest
      royal beadle on his throne.
      
      In some particulars, perhaps the most imposing physiognomical view to
      be had of the Sperm Whale, is that of the full front of his head. This
      aspect is sublime.
      
      In thought, a fine human brow is like the East when troubled with the
      morning. In the repose of the pasture, the curled brow of the bull has
      a touch of the grand in it. Pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles,
      the elephant’s brow is majestic. Human or animal, the mystical brow is
      as that great golden seal affixed by the German emperors to their
      decrees. It signifies—“God: done this day by my hand.” But in most
      creatures, nay in man himself, very often the brow is but a mere strip
      of alpine land lying along the snow line. Few are the foreheads which
      like Shakespeare’s or Melancthon’s rise so high, and descend so low,
      that the eyes themselves seem clear, eternal, tideless mountain lakes;
      and all above them in the forehead’s wrinkles, you seem to track the
      antlered thoughts descending there to drink, as the Highland hunters
      track the snow prints of the deer. But in the great Sperm Whale, this
      high and mighty god-like dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely
      amplified, that gazing on it, in that full front view, you feel the
      Deity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other
      object in living nature. For you see no one point precisely; not one
      distinct feature is revealed; no nose, eyes, ears, or mouth; no face;
      he has none, proper; nothing but that one broad firmament of a
      forehead, pleated with riddles; dumbly lowering with the doom of boats,
      and ships, and men. Nor, in profile, does this wondrous brow diminish;
      though that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so. In
      profile, you plainly perceive that horizontal, semi-crescentic
      depression in the forehead’s middle, which, in man, is Lavater’s mark
      of genius.
      
      But how? Genius in the Sperm Whale? Has the Sperm Whale ever written a
      book, spoken a speech? No, his great genius is declared in his doing
      nothing particular to prove it. It is moreover declared in his
      pyramidical silence. And this reminds me that had the great Sperm Whale
      been known to the young Orient World, he would have been deified by
      their child-magian thoughts. They deified the crocodile of the Nile,
      because the crocodile is tongueless; and the Sperm Whale has no tongue,
      or at least it is so exceedingly small, as to be incapable of
      protrusion. If hereafter any highly cultured, poetical nation shall
      lure back to their birth-right, the merry May-day gods of old; and
      livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky; in the now
      unhaunted hill; then be sure, exalted to Jove’s high seat, the great
      Sperm Whale shall lord it.
      
      Champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics. But there is
      no Champollion to decipher the Egypt of every man’s and every being’s
      face. Physiognomy, like every other human science, is but a passing
      fable. If then, Sir William Jones, who read in thirty languages, could
      not read the simplest peasant’s face in its profounder and more subtle
      meanings, how may unlettered Ishmael hope to read the awful Chaldee of
      the Sperm Whale’s brow? I but put that brow before you. Read it if you
      can.
      
      
      CHAPTER 80. The Nut.
      
      If the Sperm Whale be physiognomically a Sphinx, to the phrenologist
      his brain seems that geometrical circle which it is impossible to
      square.
      
      In the full-grown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet
      in length. Unhinge the lower jaw, and the side view of this skull is as
      the side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level
      base. But in life—as we have elsewhere seen—this inclined plane is
      angularly filled up, and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent
      mass of the junk and sperm. At the high end the skull forms a crater to
      bed that part of the mass; while under the long floor of this crater—in
      another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in
      depth—reposes the mere handful of this monster’s brain. The brain is at
      least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life; it is hidden away
      behind its vast outworks, like the innermost citadel within the
      amplified fortifications of Quebec. So like a choice casket is it
      secreted in him, that I have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny
      that the Sperm Whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance
      of one formed by the cubic-yards of his sperm magazine. Lying in
      strange folds, courses, and convolutions, to their apprehensions, it
      seems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that
      mystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence.
      
      It is plain, then, that phrenologically the head of this Leviathan, in
      the creature’s living intact state, is an entire delusion. As for his
      true brain, you can then see no indications of it, nor feel any. The
      whale, like all things that are mighty, wears a false brow to the
      common world.
      
      If you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view
      of its rear end, which is the high end, you will be struck by its
      resemblance to the human skull, beheld in the same situation, and from
      the same point of view. Indeed, place this reversed skull (scaled down
      to the human magnitude) among a plate of men’s skulls, and you would
      involuntarily confound it with them; and remarking the depressions on
      one part of its summit, in phrenological phrase you would say—This man
      had no self-esteem, and no veneration. And by those negations,
      considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and
      power, you can best form to yourself the truest, though not the most
      exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is.
      
      But if from the comparative dimensions of the whale’s proper brain, you
      deem it incapable of being adequately charted, then I have another idea
      for you. If you attentively regard almost any quadruped’s spine, you
      will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebræ to a strung
      necklace of dwarfed skulls, all bearing rudimental resemblance to the
      skull proper. It is a German conceit, that the vertebræ are absolutely
      undeveloped skulls. But the curious external resemblance, I take it the
      Germans were not the first men to perceive. A foreign friend once
      pointed it out to me, in the skeleton of a foe he had slain, and with
      the vertebræ of which he was inlaying, in a sort of basso-relievo, the
      beaked prow of his canoe. Now, I consider that the phrenologists have
      omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the
      cerebellum through the spinal canal. For I believe that much of a man’s
      character will be found betokened in his backbone. I would rather feel
      your spine than your skull, whoever you are. A thin joist of a spine
      never yet upheld a full and noble soul. I rejoice in my spine, as in
      the firm audacious staff of that flag which I fling half out to the
      world.
      
      Apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the Sperm Whale. His cranial
      cavity is continuous with the first neck-vertebra; and in that vertebra
      the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across, being
      eight in height, and of a triangular figure with the base downwards. As
      it passes through the remaining vertebræ the canal tapers in size, but
      for a considerable distance remains of large capacity. Now, of course,
      this canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substance—the
      spinal cord—as the brain; and directly communicates with the brain. And
      what is still more, for many feet after emerging from the brain’s
      cavity, the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth, almost equal
      to that of the brain. Under all these circumstances, would it be
      unreasonable to survey and map out the whale’s spine phrenologically?
      For, viewed in this light, the wonderful comparative smallness of his
      brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative
      magnitude of his spinal cord.
      
      But leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists, I
      would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment, in reference to the
      Sperm Whale’s hump. This august hump, if I mistake not, rises over one
      of the larger vertebræ, and is, therefore, in some sort, the outer
      convex mould of it. From its relative situation then, I should call
      this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the Sperm
      Whale. And that the great monster is indomitable, you will yet have
      reason to know.
      
      
      CHAPTER 81. The Pequod Meets The Virgin.
      
      The predestinated day arrived, and we duly met the ship Jungfrau,
      Derick De Deer, master, of Bremen.
      
      At one time the greatest whaling people in the world, the Dutch and
      Germans are now among the least; but here and there at very wide
      intervals of latitude and longitude, you still occasionally meet with
      their flag in the Pacific.
      
      For some reason, the Jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects.
      While yet some distance from the Pequod, she rounded to, and dropping a
      boat, her captain was impelled towards us, impatiently standing in the
      bows instead of the stern.
      
      “What has he in his hand there?” cried Starbuck, pointing to something
      wavingly held by the German. “Impossible!—a lamp-feeder!”
      
      “Not that,” said Stubb, “no, no, it’s a coffee-pot, Mr. Starbuck; he’s
      coming off to make us our coffee, is the Yarman; don’t you see that big
      tin can there alongside of him?—that’s his boiling water. Oh! he’s all
      right, is the Yarman.”
      
      “Go along with you,” cried Flask, “it’s a lamp-feeder and an oil-can.
      He’s out of oil, and has come a-begging.”
      
      However curious it may seem for an oil-ship to be borrowing oil on the
      whale-ground, and however much it may invertedly contradict the old
      proverb about carrying coals to Newcastle, yet sometimes such a thing
      really happens; and in the present case Captain Derick De Deer did
      indubitably conduct a lamp-feeder as Flask did declare.
      
      As he mounted the deck, Ahab abruptly accosted him, without at all
      heeding what he had in his hand; but in his broken lingo, the German
      soon evinced his complete ignorance of the White Whale; immediately
      turning the conversation to his lamp-feeder and oil can, with some
      remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in
      profound darkness—his last drop of Bremen oil being gone, and not a
      single flying-fish yet captured to supply the deficiency; concluding by
      hinting that his ship was indeed what in the Fishery is technically
      called a _clean_ one (that is, an empty one), well deserving the name
      of Jungfrau or the Virgin.
      
      His necessities supplied, Derick departed; but he had not gained his
      ship’s side, when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the
      mast-heads of both vessels; and so eager for the chase was Derick, that
      without pausing to put his oil-can and lamp-feeder aboard, he slewed
      round his boat and made after the leviathan lamp-feeders.
      
      Now, the game having risen to leeward, he and the other three German
      boats that soon followed him, had considerably the start of the
      Pequod’s keels. There were eight whales, an average pod. Aware of their
      danger, they were going all abreast with great speed straight before
      the wind, rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in
      harness. They left a great, wide wake, as though continually unrolling
      a great wide parchment upon the sea.
      
      Full in this rapid wake, and many fathoms in the rear, swam a huge,
      humped old bull, which by his comparatively slow progress, as well as
      by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him, seemed
      afflicted with the jaundice, or some other infirmity. Whether this
      whale belonged to the pod in advance, seemed questionable; for it is
      not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social.
      Nevertheless, he stuck to their wake, though indeed their back water
      must have retarded him, because the white-bone or swell at his broad
      muzzle was a dashed one, like the swell formed when two hostile
      currents meet. His spout was short, slow, and laborious; coming forth
      with a choking sort of gush, and spending itself in torn shreds,
      followed by strange subterranean commotions in him, which seemed to
      have egress at his other buried extremity, causing the waters behind
      him to upbubble.
      
      “Who’s got some paregoric?” said Stubb, “he has the stomach-ache, I’m
      afraid. Lord, think of having half an acre of stomach-ache! Adverse
      winds are holding mad Christmas in him, boys. It’s the first foul wind
      I ever knew to blow from astern; but look, did ever whale yaw so
      before? it must be, he’s lost his tiller.”
      
      As an overladen Indiaman bearing down the Hindostan coast with a deck
      load of frightened horses, careens, buries, rolls, and wallows on her
      way; so did this old whale heave his aged bulk, and now and then partly
      turning over on his cumbrous rib-ends, expose the cause of his devious
      wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin. Whether he had lost
      that fin in battle, or had been born without it, it were hard to say.
      
      “Only wait a bit, old chap, and I’ll give ye a sling for that wounded
      arm,” cried cruel Flask, pointing to the whale-line near him.
      
      “Mind he don’t sling thee with it,” cried Starbuck. “Give way, or the
      German will have him.”
      
      With one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one
      fish, because not only was he the largest, and therefore the most
      valuable whale, but he was nearest to them, and the other whales were
      going with such great velocity, moreover, as almost to defy pursuit for
      the time. At this juncture the Pequod’s keels had shot by the three
      German boats last lowered; but from the great start he had had,
      Derick’s boat still led the chase, though every moment neared by his
      foreign rivals. The only thing they feared, was, that from being
      already so nigh to his mark, he would be enabled to dart his iron
      before they could completely overtake and pass him. As for Derick, he
      seemed quite confident that this would be the case, and occasionally
      with a deriding gesture shook his lamp-feeder at the other boats.
      
      “The ungracious and ungrateful dog!” cried Starbuck; “he mocks and
      dares me with the very poor-box I filled for him not five minutes
      ago!”—then in his old intense whisper—“Give way, greyhounds! Dog to
      it!”
      
      “I tell ye what it is, men”—cried Stubb to his crew—“it’s against my
      religion to get mad; but I’d like to eat that villainous
      Yarman—Pull—won’t ye? Are ye going to let that rascal beat ye? Do ye
      love brandy? A hogshead of brandy, then, to the best man. Come, why
      don’t some of ye burst a blood-vessel? Who’s that been dropping an
      anchor overboard—we don’t budge an inch—we’re becalmed. Halloo, here’s
      grass growing in the boat’s bottom—and by the Lord, the mast there’s
      budding. This won’t do, boys. Look at that Yarman! The short and long
      of it is, men, will ye spit fire or not?”
      
      “Oh! see the suds he makes!” cried Flask, dancing up and down—“What a
      hump—Oh, _do_ pile on the beef—lays like a log! Oh! my lads, _do_
      spring—slap-jacks and quahogs for supper, you know, my lads—baked clams
      and muffins—oh, _do_, _do_, spring,—he’s a hundred barreller—don’t lose
      him now—don’t oh, _don’t!_—see that Yarman—Oh, won’t ye pull for your
      duff, my lads—such a sog! such a sogger! Don’t ye love sperm? There
      goes three thousand dollars, men!—a bank!—a whole bank! The bank of
      England!—Oh, _do_, _do_, _do!_—What’s that Yarman about now?”
      
      At this moment Derick was in the act of pitching his lamp-feeder at the
      advancing boats, and also his oil-can; perhaps with the double view of
      retarding his rivals’ way, and at the same time economically
      accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss.
      
      “The unmannerly Dutch dogger!” cried Stubb. “Pull now, men, like fifty
      thousand line-of-battle-ship loads of red-haired devils. What d’ye say,
      Tashtego; are you the man to snap your spine in two-and-twenty pieces
      for the honor of old Gayhead? What d’ye say?”
      
      “I say, pull like god-dam,”—cried the Indian.
      
      Fiercely, but evenly incited by the taunts of the German, the Pequod’s
      three boats now began ranging almost abreast; and, so disposed,
      momentarily neared him. In that fine, loose, chivalrous attitude of the
      headsman when drawing near to his prey, the three mates stood up
      proudly, occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating
      cry of, “There she slides, now! Hurrah for the white-ash breeze! Down
      with the Yarman! Sail over him!”
      
      But so decided an original start had Derick had, that spite of all
      their gallantry, he would have proved the victor in this race, had not
      a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the
      blade of his midship oarsman. While this clumsy lubber was striving to
      free his white-ash, and while, in consequence, Derick’s boat was nigh
      to capsizing, and he thundering away at his men in a mighty rage;—that
      was a good time for Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask. With a shout, they took
      a mortal start forwards, and slantingly ranged up on the German’s
      quarter. An instant more, and all four boats were diagonically in the
      whale’s immediate wake, while stretching from them, on both sides, was
      the foaming swell that he made.
      
      It was a terrific, most pitiable, and maddening sight. The whale was
      now going head out, and sending his spout before him in a continual
      tormented jet; while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of
      fright. Now to this hand, now to that, he yawed in his faltering
      flight, and still at every billow that he broke, he spasmodically sank
      in the sea, or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin. So
      have I seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circles
      in the air, vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks. But the bird
      has a voice, and with plaintive cries will make known her fear; but the
      fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea, was chained up and enchanted
      in him; he had no voice, save that choking respiration through his
      spiracle, and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable; while
      still, in his amazing bulk, portcullis jaw, and omnipotent tail, there
      was enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied.
      
      Seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the Pequod’s
      boats the advantage, and rather than be thus foiled of his game, Derick
      chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long
      dart, ere the last chance would for ever escape.
      
      But no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke, than all
      three tigers—Queequeg, Tashtego, Daggoo—instinctively sprang to their
      feet, and standing in a diagonal row, simultaneously pointed their
      barbs; and darted over the head of the German harpooneer, their three
      Nantucket irons entered the whale. Blinding vapors of foam and
      white-fire! The three boats, in the first fury of the whale’s headlong
      rush, bumped the German’s aside with such force, that both Derick and
      his baffled harpooneer were spilled out, and sailed over by the three
      flying keels.
      
      “Don’t be afraid, my butter-boxes,” cried Stubb, casting a passing
      glance upon them as he shot by; “ye’ll be picked up presently—all
      right—I saw some sharks astern—St. Bernard’s dogs, you know—relieve
      distressed travellers. Hurrah! this is the way to sail now. Every keel
      a sunbeam! Hurrah!—Here we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a
      mad cougar! This puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a
      tilbury on a plain—makes the wheel-spokes fly, boys, when you fasten to
      him that way; and there’s danger of being pitched out too, when you
      strike a hill. Hurrah! this is the way a fellow feels when he’s going
      to Davy Jones—all a rush down an endless inclined plane! Hurrah! this
      whale carries the everlasting mail!”
      
      But the monster’s run was a brief one. Giving a sudden gasp, he
      tumultuously sounded. With a grating rush, the three lines flew round
      the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them;
      while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would
      soon exhaust the lines, that using all their dexterous might, they
      caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on; till at
      last—owing to the perpendicular strain from the lead-lined chocks of
      the boats, whence the three ropes went straight down into the blue—the
      gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water, while the three
      sterns tilted high in the air. And the whale soon ceasing to sound, for
      some time they remained in that attitude, fearful of expending more
      line, though the position was a little ticklish. But though boats have
      been taken down and lost in this way, yet it is this “holding on,” as
      it is called; this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from
      the back; this it is that often torments the Leviathan into soon rising
      again to meet the sharp lance of his foes. Yet not to speak of the
      peril of the thing, it is to be doubted whether this course is always
      the best; for it is but reasonable to presume, that the longer the
      stricken whale stays under water, the more he is exhausted. Because,
      owing to the enormous surface of him—in a full grown sperm whale
      something less than 2000 square feet—the pressure of the water is
      immense. We all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we
      ourselves stand up under; even here, above-ground, in the air; how
      vast, then, the burden of a whale, bearing on his back a column of two
      hundred fathoms of ocean! It must at least equal the weight of fifty
      atmospheres. One whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty
      line-of-battle ships, with all their guns, and stores, and men on
      board.
      
      As the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea, gazing down
      into its eternal blue noon; and as not a single groan or cry of any
      sort, nay, not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths;
      what landsman would have thought, that beneath all that silence and
      placidity, the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in
      agony! Not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows.
      Seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great Leviathan
      was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock. Suspended? and
      to what? To three bits of board. Is this the creature of whom it was
      once so triumphantly said—“Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons?
      or his head with fish-spears? The sword of him that layeth at him
      cannot hold, the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon: he esteemeth iron
      as straw; the arrow cannot make him flee; darts are counted as stubble;
      he laugheth at the shaking of a spear!” This the creature? this he? Oh!
      that unfulfilments should follow the prophets. For with the strength of
      a thousand thighs in his tail, Leviathan had run his head under the
      mountains of the sea, to hide him from the Pequod’s fish-spears!
      
      In that sloping afternoon sunlight, the shadows that the three boats
      sent down beneath the surface, must have been long enough and broad
      enough to shade half Xerxes’ army. Who can tell how appalling to the
      wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head!
      
      “Stand by, men; he stirs,” cried Starbuck, as the three lines suddenly
      vibrated in the water, distinctly conducting upwards to them, as by
      magnetic wires, the life and death throbs of the whale, so that every
      oarsman felt them in his seat. The next moment, relieved in great part
      from the downward strain at the bows, the boats gave a sudden bounce
      upwards, as a small icefield will, when a dense herd of white bears are
      scared from it into the sea.
      
      “Haul in! Haul in!” cried Starbuck again; “he’s rising.”
      
      The lines, of which, hardly an instant before, not one hand’s breadth
      could have been gained, were now in long quick coils flung back all
      dripping into the boats, and soon the whale broke water within two
      ship’s lengths of the hunters.
      
      His motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion. In most land
      animals there are certain valves or flood-gates in many of their veins,
      whereby when wounded, the blood is in some degree at least instantly
      shut off in certain directions. Not so with the whale; one of whose
      peculiarities it is to have an entire non-valvular structure of the
      blood-vessels, so that when pierced even by so small a point as a
      harpoon, a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial
      system; and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of
      water at a great distance below the surface, his life may be said to
      pour from him in incessant streams. Yet so vast is the quantity of
      blood in him, and so distant and numerous its interior fountains, that
      he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period; even
      as in a drought a river will flow, whose source is in the well-springs
      of far-off and undiscernible hills. Even now, when the boats pulled
      upon this whale, and perilously drew over his swaying flukes, and the
      lances were darted into him, they were followed by steady jets from the
      new made wound, which kept continually playing, while the natural
      spout-hole in his head was only at intervals, however rapid, sending
      its affrighted moisture into the air. From this last vent no blood yet
      came, because no vital part of him had thus far been struck. His life,
      as they significantly call it, was untouched.
      
      As the boats now more closely surrounded him, the whole upper part of
      his form, with much of it that is ordinarily submerged, was plainly
      revealed. His eyes, or rather the places where his eyes had been, were
      beheld. As strange misgrown masses gather in the knot-holes of the
      noblest oaks when prostrate, so from the points which the whale’s eyes
      had once occupied, now protruded blind bulbs, horribly pitiable to see.
      But pity there was none. For all his old age, and his one arm, and his
      blind eyes, he must die the death and be murdered, in order to light
      the gay bridals and other merry-makings of men, and also to illuminate
      the solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to
      all. Still rolling in his blood, at last he partially disclosed a
      strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance, the size of a bushel, low
      down on the flank.
      
      “A nice spot,” cried Flask; “just let me prick him there once.”
      
      “Avast!” cried Starbuck, “there’s no need of that!”
      
      But humane Starbuck was too late. At the instant of the dart an
      ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound, and goaded by it into more
      than sufferable anguish, the whale now spouting thick blood, with swift
      fury blindly darted at the craft, bespattering them and their glorying
      crews all over with showers of gore, capsizing Flask’s boat and marring
      the bows. It was his death stroke. For, by this time, so spent was he
      by loss of blood, that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had
      made; lay panting on his side, impotently flapped with his stumped fin,
      then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world; turned up the
      white secrets of his belly; lay like a log, and died. It was most
      piteous, that last expiring spout. As when by unseen hands the water is
      gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain, and with half-stifled
      melancholy gurglings the spray-column lowers and lowers to the
      ground—so the last long dying spout of the whale.
      
      Soon, while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship, the body
      showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled.
      Immediately, by Starbuck’s orders, lines were secured to it at
      different points, so that ere long every boat was a buoy; the sunken
      whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords. By very
      heedful management, when the ship drew nigh, the whale was transferred
      to her side, and was strongly secured there by the stiffest
      fluke-chains, for it was plain that unless artificially upheld, the
      body would at once sink to the bottom.
      
      It so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade,
      the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his
      flesh, on the lower part of the bunch before described. But as the
      stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured
      whales, with the flesh perfectly healed around them, and no prominence
      of any kind to denote their place; therefore, there must needs have
      been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for
      the ulceration alluded to. But still more curious was the fact of a
      lance-head of stone being found in him, not far from the buried iron,
      the flesh perfectly firm about it. Who had darted that stone lance? And
      when? It might have been darted by some Nor’ West Indian long before
      America was discovered.
      
      What other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous
      cabinet there is no telling. But a sudden stop was put to further
      discoveries, by the ship’s being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways
      to the sea, owing to the body’s immensely increasing tendency to sink.
      However, Starbuck, who had the ordering of affairs, hung on to it to
      the last; hung on to it so resolutely, indeed, that when at length the
      ship would have been capsized, if still persisting in locking arms with
      the body; then, when the command was given to break clear from it, such
      was the immovable strain upon the timber-heads to which the
      fluke-chains and cables were fastened, that it was impossible to cast
      them off. Meantime everything in the Pequod was aslant. To cross to the
      other side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a
      house. The ship groaned and gasped. Many of the ivory inlayings of her
      bulwarks and cabins were started from their places, by the unnatural
      dislocation. In vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the
      immovable fluke-chains, to pry them adrift from the timberheads; and so
      low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at
      all approached, while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed
      added to the sinking bulk, and the ship seemed on the point of going
      over.
      
      “Hold on, hold on, won’t ye?” cried Stubb to the body, “don’t be in
      such a devil of a hurry to sink! By thunder, men, we must do something
      or go for it. No use prying there; avast, I say with your handspikes,
      and run one of ye for a prayer book and a pen-knife, and cut the big
      chains.”
      
      “Knife? Aye, aye,” cried Queequeg, and seizing the carpenter’s heavy
      hatchet, he leaned out of a porthole, and steel to iron, began slashing
      at the largest fluke-chains. But a few strokes, full of sparks, were
      given, when the exceeding strain effected the rest. With a terrific
      snap, every fastening went adrift; the ship righted, the carcase sank.
      
      Now, this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed Sperm
      Whale is a very curious thing; nor has any fisherman yet adequately
      accounted for it. Usually the dead Sperm Whale floats with great
      buoyancy, with its side or belly considerably elevated above the
      surface. If the only whales that thus sank were old, meagre, and
      broken-hearted creatures, their pads of lard diminished and all their
      bones heavy and rheumatic; then you might with some reason assert that
      this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so
      sinking, consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him. But it
      is not so. For young whales, in the highest health, and swelling with
      noble aspirations, prematurely cut off in the warm flush and May of
      life, with all their panting lard about them; even these brawny,
      buoyant heroes do sometimes sink.
      
      Be it said, however, that the Sperm Whale is far less liable to this
      accident than any other species. Where one of that sort go down, twenty
      Right Whales do. This difference in the species is no doubt imputable
      in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the Right Whale;
      his Venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton; from this
      incumbrance the Sperm Whale is wholly free. But there are instances
      where, after the lapse of many hours or several days, the sunken whale
      again rises, more buoyant than in life. But the reason of this is
      obvious. Gases are generated in him; he swells to a prodigious
      magnitude; becomes a sort of animal balloon. A line-of-battle ship
      could hardly keep him under then. In the Shore Whaling, on soundings,
      among the Bays of New Zealand, when a Right Whale gives token of
      sinking, they fasten buoys to him, with plenty of rope; so that when
      the body has gone down, they know where to look for it when it shall
      have ascended again.
      
      It was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from
      the Pequod’s mast-heads, announcing that the Jungfrau was again
      lowering her boats; though the only spout in sight was that of a
      Fin-Back, belonging to the species of uncapturable whales, because of
      its incredible power of swimming. Nevertheless, the Fin-Back’s spout is
      so similar to the Sperm Whale’s, that by unskilful fishermen it is
      often mistaken for it. And consequently Derick and all his host were
      now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute. The Virgin crowding all
      sail, made after her four young keels, and thus they all disappeared
      far to leeward, still in bold, hopeful chase.
      
      Oh! many are the Fin-Backs, and many are the Dericks, my friend.
      
      
      CHAPTER 82. The Honor and Glory of Whaling.
      
      There are some enterprises in which a careful disorderliness is the
      true method.
      
      The more I dive into this matter of whaling, and push my researches up
      to the very spring-head of it so much the more am I impressed with its
      great honorableness and antiquity; and especially when I find so many
      great demi-gods and heroes, prophets of all sorts, who one way or other
      have shed distinction upon it, I am transported with the reflection
      that I myself belong, though but subordinately, to so emblazoned a
      fraternity.
      
      The gallant Perseus, a son of Jupiter, was the first whaleman; and to
      the eternal honor of our calling be it said, that the first whale
      attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent.
      Those were the knightly days of our profession, when we only bore arms
      to succor the distressed, and not to fill men’s lamp-feeders. Every one
      knows the fine story of Perseus and Andromeda; how the lovely
      Andromeda, the daughter of a king, was tied to a rock on the sea-coast,
      and as Leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off, Perseus, the
      prince of whalemen, intrepidly advancing, harpooned the monster, and
      delivered and married the maid. It was an admirable artistic exploit,
      rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day; inasmuch as
      this Leviathan was slain at the very first dart. And let no man doubt
      this Arkite story; for in the ancient Joppa, now Jaffa, on the Syrian
      coast, in one of the Pagan temples, there stood for many ages the vast
      skeleton of a whale, which the city’s legends and all the inhabitants
      asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that Perseus slew.
      When the Romans took Joppa, the same skeleton was carried to Italy in
      triumph. What seems most singular and suggestively important in this
      story, is this: it was from Joppa that Jonah set sail.
      
      Akin to the adventure of Perseus and Andromeda—indeed, by some supposed
      to be indirectly derived from it—is that famous story of St. George and
      the Dragon; which dragon I maintain to have been a whale; for in many
      old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together, and
      often stand for each other. “Thou art as a lion of the waters, and as a
      dragon of the sea,” saith Ezekiel; hereby, plainly meaning a whale; in
      truth, some versions of the Bible use that word itself. Besides, it
      would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had St. George but
      encountered a crawling reptile of the land, instead of doing battle
      with the great monster of the deep. Any man may kill a snake, but only
      a Perseus, a St. George, a Coffin, have the heart in them to march
      boldly up to a whale.
      
      Let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us; for though the
      creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely
      represented of a griffin-like shape, and though the battle is depicted
      on land and the saint on horseback, yet considering the great ignorance
      of those times, when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists;
      and considering that as in Perseus’ case, St. George’s whale might have
      crawled up out of the sea on the beach; and considering that the animal
      ridden by St. George might have been only a large seal, or sea-horse;
      bearing all this in mind, it will not appear altogether incompatible
      with the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene, to
      hold this so-called dragon no other than the great Leviathan himself.
      In fact, placed before the strict and piercing truth, this whole story
      will fare like that fish, flesh, and fowl idol of the Philistines,
      Dagon by name; who being planted before the ark of Israel, his horse’s
      head and both the palms of his hands fell off from him, and only the
      stump or fishy part of him remained. Thus, then, one of our own noble
      stamp, even a whaleman, is the tutelary guardian of England; and by
      good rights, we harpooneers of Nantucket should be enrolled in the most
      noble order of St. George. And therefore, let not the knights of that
      honorable company (none of whom, I venture to say, have ever had to do
      with a whale like their great patron), let them never eye a Nantucketer
      with disdain, since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we
      are much better entitled to St. George’s decoration than they.
      
      Whether to admit Hercules among us or not, concerning this I long
      remained dubious: for though according to the Greek mythologies, that
      antique Crockett and Kit Carson—that brawny doer of rejoicing good
      deeds, was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale; still, whether that
      strictly makes a whaleman of him, that might be mooted. It nowhere
      appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish, unless, indeed, from
      the inside. Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of involuntary
      whaleman; at any rate the whale caught him, if he did not the whale. I
      claim him for one of our clan.
      
      But, by the best contradictory authorities, this Grecian story of
      Hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more
      ancient Hebrew story of Jonah and the whale; and vice versâ; certainly
      they are very similar. If I claim the demi-god then, why not the
      prophet?
      
      Nor do heroes, saints, demigods, and prophets alone comprise the whole
      roll of our order. Our grand master is still to be named; for like
      royal kings of old times, we find the head waters of our fraternity in
      nothing short of the great gods themselves. That wondrous oriental
      story is now to be rehearsed from the Shaster, which gives us the dread
      Vishnoo, one of the three persons in the godhead of the Hindoos; gives
      us this divine Vishnoo himself for our Lord;—Vishnoo, who, by the first
      of his ten earthly incarnations, has for ever set apart and sanctified
      the whale. When Brahma, or the God of Gods, saith the Shaster, resolved
      to recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions, he gave
      birth to Vishnoo, to preside over the work; but the Vedas, or mystical
      books, whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to Vishnoo
      before beginning the creation, and which therefore must have contained
      something in the shape of practical hints to young architects, these
      Vedas were lying at the bottom of the waters; so Vishnoo became
      incarnate in a whale, and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths,
      rescued the sacred volumes. Was not this Vishnoo a whaleman, then? even
      as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman?
      
      Perseus, St. George, Hercules, Jonah, and Vishnoo! there’s a
      member-roll for you! What club but the whaleman’s can head off like
      that?
      
      
      CHAPTER 83. Jonah Historically Regarded.
      
      Reference was made to the historical story of Jonah and the whale in
      the preceding chapter. Now some Nantucketers rather distrust this
      historical story of Jonah and the whale. But then there were some
      sceptical Greeks and Romans, who, standing out from the orthodox pagans
      of their times, equally doubted the story of Hercules and the whale,
      and Arion and the dolphin; and yet their doubting those traditions did
      not make those traditions one whit the less facts, for all that.
      
      One old Sag-Harbor whaleman’s chief reason for questioning the Hebrew
      story was this:—He had one of those quaint old-fashioned Bibles,
      embellished with curious, unscientific plates; one of which represented
      Jonah’s whale with two spouts in his head—a peculiarity only true with
      respect to a species of the Leviathan (the Right Whale, and the
      varieties of that order), concerning which the fishermen have this
      saying, “A penny roll would choke him”; his swallow is so very small.
      But, to this, Bishop Jebb’s anticipative answer is ready. It is not
      necessary, hints the Bishop, that we consider Jonah as tombed in the
      whale’s belly, but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth. And
      this seems reasonable enough in the good Bishop. For truly, the Right
      Whale’s mouth would accommodate a couple of whist-tables, and
      comfortably seat all the players. Possibly, too, Jonah might have
      ensconced himself in a hollow tooth; but, on second thoughts, the Right
      Whale is toothless.
      
      Another reason which Sag-Harbor (he went by that name) urged for his
      want of faith in this matter of the prophet, was something obscurely in
      reference to his incarcerated body and the whale’s gastric juices. But
      this objection likewise falls to the ground, because a German exegetist
      supposes that Jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a
      _dead_ whale—even as the French soldiers in the Russian campaign turned
      their dead horses into tents, and crawled into them. Besides, it has
      been divined by other continental commentators, that when Jonah was
      thrown overboard from the Joppa ship, he straightway effected his
      escape to another vessel near by, some vessel with a whale for a
      figure-head; and, I would add, possibly called “The Whale,” as some
      craft are nowadays christened the “Shark,” the “Gull,” the “Eagle.” Nor
      have there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the
      whale mentioned in the book of Jonah merely meant a life-preserver—an
      inflated bag of wind—which the endangered prophet swam to, and so was
      saved from a watery doom. Poor Sag-Harbor, therefore, seems worsted all
      round. But he had still another reason for his want of faith. It was
      this, if I remember right: Jonah was swallowed by the whale in the
      Mediterranean Sea, and after three days he was vomited up somewhere
      within three days’ journey of Nineveh, a city on the Tigris, very much
      more than three days’ journey across from the nearest point of the
      Mediterranean coast. How is that?
      
      But was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within
      that short distance of Nineveh? Yes. He might have carried him round by
      the way of the Cape of Good Hope. But not to speak of the passage
      through the whole length of the Mediterranean, and another passage up
      the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, such a supposition would involve the
      complete circumnavigation of all Africa in three days, not to speak of
      the Tigris waters, near the site of Nineveh, being too shallow for any
      whale to swim in. Besides, this idea of Jonah’s weathering the Cape of
      Good Hope at so early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of
      that great headland from Bartholomew Diaz, its reputed discoverer, and
      so make modern history a liar.
      
      But all these foolish arguments of old Sag-Harbor only evinced his
      foolish pride of reason—a thing still more reprehensible in him, seeing
      that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the
      sun and the sea. I say it only shows his foolish, impious pride, and
      abominable, devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy. For by a
      Portuguese Catholic priest, this very idea of Jonah’s going to Nineveh
      via the Cape of Good Hope was advanced as a signal magnification of the
      general miracle. And so it was. Besides, to this day, the highly
      enlightened Turks devoutly believe in the historical story of Jonah.
      And some three centuries ago, an English traveller in old Harris’s
      Voyages, speaks of a Turkish Mosque built in honor of Jonah, in which
      Mosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil.
      
      
      CHAPTER 84. Pitchpoling.
      
      To make them run easily and swiftly, the axles of carriages are
      anointed; and for much the same purpose, some whalers perform an
      analogous operation upon their boat; they grease the bottom. Nor is it
      to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm, it may possibly
      be of no contemptible advantage; considering that oil and water are
      hostile; that oil is a sliding thing, and that the object in view is to
      make the boat slide bravely. Queequeg believed strongly in anointing
      his boat, and one morning not long after the German ship Jungfrau
      disappeared, took more than customary pains in that occupation;
      crawling under its bottom, where it hung over the side, and rubbing in
      the unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair
      from the craft’s bald keel. He seemed to be working in obedience to
      some particular presentiment. Nor did it remain unwarranted by the
      event.
      
      Towards noon whales were raised; but so soon as the ship sailed down to
      them, they turned and fled with swift precipitancy; a disordered
      flight, as of Cleopatra’s barges from Actium.
      
      Nevertheless, the boats pursued, and Stubb’s was foremost. By great
      exertion, Tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron; but the
      stricken whale, without at all sounding, still continued his horizontal
      flight, with added fleetness. Such unintermitted strainings upon the
      planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it. It became
      imperative to lance the flying whale, or be content to lose him. But to
      haul the boat up to his flank was impossible, he swam so fast and
      furious. What then remained?
      
      Of all the wondrous devices and dexterities, the sleights of hand and
      countless subtleties, to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced,
      none exceed that fine manœuvre with the lance called pitchpoling. Small
      sword, or broad sword, in all its exercises boasts nothing like it. It
      is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale; its grand fact
      and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is
      accurately darted from a violently rocking, jerking boat, under extreme
      headway. Steel and wood included, the entire spear is some ten or
      twelve feet in length; the staff is much slighter than that of the
      harpoon, and also of a lighter material—pine. It is furnished with a
      small rope called a warp, of considerable length, by which it can be
      hauled back to the hand after darting.
      
      But before going further, it is important to mention here, that though
      the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance, yet it is
      seldom done; and when done, is still less frequently successful, on
      account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as
      compared with the lance, which in effect become serious drawbacks. As a
      general thing, therefore, you must first get fast to a whale, before
      any pitchpoling comes into play.
      
      Look now at Stubb; a man who from his humorous, deliberate coolness and
      equanimity in the direst emergencies, was specially qualified to excel
      in pitchpoling. Look at him; he stands upright in the tossed bow of the
      flying boat; wrapt in fleecy foam, the towing whale is forty feet
      ahead. Handling the long lance lightly, glancing twice or thrice along
      its length to see if it be exactly straight, Stubb whistlingly gathers
      up the coil of the warp in one hand, so as to secure its free end in
      his grasp, leaving the rest unobstructed. Then holding the lance full
      before his waistband’s middle, he levels it at the whale; when,
      covering him with it, he steadily depresses the butt-end in his hand,
      thereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon
      his palm, fifteen feet in the air. He minds you somewhat of a juggler,
      balancing a long staff on his chin. Next moment with a rapid, nameless
      impulse, in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming
      distance, and quivers in the life spot of the whale. Instead of
      sparkling water, he now spouts red blood.
      
      “That drove the spigot out of him!” cried Stubb. “’Tis July’s immortal
      Fourth; all fountains must run wine today! Would now, it were old
      Orleans whiskey, or old Ohio, or unspeakable old Monongahela! Then,
      Tashtego, lad, I’d have ye hold a canakin to the jet, and we’d drink
      round it! Yea, verily, hearts alive, we’d brew choice punch in the
      spread of his spout-hole there, and from that live punch-bowl quaff the
      living stuff.”
      
      Again and again to such gamesome talk, the dexterous dart is repeated,
      the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful
      leash. The agonized whale goes into his flurry; the tow-line is
      slackened, and the pitchpoler dropping astern, folds his hands, and
      mutely watches the monster die.
      
      
      CHAPTER 85. The Fountain.
      
      That for six thousand years—and no one knows how many millions of ages
      before—the great whales should have been spouting all over the sea, and
      sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep, as with so many
      sprinkling or mistifying pots; and that for some centuries back,
      thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the
      whale, watching these sprinklings and spoutings—that all this should
      be, and yet, that down to this blessed minute (fifteen and a quarter
      minutes past one o’clock P.M. of this sixteenth day of December, A.D.
      1851), it should still remain a problem, whether these spoutings are,
      after all, really water, or nothing but vapor—this is surely a
      noteworthy thing.
      
      Let us, then, look at this matter, along with some interesting items
      contingent. Every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their
      gills, the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times
      is combined with the element in which they swim; hence, a herring or a
      cod might live a century, and never once raise its head above the
      surface. But owing to his marked internal structure which gives him
      regular lungs, like a human being’s, the whale can only live by
      inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere. Wherefore the
      necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world. But he cannot
      in any degree breathe through his mouth, for, in his ordinary attitude,
      the Sperm Whale’s mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the
      surface; and what is still more, his windpipe has no connexion with his
      mouth. No, he breathes through his spiracle alone; and this is on the
      top of his head.
      
      If I say, that in any creature breathing is only a function
      indispensable to vitality, inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a
      certain element, which being subsequently brought into contact with the
      blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle, I do not think I
      shall err; though I may possibly use some superfluous scientific words.
      Assume it, and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be
      aerated with one breath, he might then seal up his nostrils and not
      fetch another for a considerable time. That is to say, he would then
      live without breathing. Anomalous as it may seem, this is precisely the
      case with the whale, who systematically lives, by intervals, his full
      hour and more (when at the bottom) without drawing a single breath, or
      so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air; for, remember, he has
      no gills. How is this? Between his ribs and on each side of his spine
      he is supplied with a remarkable involved Cretan labyrinth of
      vermicelli-like vessels, which vessels, when he quits the surface, are
      completely distended with oxygenated blood. So that for an hour or
      more, a thousand fathoms in the sea, he carries a surplus stock of
      vitality in him, just as the camel crossing the waterless desert
      carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four
      supplementary stomachs. The anatomical fact of this labyrinth is
      indisputable; and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable
      and true, seems the more cogent to me, when I consider the otherwise
      inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in _having his spoutings out_,
      as the fishermen phrase it. This is what I mean. If unmolested, upon
      rising to the surface, the Sperm Whale will continue there for a period
      of time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings. Say he
      stays eleven minutes, and jets seventy times, that is, respires seventy
      breaths; then whenever he rises again, he will be sure to have his
      seventy breaths over again, to a minute. Now, if after he fetches a few
      breaths you alarm him, so that he sounds, he will be always dodging up
      again to make good his regular allowance of air. And not till those
      seventy breaths are told, will he finally go down to stay out his full
      term below. Remark, however, that in different individuals these rates
      are different; but in any one they are alike. Now, why should the whale
      thus insist upon having his spoutings out, unless it be to replenish
      his reservoir of air, ere descending for good? How obvious is it, too,
      that this necessity for the whale’s rising exposes him to all the fatal
      hazards of the chase. For not by hook or by net could this vast
      leviathan be caught, when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the
      sunlight. Not so much thy skill, then, O hunter, as the great
      necessities that strike the victory to thee!
      
      In man, breathing is incessantly going on—one breath only serving for
      two or three pulsations; so that whatever other business he has to
      attend to, waking or sleeping, breathe he must, or die he will. But the
      Sperm Whale only breathes about one seventh or Sunday of his time.
      
      It has been said that the whale only breathes through his spout-hole;
      if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water,
      then I opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of
      smell seems obliterated in him; for the only thing about him that at
      all answers to his nose is that identical spout-hole; and being so
      clogged with two elements, it could not be expected to have the power
      of smelling. But owing to the mystery of the spout—whether it be water
      or whether it be vapor—no absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at
      on this head. Sure it is, nevertheless, that the Sperm Whale has no
      proper olfactories. But what does he want of them? No roses, no
      violets, no Cologne-water in the sea.
      
      Furthermore, as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting
      canal, and as that long canal—like the grand Erie Canal—is furnished
      with a sort of locks (that open and shut) for the downward retention of
      air or the upward exclusion of water, therefore the whale has no voice;
      unless you insult him by saying, that when he so strangely rumbles, he
      talks through his nose. But then again, what has the whale to say?
      Seldom have I known any profound being that had anything to say to this
      world, unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a
      living. Oh! happy that the world is such an excellent listener!
      
      Now, the spouting canal of the Sperm Whale, chiefly intended as it is
      for the conveyance of air, and for several feet laid along,
      horizontally, just beneath the upper surface of his head, and a little
      to one side; this curious canal is very much like a gas-pipe laid down
      in a city on one side of a street. But the question returns whether
      this gas-pipe is also a water-pipe; in other words, whether the spout
      of the Sperm Whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath, or whether
      that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth, and
      discharged through the spiracle. It is certain that the mouth
      indirectly communicates with the spouting canal; but it cannot be
      proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the
      spiracle. Because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be,
      when in feeding he accidentally takes in water. But the Sperm Whale’s
      food is far beneath the surface, and there he cannot spout even if he
      would. Besides, if you regard him very closely, and time him with your
      watch, you will find that when unmolested, there is an undeviating
      rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of
      respiration.
      
      But why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject? Speak out!
      You have seen him spout; then declare what the spout is; can you not
      tell water from air? My dear sir, in this world it is not so easy to
      settle these plain things. I have ever found your plain things the
      knottiest of all. And as for this whale spout, you might almost stand
      in it, and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely.
      
      The central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping
      it; and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it,
      when, always, when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view
      of his spout, he is in a prodigious commotion, the water cascading all
      around him. And if at such times you should think that you really
      perceived drops of moisture in the spout, how do you know that they are
      not merely condensed from its vapor; or how do you know that they are
      not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spout-hole
      fissure, which is countersunk into the summit of the whale’s head? For
      even when tranquilly swimming through the mid-day sea in a calm, with
      his elevated hump sun-dried as a dromedary’s in the desert; even then,
      the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head, as under a
      blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with
      rain.
      
      Nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the
      precise nature of the whale spout. It will not do for him to be peering
      into it, and putting his face in it. You cannot go with your pitcher to
      this fountain and fill it, and bring it away. For even when coming into
      slight contact with the outer, vapory shreds of the jet, which will
      often happen, your skin will feverishly smart, from the acridness of
      the thing so touching it. And I know one, who coming into still closer
      contact with the spout, whether with some scientific object in view, or
      otherwise, I cannot say, the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm.
      Wherefore, among whalemen, the spout is deemed poisonous; they try to
      evade it. Another thing; I have heard it said, and I do not much doubt
      it, that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes, it will blind
      you. The wisest thing the investigator can do then, it seems to me, is
      to let this deadly spout alone.
      
      Still, we can hypothesize, even if we cannot prove and establish. My
      hypothesis is this: that the spout is nothing but mist. And besides
      other reasons, to this conclusion I am impelled, by considerations
      touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the Sperm Whale; I
      account him no common, shallow being, inasmuch as it is an undisputed
      fact that he is never found on soundings, or near shores; all other
      whales sometimes are. He is both ponderous and profound. And I am
      convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings, such as
      Plato, Pyrrho, the Devil, Jupiter, Dante, and so on, there always goes
      up a certain semi-visible steam, while in the act of thinking deep
      thoughts. While composing a little treatise on Eternity, I had the
      curiosity to place a mirror before me; and ere long saw reflected
      there, a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over
      my head. The invariable moisture of my hair, while plunged in deep
      thought, after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic, of an
      August noon; this seems an additional argument for the above
      supposition.
      
      And how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty, misty monster, to
      behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea; his vast, mild
      head overhung by a canopy of vapor, engendered by his incommunicable
      contemplations, and that vapor—as you will sometimes see it—glorified
      by a rainbow, as if Heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts.
      For, d’ye see, rainbows do not visit the clear air; they only irradiate
      vapor. And so, through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my
      mind, divine intuitions now and then shoot, enkindling my fog with a
      heavenly ray. And for this I thank God; for all have doubts; many deny;
      but doubts or denials, few along with them, have intuitions. Doubts of
      all things earthly, and intuitions of some things heavenly; this
      combination makes neither believer nor infidel, but makes a man who
      regards them both with equal eye.
      
      
      CHAPTER 86. The Tail.
      
      Other poets have warbled the praises of the soft eye of the antelope,
      and the lovely plumage of the bird that never alights; less celestial,
      I celebrate a tail.
      
      Reckoning the largest sized Sperm Whale’s tail to begin at that point
      of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man, it comprises
      upon its upper surface alone, an area of at least fifty square feet.
      The compact round body of its root expands into two broad, firm, flat
      palms or flukes, gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in
      thickness. At the crotch or junction, these flukes slightly overlap,
      then sideways recede from each other like wings, leaving a wide vacancy
      between. In no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely
      defined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes. At its utmost
      expansion in the full grown whale, the tail will considerably exceed
      twenty feet across.
      
      The entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews; but cut
      into it, and you find that three distinct strata compose it:—upper,
      middle, and lower. The fibres in the upper and lower layers, are long
      and horizontal; those of the middle one, very short, and running
      crosswise between the outside layers. This triune structure, as much as
      anything else, imparts power to the tail. To the student of old Roman
      walls, the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin
      course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful
      relics of the antique, and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the
      great strength of the masonry.
      
      But as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough,
      the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of
      muscular fibres and filaments, which passing on either side the loins
      and running down into the flukes, insensibly blend with them, and
      largely contribute to their might; so that in the tail the confluent
      measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point.
      Could annihilation occur to matter, this were the thing to do it.
      
      Nor does this—its amazing strength, at all tend to cripple the graceful
      flexion of its motions; where infantileness of ease undulates through a
      Titanism of power. On the contrary, those motions derive their most
      appalling beauty from it. Real strength never impairs beauty or
      harmony, but it often bestows it; and in everything imposingly
      beautiful, strength has much to do with the magic. Take away the tied
      tendons that all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved
      Hercules, and its charm would be gone. As devout Eckerman lifted the
      linen sheet from the naked corpse of Goethe, he was overwhelmed with
      the massive chest of the man, that seemed as a Roman triumphal arch.
      When Angelo paints even God the Father in human form, mark what
      robustness is there. And whatever they may reveal of the divine love in
      the Son, the soft, curled, hermaphroditical Italian pictures, in which
      his idea has been most successfully embodied; these pictures, so
      destitute as they are of all brawniness, hint nothing of any power, but
      the mere negative, feminine one of submission and endurance, which on
      all hands it is conceded, form the peculiar practical virtues of his
      teachings.
      
      Such is the subtle elasticity of the organ I treat of, that whether
      wielded in sport, or in earnest, or in anger, whatever be the mood it
      be in, its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace. Therein
      no fairy’s arm can transcend it.
      
      Five great motions are peculiar to it. First, when used as a fin for
      progression; Second, when used as a mace in battle; Third, in sweeping;
      Fourth, in lobtailing; Fifth, in peaking flukes.
      
      First: Being horizontal in its position, the Leviathan’s tail acts in a
      different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures. It never
      wriggles. In man or fish, wriggling is a sign of inferiority. To the
      whale, his tail is the sole means of propulsion. Scroll-wise coiled
      forwards beneath the body, and then rapidly sprung backwards, it is
      this which gives that singular darting, leaping motion to the monster
      when furiously swimming. His side-fins only serve to steer by.
      
      Second: It is a little significant, that while one sperm whale only
      fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw, nevertheless, in his
      conflicts with man, he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail. In
      striking at a boat, he swiftly curves away his flukes from it, and the
      blow is only inflicted by the recoil. If it be made in the unobstructed
      air, especially if it descend to its mark, the stroke is then simply
      irresistible. No ribs of man or boat can withstand it. Your only
      salvation lies in eluding it; but if it comes sideways through the
      opposing water, then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the
      whale-boat, and the elasticity of its materials, a cracked rib or a
      dashed plank or two, a sort of stitch in the side, is generally the
      most serious result. These submerged side blows are so often received
      in the fishery, that they are accounted mere child’s play. Some one
      strips off a frock, and the hole is stopped.
      
      Third: I cannot demonstrate it, but it seems to me, that in the whale
      the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail; for in this respect
      there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the
      elephant’s trunk. This delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of
      sweeping, when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft
      slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of
      the sea; and if he feel but a sailor’s whisker, woe to that sailor,
      whiskers and all. What tenderness there is in that preliminary touch!
      Had this tail any prehensile power, I should straightway bethink me of
      Darmonodes’ elephant that so frequented the flower-market, and with low
      salutations presented nosegays to damsels, and then caressed their
      zones. On more accounts than one, a pity it is that the whale does not
      possess this prehensile virtue in his tail; for I have heard of yet
      another elephant, that when wounded in the fight, curved round his
      trunk and extracted the dart.
      
      Fourth: Stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the
      middle of solitary seas, you find him unbent from the vast corpulence
      of his dignity, and kitten-like, he plays on the ocean as if it were a
      hearth. But still you see his power in his play. The broad palms of his
      tail are flirted high into the air; then smiting the surface, the
      thunderous concussion resounds for miles. You would almost think a
      great gun had been discharged; and if you noticed the light wreath of
      vapor from the spiracle at his other extremity, you would think that
      that was the smoke from the touch-hole.
      
      Fifth: As in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes
      lie considerably below the level of his back, they are then completely
      out of sight beneath the surface; but when he is about to plunge into
      the deeps, his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are
      tossed erect in the air, and so remain vibrating a moment, till they
      downwards shoot out of view. Excepting the sublime _breach_—somewhere
      else to be described—this peaking of the whale’s flukes is perhaps the
      grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature. Out of the bottomless
      profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the
      highest heaven. So in dreams, have I seen majestic Satan thrusting
      forth his tormented colossal claw from the flame Baltic of Hell. But in
      gazing at such scenes, it is all in all what mood you are in; if in the
      Dantean, the devils will occur to you; if in that of Isaiah, the
      archangels. Standing at the mast-head of my ship during a sunrise that
      crimsoned sky and sea, I once saw a large herd of whales in the east,
      all heading towards the sun, and for a moment vibrating in concert with
      peaked flukes. As it seemed to me at the time, such a grand embodiment
      of adoration of the gods was never beheld, even in Persia, the home of
      the fire worshippers. As Ptolemy Philopater testified of the African
      elephant, I then testified of the whale, pronouncing him the most
      devout of all beings. For according to King Juba, the military
      elephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks
      uplifted in the profoundest silence.
      
      The chance comparison in this chapter, between the whale and the
      elephant, so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk
      of the other are concerned, should not tend to place those two opposite
      organs on an equality, much less the creatures to which they
      respectively belong. For as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to
      Leviathan, so, compared with Leviathan’s tail, his trunk is but the
      stalk of a lily. The most direful blow from the elephant’s trunk were
      as the playful tap of a fan, compared with the measureless crush and
      crash of the sperm whale’s ponderous flukes, which in repeated
      instances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their
      oars and crews into the air, very much as an Indian juggler tosses his
      balls.*
      
      *Though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and
      the elephant is preposterous, inasmuch as in that particular the
      elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does
      to the elephant; nevertheless, there are not wanting some points of
      curious similitude; among these is the spout. It is well known that the
      elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk, and then
      elevating it, jet it forth in a stream.
      
      The more I consider this mighty tail, the more do I deplore my
      inability to express it. At times there are gestures in it, which,
      though they would well grace the hand of man, remain wholly
      inexplicable. In an extensive herd, so remarkable, occasionally, are
      these mystic gestures, that I have heard hunters who have declared them
      akin to Free-Mason signs and symbols; that the whale, indeed, by these
      methods intelligently conversed with the world. Nor are there wanting
      other motions of the whale in his general body, full of strangeness,
      and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant. Dissect him how I
      may, then, I but go skin deep; I know him not, and never will. But if I
      know not even the tail of this whale, how understand his head? much
      more, how comprehend his face, when face he has none? Thou shalt see my
      back parts, my tail, he seems to say, but my face shall not be seen.
      But I cannot completely make out his back parts; and hint what he will
      about his face, I say again he has no face.
      
      
      CHAPTER 87. The Grand Armada.
      
      The long and narrow peninsula of Malacca, extending south-eastward from
      the territories of Birmah, forms the most southerly point of all Asia.
      In a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of
      Sumatra, Java, Bally, and Timor; which, with many others, form a vast
      mole, or rampart, lengthwise connecting Asia with Australia, and
      dividing the long unbroken Indian ocean from the thickly studded
      oriental archipelagoes. This rampart is pierced by several sally-ports
      for the convenience of ships and whales; conspicuous among which are
      the straits of Sunda and Malacca. By the straits of Sunda, chiefly,
      vessels bound to China from the west, emerge into the China seas.
      
      Those narrow straits of Sunda divide Sumatra from Java; and standing
      midway in that vast rampart of islands, buttressed by that bold green
      promontory, known to seamen as Java Head; they not a little correspond
      to the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire: and
      considering the inexhaustible wealth of spices, and silks, and jewels,
      and gold, and ivory, with which the thousand islands of that oriental
      sea are enriched, it seems a significant provision of nature, that such
      treasures, by the very formation of the land, should at least bear the
      appearance, however ineffectual, of being guarded from the all-grasping
      western world. The shores of the Straits of Sunda are unsupplied with
      those domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the
      Mediterranean, the Baltic, and the Propontis. Unlike the Danes, these
      Orientals do not demand the obsequious homage of lowered top-sails from
      the endless procession of ships before the wind, which for centuries
      past, by night and by day, have passed between the islands of Sumatra
      and Java, freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east. But while
      they freely waive a ceremonial like this, they do by no means renounce
      their claim to more solid tribute.
      
      Time out of mind the piratical proas of the Malays, lurking among the
      low shaded coves and islets of Sumatra, have sallied out upon the
      vessels sailing through the straits, fiercely demanding tribute at the
      point of their spears. Though by the repeated bloody chastisements they
      have received at the hands of European cruisers, the audacity of these
      corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed; yet, even at the present
      day, we occasionally hear of English and American vessels, which, in
      those waters, have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged.
      
      With a fair, fresh wind, the Pequod was now drawing nigh to these
      straits; Ahab purposing to pass through them into the Javan sea, and
      thence, cruising northwards, over waters known to be frequented here
      and there by the Sperm Whale, sweep inshore by the Philippine Islands,
      and gain the far coast of Japan, in time for the great whaling season
      there. By these means, the circumnavigating Pequod would sweep almost
      all the known Sperm Whale cruising grounds of the world, previous to
      descending upon the Line in the Pacific; where Ahab, though everywhere
      else foiled in his pursuit, firmly counted upon giving battle to Moby
      Dick, in the sea he was most known to frequent; and at a season when he
      might most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it.
      
      But how now? in this zoned quest, does Ahab touch no land? does his
      crew drink air? Surely, he will stop for water. Nay. For a long time,
      now, the circus-running sun has raced within his fiery ring, and needs
      no sustenance but what’s in himself. So Ahab. Mark this, too, in the
      whaler. While other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff, to be
      transferred to foreign wharves; the world-wandering whale-ship carries
      no cargo but herself and crew, their weapons and their wants. She has a
      whole lake’s contents bottled in her ample hold. She is ballasted with
      utilities; not altogether with unusable pig-lead and kentledge. She
      carries years’ water in her. Clear old prime Nantucket water; which,
      when three years afloat, the Nantucketer, in the Pacific, prefers to
      drink before the brackish fluid, but yesterday rafted off in casks,
      from the Peruvian or Indian streams. Hence it is, that, while other
      ships may have gone to China from New York, and back again, touching at
      a score of ports, the whale-ship, in all that interval, may not have
      sighted one grain of soil; her crew having seen no man but floating
      seamen like themselves. So that did you carry them the news that
      another flood had come; they would only answer—“Well, boys, here’s the
      ark!”
      
      Now, as many Sperm Whales had been captured off the western coast of
      Java, in the near vicinity of the Straits of Sunda; indeed, as most of
      the ground, roundabout, was generally recognised by the fishermen as an
      excellent spot for cruising; therefore, as the Pequod gained more and
      more upon Java Head, the look-outs were repeatedly hailed, and
      admonished to keep wide awake. But though the green palmy cliffs of the
      land soon loomed on the starboard bow, and with delighted nostrils the
      fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air, yet not a single jet was
      descried. Almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game
      hereabouts, the ship had well nigh entered the straits, when the
      customary cheering cry was heard from aloft, and ere long a spectacle
      of singular magnificence saluted us.
      
      But here be it premised, that owing to the unwearied activity with
      which of late they have been hunted over all four oceans, the Sperm
      Whales, instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached
      companies, as in former times, are now frequently met with in extensive
      herds, sometimes embracing so great a multitude, that it would almost
      seem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and
      covenant for mutual assistance and protection. To this aggregation of
      the Sperm Whale into such immense caravans, may be imputed the
      circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds, you may now
      sometimes sail for weeks and months together, without being greeted by
      a single spout; and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems
      thousands on thousands.
      
      Broad on both bows, at the distance of some two or three miles, and
      forming a great semicircle, embracing one half of the level horizon, a
      continuous chain of whale-jets were up-playing and sparkling in the
      noon-day air. Unlike the straight perpendicular twin-jets of the Right
      Whale, which, dividing at top, fall over in two branches, like the
      cleft drooping boughs of a willow, the single forward-slanting spout of
      the Sperm Whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist, continually
      rising and falling away to leeward.
      
      Seen from the Pequod’s deck, then, as she would rise on a high hill of
      the sea, this host of vapory spouts, individually curling up into the
      air, and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze, showed
      like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis, descried
      of a balmy autumnal morning, by some horseman on a height.
      
      As marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains,
      accelerate their march, all eagerness to place that perilous passage in
      their rear, and once more expand in comparative security upon the
      plain; even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward
      through the straits; gradually contracting the wings of their
      semicircle, and swimming on, in one solid, but still crescentic centre.
      
      Crowding all sail the Pequod pressed after them; the harpooneers
      handling their weapons, and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet
      suspended boats. If the wind only held, little doubt had they, that
      chased through these Straits of Sunda, the vast host would only deploy
      into the Oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their
      number. And who could tell whether, in that congregated caravan, Moby
      Dick himself might not temporarily be swimming, like the worshipped
      white-elephant in the coronation procession of the Siamese! So with
      stun-sail piled on stun-sail, we sailed along, driving these leviathans
      before us; when, of a sudden, the voice of Tashtego was heard, loudly
      directing attention to something in our wake.
      
      Corresponding to the crescent in our van, we beheld another in our
      rear. It seemed formed of detached white vapors, rising and falling
      something like the spouts of the whales; only they did not so
      completely come and go; for they constantly hovered, without finally
      disappearing. Levelling his glass at this sight, Ahab quickly revolved
      in his pivot-hole, crying, “Aloft there, and rig whips and buckets to
      wet the sails;—Malays, sir, and after us!”
      
      As if too long lurking behind the headlands, till the Pequod should
      fairly have entered the straits, these rascally Asiatics were now in
      hot pursuit, to make up for their over-cautious delay. But when the
      swift Pequod, with a fresh leading wind, was herself in hot chase; how
      very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on
      to her own chosen pursuit,—mere riding-whips and rowels to her, that
      they were. As with glass under arm, Ahab to-and-fro paced the deck; in
      his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased, and in the after one
      the bloodthirsty pirates chasing _him_; some such fancy as the above
      seemed his. And when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery
      defile in which the ship was then sailing, and bethought him that
      through that gate lay the route to his vengeance, and beheld, how that
      through that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his
      deadly end; and not only that, but a herd of remorseless wild pirates
      and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with
      their curses;—when all these conceits had passed through his brain,
      Ahab’s brow was left gaunt and ribbed, like the black sand beach after
      some stormy tide has been gnawing it, without being able to drag the
      firm thing from its place.
      
      But thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew; and
      when, after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern, the
      Pequod at last shot by the vivid green Cockatoo Point on the Sumatra
      side, emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond; then, the
      harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been
      gaining upon the ship, than to rejoice that the ship had so
      victoriously gained upon the Malays. But still driving on in the wake
      of the whales, at length they seemed abating their speed; gradually the
      ship neared them; and the wind now dying away, word was passed to
      spring to the boats. But no sooner did the herd, by some presumed
      wonderful instinct of the Sperm Whale, become notified of the three
      keels that were after them,—though as yet a mile in their rear,—than
      they rallied again, and forming in close ranks and battalions, so that
      their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets, moved
      on with redoubled velocity.
      
      Stripped to our shirts and drawers, we sprang to the white-ash, and
      after several hours’ pulling were almost disposed to renounce the
      chase, when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating
      token that they were now at last under the influence of that strange
      perplexity of inert irresolution, which, when the fishermen perceive it
      in the whale, they say he is gallied. The compact martial columns in
      which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming, were now
      broken up in one measureless rout; and like King Porus’ elephants in
      the Indian battle with Alexander, they seemed going mad with
      consternation. In all directions expanding in vast irregular circles,
      and aimlessly swimming hither and thither, by their short thick
      spoutings, they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic. This was
      still more strangely evinced by those of their number, who, completely
      paralysed as it were, helplessly floated like water-logged dismantled
      ships on the sea. Had these Leviathans been but a flock of simple
      sheep, pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves, they could not
      possibly have evinced such excessive dismay. But this occasional
      timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures. Though
      banding together in tens of thousands, the lion-maned buffaloes of the
      West have fled before a solitary horseman. Witness, too, all human
      beings, how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatre’s pit,
      they will, at the slightest alarm of fire, rush helter-skelter for the
      outlets, crowding, trampling, jamming, and remorselessly dashing each
      other to death. Best, therefore, withhold any amazement at the
      strangely gallied whales before us, for there is no folly of the beasts
      of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men.
      
      Though many of the whales, as has been said, were in violent motion,
      yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor
      retreated, but collectively remained in one place. As is customary in
      those cases, the boats at once separated, each making for some one lone
      whale on the outskirts of the shoal. In about three minutes’ time,
      Queequeg’s harpoon was flung; the stricken fish darted blinding spray
      in our faces, and then running away with us like light, steered
      straight for the heart of the herd. Though such a movement on the part
      of the whale struck under such circumstances, is in no wise
      unprecedented; and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated;
      yet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the
      fishery. For as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the
      frantic shoal, you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a
      delirious throb.
      
      As, blind and deaf, the whale plunged forward, as if by sheer power of
      speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him; as we
      thus tore a white gash in the sea, on all sides menaced as we flew, by
      the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us; our beset boat was
      like a ship mobbed by ice-isles in a tempest, and striving to steer
      through their complicated channels and straits, knowing not at what
      moment it may be locked in and crushed.
      
      But not a bit daunted, Queequeg steered us manfully; now sheering off
      from this monster directly across our route in advance; now edging away
      from that, whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead, while all the
      time, Starbuck stood up in the bows, lance in hand, pricking out of our
      way whatever whales he could reach by short darts, for there was no
      time to make long ones. Nor were the oarsmen quite idle, though their
      wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with. They chiefly attended to
      the shouting part of the business. “Out of the way, Commodore!” cried
      one, to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface,
      and for an instant threatened to swamp us. “Hard down with your tail,
      there!” cried a second to another, which, close to our gunwale, seemed
      calmly cooling himself with his own fan-like extremity.
      
      All whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances, originally invented
      by the Nantucket Indians, called druggs. Two thick squares of wood of
      equal size are stoutly clenched together, so that they cross each
      other’s grain at right angles; a line of considerable length is then
      attached to the middle of this block, and the other end of the line
      being looped, it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon. It is
      chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used. For then, more
      whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time. But
      sperm whales are not every day encountered; while you may, then, you
      must kill all you can. And if you cannot kill them all at once, you
      must wing them, so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure.
      Hence it is, that at times like these the drugg, comes into
      requisition. Our boat was furnished with three of them. The first and
      second were successfully darted, and we saw the whales staggeringly
      running off, fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing
      drugg. They were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball. But
      upon flinging the third, in the act of tossing overboard the clumsy
      wooden block, it caught under one of the seats of the boat, and in an
      instant tore it out and carried it away, dropping the oarsman in the
      boat’s bottom as the seat slid from under him. On both sides the sea
      came in at the wounded planks, but we stuffed two or three drawers and
      shirts in, and so stopped the leaks for the time.
      
      It had been next to impossible to dart these drugged-harpoons, were it
      not that as we advanced into the herd, our whale’s way greatly
      diminished; moreover, that as we went still further and further from
      the circumference of commotion, the direful disorders seemed waning. So
      that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out, and the towing whale
      sideways vanished; then, with the tapering force of his parting
      momentum, we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the
      shoal, as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene
      valley lake. Here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost
      whales, were heard but not felt. In this central expanse the sea
      presented that smooth satin-like surface, called a sleek, produced by
      the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods.
      Yes, we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the
      heart of every commotion. And still in the distracted distance we
      beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles, and saw successive
      pods of whales, eight or ten in each, swiftly going round and round,
      like multiplied spans of horses in a ring; and so closely shoulder to
      shoulder, that a Titanic circus-rider might easily have over-arched the
      middle ones, and so have gone round on their backs. Owing to the
      density of the crowd of reposing whales, more immediately surrounding
      the embayed axis of the herd, no possible chance of escape was at
      present afforded us. We must watch for a breach in the living wall that
      hemmed us in; the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us
      up. Keeping at the centre of the lake, we were occasionally visited by
      small tame cows and calves; the women and children of this routed host.
      
      Now, inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving
      outer circles, and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in
      any one of those circles, the entire area at this juncture, embraced by
      the whole multitude, must have contained at least two or three square
      miles. At any rate—though indeed such a test at such a time might be
      deceptive—spoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed
      playing up almost from the rim of the horizon. I mention this
      circumstance, because, as if the cows and calves had been purposely
      locked up in this innermost fold; and as if the wide extent of the herd
      had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its
      stopping; or, possibly, being so young, unsophisticated, and every way
      innocent and inexperienced; however it may have been, these smaller
      whales—now and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the
      lake—evinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence, or else a still
      becharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at. Like
      household dogs they came snuffling round us, right up to our gunwales,
      and touching them; till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly
      domesticated them. Queequeg patted their foreheads; Starbuck scratched
      their backs with his lance; but fearful of the consequences, for the
      time refrained from darting it.
      
      But far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface, another and still
      stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side. For, suspended
      in those watery vaults, floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the
      whales, and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become
      mothers. The lake, as I have hinted, was to a considerable depth
      exceedingly transparent; and as human infants while suckling will
      calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast, as if leading two
      different lives at the time; and while yet drawing mortal nourishment,
      be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscence;—even so
      did the young of these whales seem looking up towards us, but not at
      us, as if we were but a bit of Gulfweed in their new-born sight.
      Floating on their sides, the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us. One
      of these little infants, that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a
      day old, might have measured some fourteen feet in length, and some six
      feet in girth. He was a little frisky; though as yet his body seemed
      scarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately
      occupied in the maternal reticule; where, tail to head, and all ready
      for the final spring, the unborn whale lies bent like a Tartar’s bow.
      The delicate side-fins, and the palms of his flukes, still freshly
      retained the plaited crumpled appearance of a baby’s ears newly arrived
      from foreign parts.
      
      “Line! line!” cried Queequeg, looking over the gunwale; “him fast! him
      fast!—Who line him! Who struck?—Two whale; one big, one little!”
      
      “What ails ye, man?” cried Starbuck.
      
      “Look-e here,” said Queequeg, pointing down.
      
      As when the stricken whale, that from the tub has reeled out hundreds
      of fathoms of rope; as, after deep sounding, he floats up again, and
      shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling
      towards the air; so now, Starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord
      of Madame Leviathan, by which the young cub seemed still tethered to
      its dam. Not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase, this
      natural line, with the maternal end loose, becomes entangled with the
      hempen one, so that the cub is thereby trapped. Some of the subtlest
      secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond. We
      saw young Leviathan amours in the deep.*
      
      *The sperm whale, as with all other species of the Leviathan, but
      unlike most other fish, breeds indifferently at all seasons; after a
      gestation which may probably be set down at nine months, producing but
      one at a time; though in some few known instances giving birth to an
      Esau and Jacob:—a contingency provided for in suckling by two teats,
      curiously situated, one on each side of the anus; but the breasts
      themselves extend upwards from that. When by chance these precious
      parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunter’s lance, the mother’s
      pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods. The milk
      is very sweet and rich; it has been tasted by man; it might do well
      with strawberries. When overflowing with mutual esteem, the whales
      salute _more hominum_.
      
      And thus, though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and
      affrights, did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and
      fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments; yea, serenely revelled
      in dalliance and delight. But even so, amid the tornadoed Atlantic of
      my being, do I myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm;
      and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me, deep down
      and deep inland there I still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy.
      
      Meanwhile, as we thus lay entranced, the occasional sudden frantic
      spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats,
      still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host; or
      possibly carrying on the war within the first circle, where abundance
      of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them. But the sight
      of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro
      across the circles, was nothing to what at last met our eyes. It is
      sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful
      and alert, to seek to hamstring him, as it were, by sundering or
      maiming his gigantic tail-tendon. It is done by darting a short-handled
      cutting-spade, to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again. A
      whale wounded (as we afterwards learned) in this part, but not
      effectually, as it seemed, had broken away from the boat, carrying
      along with him half of the harpoon line; and in the extraordinary agony
      of the wound, he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the
      lone mounted desperado Arnold, at the battle of Saratoga, carrying
      dismay wherever he went.
      
      But agonizing as was the wound of this whale, and an appalling
      spectacle enough, any way; yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed
      to inspire the rest of the herd, was owing to a cause which at first
      the intervening distance obscured from us. But at length we perceived
      that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery, this whale
      had become entangled in the harpoon-line that he towed; he had also run
      away with the cutting-spade in him; and while the free end of the rope
      attached to that weapon, had permanently caught in the coils of the
      harpoon-line round his tail, the cutting-spade itself had worked loose
      from his flesh. So that tormented to madness, he was now churning
      through the water, violently flailing with his flexible tail, and
      tossing the keen spade about him, wounding and murdering his own
      comrades.
      
      This terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their
      stationary fright. First, the whales forming the margin of our lake
      began to crowd a little, and tumble against each other, as if lifted by
      half spent billows from afar; then the lake itself began faintly to
      heave and swell; the submarine bridal-chambers and nurseries vanished;
      in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central
      circles began to swim in thickening clusters. Yes, the long calm was
      departing. A low advancing hum was soon heard; and then like to the
      tumultuous masses of block-ice when the great river Hudson breaks up in
      Spring, the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner
      centre, as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain. Instantly
      Starbuck and Queequeg changed places; Starbuck taking the stern.
      
      “Oars! Oars!” he intensely whispered, seizing the helm—“gripe your
      oars, and clutch your souls, now! My God, men, stand by! Shove him off,
      you Queequeg—the whale there!—prick him!—hit him! Stand up—stand up,
      and stay so! Spring, men—pull, men; never mind their backs—scrape
      them!—scrape away!”
      
      The boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks, leaving a
      narrow Dardanelles between their long lengths. But by desperate
      endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening; then giving way
      rapidly, and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet.
      After many similar hair-breadth escapes, we at last swiftly glided into
      what had just been one of the outer circles, but now crossed by random
      whales, all violently making for one centre. This lucky salvation was
      cheaply purchased by the loss of Queequeg’s hat, who, while standing in
      the bows to prick the fugitive whales, had his hat taken clean from his
      head by the air-eddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad
      flukes close by.
      
      Riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was, it soon
      resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement; for having
      clumped together at last in one dense body, they then renewed their
      onward flight with augmented fleetness. Further pursuit was useless;
      but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged
      whales might be dropped astern, and likewise to secure one which Flask
      had killed and waifed. The waif is a pennoned pole, two or three of
      which are carried by every boat; and which, when additional game is at
      hand, are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale, both
      to mark its place on the sea, and also as token of prior possession,
      should the boats of any other ship draw near.
      
      The result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious
      saying in the Fishery,—the more whales the less fish. Of all the
      drugged whales only one was captured. The rest contrived to escape for
      the time, but only to be taken, as will hereafter be seen, by some
      other craft than the Pequod.
      
      
      CHAPTER 88. Schools and Schoolmasters.
      
      The previous chapter gave account of an immense body or herd of Sperm
      Whales, and there was also then given the probable cause inducing those
      vast aggregations.
      
      Now, though such great bodies are at times encountered, yet, as must
      have been seen, even at the present day, small detached bands are
      occasionally observed, embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each.
      Such bands are known as schools. They generally are of two sorts; those
      composed almost entirely of females, and those mustering none but young
      vigorous males, or bulls, as they are familiarly designated.
      
      In cavalier attendance upon the school of females, you invariably see a
      male of full grown magnitude, but not old; who, upon any alarm, evinces
      his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his
      ladies. In truth, this gentleman is a luxurious Ottoman, swimming about
      over the watery world, surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and
      endearments of the harem. The contrast between this Ottoman and his
      concubines is striking; because, while he is always of the largest
      leviathanic proportions, the ladies, even at full growth, are not more
      than one-third of the bulk of an average-sized male. They are
      comparatively delicate, indeed; I dare say, not to exceed half a dozen
      yards round the waist. Nevertheless, it cannot be denied, that upon the
      whole they are hereditarily entitled to _en bon point_.
      
      It is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent
      ramblings. Like fashionables, they are for ever on the move in
      leisurely search of variety. You meet them on the Line in time for the
      full flower of the Equatorial feeding season, having just returned,
      perhaps, from spending the summer in the Northern seas, and so cheating
      summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth. By the time they have
      lounged up and down the promenade of the Equator awhile, they start for
      the Oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there, and so
      evade the other excessive temperature of the year.
      
      When serenely advancing on one of these journeys, if any strange
      suspicious sights are seen, my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his
      interesting family. Should any unwarrantably pert young Leviathan
      coming that way, presume to draw confidentially close to one of the
      ladies, with what prodigious fury the Bashaw assails him, and chases
      him away! High times, indeed, if unprincipled young rakes like him are
      to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss; though do
      what the Bashaw will, he cannot keep the most notorious Lothario out of
      his bed; for, alas! all fish bed in common. As ashore, the ladies often
      cause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers; just so with
      the whales, who sometimes come to deadly battle, and all for love. They
      fence with their long lower jaws, sometimes locking them together, and
      so striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their
      antlers. Not a few are captured having the deep scars of these
      encounters,—furrowed heads, broken teeth, scolloped fins; and in some
      instances, wrenched and dislocated mouths.
      
      But supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at
      the first rush of the harem’s lord, then is it very diverting to watch
      that lord. Gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and
      revels there awhile, still in tantalizing vicinity to young Lothario,
      like pious Solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines.
      Granting other whales to be in sight, the fishermen will seldom give
      chase to one of these Grand Turks; for these Grand Turks are too lavish
      of their strength, and hence their unctuousness is small. As for the
      sons and the daughters they beget, why, those sons and daughters must
      take care of themselves; at least, with only the maternal help. For
      like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named, my
      Lord Whale has no taste for the nursery, however much for the bower;
      and so, being a great traveller, he leaves his anonymous babies all
      over the world; every baby an exotic. In good time, nevertheless, as
      the ardour of youth declines; as years and dumps increase; as
      reflection lends her solemn pauses; in short, as a general lassitude
      overtakes the sated Turk; then a love of ease and virtue supplants the
      love for maidens; our Ottoman enters upon the impotent, repentant,
      admonitory stage of life, forswears, disbands the harem, and grown to
      an exemplary, sulky old soul, goes about all alone among the meridians
      and parallels saying his prayers, and warning each young Leviathan from
      his amorous errors.
      
      Now, as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school, so is
      the lord and master of that school technically known as the
      schoolmaster. It is therefore not in strict character, however
      admirably satirical, that after going to school himself, he should then
      go abroad inculcating not what he learned there, but the folly of it.
      His title, schoolmaster, would very naturally seem derived from the
      name bestowed upon the harem itself, but some have surmised that the
      man who first thus entitled this sort of Ottoman whale, must have read
      the memoirs of Vidocq, and informed himself what sort of a
      country-schoolmaster that famous Frenchman was in his younger days, and
      what was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into some of
      his pupils.
      
      The same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale
      betakes himself in his advancing years, is true of all aged Sperm
      Whales. Almost universally, a lone whale—as a solitary Leviathan is
      called—proves an ancient one. Like venerable moss-bearded Daniel Boone,
      he will have no one near him but Nature herself; and her he takes to
      wife in the wilderness of waters, and the best of wives she is, though
      she keeps so many moody secrets.
      
      The schools composing none but young and vigorous males, previously
      mentioned, offer a strong contrast to the harem schools. For while
      those female whales are characteristically timid, the young males, or
      forty-barrel-bulls, as they call them, are by far the most pugnacious
      of all Leviathans, and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter;
      excepting those wondrous grey-headed, grizzled whales, sometimes met,
      and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout.
      
      The Forty-barrel-bull schools are larger than the harem schools. Like a
      mob of young collegians, they are full of fight, fun, and wickedness,
      tumbling round the world at such a reckless, rollicking rate, that no
      prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous
      lad at Yale or Harvard. They soon relinquish this turbulence though,
      and when about three-fourths grown, break up, and separately go about
      in quest of settlements, that is, harems.
      
      Another point of difference between the male and female schools is
      still more characteristic of the sexes. Say you strike a
      Forty-barrel-bull—poor devil! all his comrades quit him. But strike a
      member of the harem school, and her companions swim around her with
      every token of concern, sometimes lingering so near her and so long, as
      themselves to fall a prey.
      
      
      CHAPTER 89. Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish.
      
      The allusion to the waif and waif-poles in the last chapter but one,
      necessitates some account of the laws and regulations of the whale
      fishery, of which the waif may be deemed the grand symbol and badge.
      
      It frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company,
      a whale may be struck by one vessel, then escape, and be finally killed
      and captured by another vessel; and herein are indirectly comprised
      many minor contingencies, all partaking of this one grand feature. For
      example,—after a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale, the
      body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm; and
      drifting far away to leeward, be retaken by a second whaler, who, in a
      calm, snugly tows it alongside, without risk of life or line. Thus the
      most vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between the
      fishermen, were there not some written or unwritten, universal,
      undisputed law applicable to all cases.
      
      Perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative
      enactment, was that of Holland. It was decreed by the States-General in
      A.D. 1695. But though no other nation has ever had any written whaling
      law, yet the American fishermen have been their own legislators and
      lawyers in this matter. They have provided a system which for terse
      comprehensiveness surpasses Justinian’s Pandects and the By-laws of the
      Chinese Society for the Suppression of Meddling with other People’s
      Business. Yes; these laws might be engraven on a Queen Anne’s farthing,
      or the barb of a harpoon, and worn round the neck, so small are they.
      
      I. A Fast-Fish belongs to the party fast to it.
      
      II. A Loose-Fish is fair game for anybody who can soonest catch it.
      
      But what plays the mischief with this masterly code is the admirable
      brevity of it, which necessitates a vast volume of commentaries to
      expound it.
      
      First: What is a Fast-Fish? Alive or dead a fish is technically fast,
      when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat, by any medium at
      all controllable by the occupant or occupants,—a mast, an oar, a
      nine-inch cable, a telegraph wire, or a strand of cobweb, it is all the
      same. Likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif, or any
      other recognised symbol of possession; so long as the party waifing it
      plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside, as well
      as their intention so to do.
      
      These are scientific commentaries; but the commentaries of the whalemen
      themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocks—the
      Coke-upon-Littleton of the fist. True, among the more upright and
      honorable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases, where
      it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim
      possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party. But
      others are by no means so scrupulous.
      
      Some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whale-trover litigated
      in England, wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of
      a whale in the Northern seas; and when indeed they (the plaintiffs) had
      succeeded in harpooning the fish; they were at last, through peril of
      their lives, obliged to forsake not only their lines, but their boat
      itself. Ultimately the defendants (the crew of another ship) came up
      with the whale, struck, killed, seized, and finally appropriated it
      before the very eyes of the plaintiffs. And when those defendants were
      remonstrated with, their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs’
      teeth, and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had
      done, he would now retain their line, harpoons, and boat, which had
      remained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure. Wherefore
      the plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale,
      line, harpoons, and boat.
      
      Mr. Erskine was counsel for the defendants; Lord Ellenborough was the
      judge. In the course of the defence, the witty Erskine went on to
      illustrate his position, by alluding to a recent crim. con. case,
      wherein a gentleman, after in vain trying to bridle his wife’s
      viciousness, had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life; but in
      the course of years, repenting of that step, he instituted an action to
      recover possession of her. Erskine was on the other side; and he then
      supported it by saying, that though the gentleman had originally
      harpooned the lady, and had once had her fast, and only by reason of
      the great stress of her plunging viciousness, had at last abandoned
      her; yet abandon her he did, so that she became a loose-fish; and
      therefore when a subsequent gentleman re-harpooned her, the lady then
      became that subsequent gentleman’s property, along with whatever
      harpoon might have been found sticking in her.
      
      Now in the present case Erskine contended that the examples of the
      whale and the lady were reciprocally illustrative of each other.
      
      These pleadings, and the counter pleadings, being duly heard, the very
      learned judge in set terms decided, to wit,—That as for the boat, he
      awarded it to the plaintiffs, because they had merely abandoned it to
      save their lives; but that with regard to the controverted whale,
      harpoons, and line, they belonged to the defendants; the whale, because
      it was a Loose-Fish at the time of the final capture; and the harpoons
      and line because when the fish made off with them, it (the fish)
      acquired a property in those articles; and hence anybody who afterwards
      took the fish had a right to them. Now the defendants afterwards took
      the fish; ergo, the aforesaid articles were theirs.
      
      A common man looking at this decision of the very learned Judge, might
      possibly object to it. But ploughed up to the primary rock of the
      matter, the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws
      previously quoted, and applied and elucidated by Lord Ellenborough in
      the above cited case; these two laws touching Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish,
      I say, will, on reflection, be found the fundamentals of all human
      jurisprudence; for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of
      sculpture, the Temple of the Law, like the Temple of the Philistines,
      has but two props to stand on.
      
      Is it not a saying in every one’s mouth, Possession is half of the law:
      that is, regardless of how the thing came into possession? But often
      possession is the whole of the law. What are the sinews and souls of
      Russian serfs and Republican slaves but Fast-Fish, whereof possession
      is the whole of the law? What to the rapacious landlord is the widow’s
      last mite but a Fast-Fish? What is yonder undetected villain’s marble
      mansion with a door-plate for a waif; what is that but a Fast-Fish?
      What is the ruinous discount which Mordecai, the broker, gets from poor
      Woebegone, the bankrupt, on a loan to keep Woebegone’s family from
      starvation; what is that ruinous discount but a Fast-Fish? What is the
      Archbishop of Savesoul’s income of £100,000 seized from the scant bread
      and cheese of hundreds of thousands of broken-backed laborers (all sure
      of heaven without any of Savesoul’s help) what is that globular
      £100,000 but a Fast-Fish? What are the Duke of Dunder’s hereditary
      towns and hamlets but Fast-Fish? What to that redoubted harpooneer,
      John Bull, is poor Ireland, but a Fast-Fish? What to that apostolic
      lancer, Brother Jonathan, is Texas but a Fast-Fish? And concerning all
      these, is not Possession the whole of the law?
      
      But if the doctrine of Fast-Fish be pretty generally applicable, the
      kindred doctrine of Loose-Fish is still more widely so. That is
      internationally and universally applicable.
      
      What was America in 1492 but a Loose-Fish, in which Columbus struck the
      Spanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and
      mistress? What was Poland to the Czar? What Greece to the Turk? What
      India to England? What at last will Mexico be to the United States? All
      Loose-Fish.
      
      What are the Rights of Man and the Liberties of the World but
      Loose-Fish? What all men’s minds and opinions but Loose-Fish? What is
      the principle of religious belief in them but a Loose-Fish? What to the
      ostentatious smuggling verbalists are the thoughts of thinkers but
      Loose-Fish? What is the great globe itself but a Loose-Fish? And what
      are you, reader, but a Loose-Fish and a Fast-Fish, too?
      
      
      CHAPTER 90. Heads or Tails.
      
      “De balena vero sufficit, si rex habeat caput, et regina caudam.”
      _Bracton, l. 3, c. 3._
      
      Latin from the books of the Laws of England, which taken along with the
      context, means, that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of
      that land, the King, as Honorary Grand Harpooneer, must have the head,
      and the Queen be respectfully presented with the tail. A division
      which, in the whale, is much like halving an apple; there is no
      intermediate remainder. Now as this law, under a modified form, is to
      this day in force in England; and as it offers in various respects a
      strange anomaly touching the general law of Fast and Loose-Fish, it is
      here treated of in a separate chapter, on the same courteous principle
      that prompts the English railways to be at the expense of a separate
      car, specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty. In the first
      place, in curious proof of the fact that the above-mentioned law is
      still in force, I proceed to lay before you a circumstance that
      happened within the last two years.
      
      It seems that some honest mariners of Dover, or Sandwich, or some one
      of the Cinque Ports, had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and
      beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from
      the shore. Now the Cinque Ports are partially or somehow under the
      jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle, called a Lord Warden.
      Holding the office directly from the crown, I believe, all the royal
      emoluments incident to the Cinque Port territories become by assignment
      his. By some writers this office is called a sinecure. But not so.
      Because the Lord Warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his
      perquisites; which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of
      them.
      
      Now when these poor sun-burnt mariners, bare-footed, and with their
      trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs, had wearily hauled their
      fat fish high and dry, promising themselves a good £150 from the
      precious oil and bone; and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their
      wives, and good ale with their cronies, upon the strength of their
      respective shares; up steps a very learned and most Christian and
      charitable gentleman, with a copy of Blackstone under his arm; and
      laying it upon the whale’s head, he says—“Hands off! this fish, my
      masters, is a Fast-Fish. I seize it as the Lord Warden’s.” Upon this
      the poor mariners in their respectful consternation—so truly
      English—knowing not what to say, fall to vigorously scratching their
      heads all round; meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the
      stranger. But that did in nowise mend the matter, or at all soften the
      hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of Blackstone. At
      length one of them, after long scratching about for his ideas, made
      bold to speak,
      
      “Please, sir, who is the Lord Warden?”
      
      “The Duke.”
      
      “But the duke had nothing to do with taking this fish?”
      
      “It is his.”
      
      “We have been at great trouble, and peril, and some expense, and is all
      that to go to the Duke’s benefit; we getting nothing at all for our
      pains but our blisters?”
      
      “It is his.”
      
      “Is the Duke so very poor as to be forced to this desperate mode of
      getting a livelihood?”
      
      “It is his.”
      
      “I thought to relieve my old bed-ridden mother by part of my share of
      this whale.”
      
      “It is his.”
      
      “Won’t the Duke be content with a quarter or a half?”
      
      “It is his.”
      
      In a word, the whale was seized and sold, and his Grace the Duke of
      Wellington received the money. Thinking that viewed in some particular
      lights, the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be
      deemed, under the circumstances, a rather hard one, an honest clergyman
      of the town respectfully addressed a note to his Grace, begging him to
      take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration. To
      which my Lord Duke in substance replied (both letters were published)
      that he had already done so, and received the money, and would be
      obliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he (the reverend
      gentleman) would decline meddling with other people’s business. Is this
      the still militant old man, standing at the corners of the three
      kingdoms, on all hands coercing alms of beggars?
      
      It will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the Duke
      to the whale was a delegated one from the Sovereign. We must needs
      inquire then on what principle the Sovereign is originally invested
      with that right. The law itself has already been set forth. But Plowdon
      gives us the reason for it. Says Plowdon, the whale so caught belongs
      to the King and Queen, “because of its superior excellence.” And by the
      soundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such
      matters.
      
      But why should the King have the head, and the Queen the tail? A reason
      for that, ye lawyers!
      
      In his treatise on “Queen-Gold,” or Queen-pinmoney, an old King’s Bench
      author, one William Prynne, thus discourseth: “Ye tail is ye Queen’s,
      that ye Queen’s wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone.” Now this
      was written at a time when the black limber bone of the Greenland or
      Right whale was largely used in ladies’ bodices. But this same bone is
      not in the tail; it is in the head, which is a sad mistake for a
      sagacious lawyer like Prynne. But is the Queen a mermaid, to be
      presented with a tail? An allegorical meaning may lurk here.
      
      There are two royal fish so styled by the English law writers—the whale
      and the sturgeon; both royal property under certain limitations, and
      nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crown’s ordinary revenue. I
      know not that any other author has hinted of the matter; but by
      inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same
      way as the whale, the King receiving the highly dense and elastic head
      peculiar to that fish, which, symbolically regarded, may possibly be
      humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality. And thus there
      seems a reason in all things, even in law.
      
      
      CHAPTER 91. The Pequod Meets The Rose-Bud.
      
      “In vain it was to rake for Ambergriese in the paunch of this
      Leviathan, insufferable fetor denying not inquiry.” _Sir T. Browne,
      V.E._
      
      It was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted, and when
      we were slowly sailing over a sleepy, vapory, mid-day sea, that the
      many noses on the Pequod’s deck proved more vigilant discoverers than
      the three pairs of eyes aloft. A peculiar and not very pleasant smell
      was smelt in the sea.
      
      “I will bet something now,” said Stubb, “that somewhere hereabouts are
      some of those drugged whales we tickled the other day. I thought they
      would keel up before long.”
      
      Presently, the vapors in advance slid aside; and there in the distance
      lay a ship, whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must
      be alongside. As we glided nearer, the stranger showed French colours
      from his peak; and by the eddying cloud of vulture sea-fowl that
      circled, and hovered, and swooped around him, it was plain that the
      whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale, that
      is, a whale that has died unmolested on the sea, and so floated an
      unappropriated corpse. It may well be conceived, what an unsavory odor
      such a mass must exhale; worse than an Assyrian city in the plague,
      when the living are incompetent to bury the departed. So intolerable
      indeed is it regarded by some, that no cupidity could persuade them to
      moor alongside of it. Yet are there those who will still do it;
      notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of
      a very inferior quality, and by no means of the nature of
      attar-of-rose.
      
      Coming still nearer with the expiring breeze, we saw that the Frenchman
      had a second whale alongside; and this second whale seemed even more of
      a nosegay than the first. In truth, it turned out to be one of those
      problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of
      prodigious dyspepsia, or indigestion; leaving their defunct bodies
      almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil. Nevertheless, in the
      proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up
      his nose at such a whale as this, however much he may shun blasted
      whales in general.
      
      The Pequod had now swept so nigh to the stranger, that Stubb vowed he
      recognised his cutting spade-pole entangled in the lines that were
      knotted round the tail of one of these whales.
      
      “There’s a pretty fellow, now,” he banteringly laughed, standing in the
      ship’s bows, “there’s a jackal for ye! I well know that these Crappoes
      of Frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery; sometimes lowering
      their boats for breakers, mistaking them for Sperm Whale spouts; yes,
      and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of
      tallow candles, and cases of snuffers, foreseeing that all the oil they
      will get won’t be enough to dip the Captain’s wick into; aye, we all
      know these things; but look ye, here’s a Crappo that is content with
      our leavings, the drugged whale there, I mean; aye, and is content too
      with scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there.
      Poor devil! I say, pass round a hat, some one, and let’s make him a
      present of a little oil for dear charity’s sake. For what oil he’ll get
      from that drugged whale there, wouldn’t be fit to burn in a jail; no,
      not in a condemned cell. And as for the other whale, why, I’ll agree to
      get more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours,
      than he’ll get from that bundle of bones; though, now that I think of
      it, it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil; yes,
      ambergris. I wonder now if our old man has thought of that. It’s worth
      trying. Yes, I’m for it;” and so saying he started for the
      quarter-deck.
      
      By this time the faint air had become a complete calm; so that whether
      or no, the Pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell, with no hope
      of escaping except by its breezing up again. Issuing from the cabin,
      Stubb now called his boat’s crew, and pulled off for the stranger.
      Drawing across her bow, he perceived that in accordance with the
      fanciful French taste, the upper part of her stem-piece was carved in
      the likeness of a huge drooping stalk, was painted green, and for
      thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there; the whole
      terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour. Upon
      her head boards, in large gilt letters, he read “Bouton de
      Rose,”—Rose-button, or Rose-bud; and this was the romantic name of this
      aromatic ship.
      
      Though Stubb did not understand the _Bouton_ part of the inscription,
      yet the word _rose_, and the bulbous figure-head put together,
      sufficiently explained the whole to him.
      
      “A wooden rose-bud, eh?” he cried with his hand to his nose, “that will
      do very well; but how like all creation it smells!”
      
      Now in order to hold direct communication with the people on deck, he
      had to pull round the bows to the starboard side, and thus come close
      to the blasted whale; and so talk over it.
      
      Arrived then at this spot, with one hand still to his nose, he
      bawled—“Bouton-de-Rose, ahoy! are there any of you Bouton-de-Roses that
      speak English?”
      
      “Yes,” rejoined a Guernsey-man from the bulwarks, who turned out to be
      the chief-mate.
      
      “Well, then, my Bouton-de-Rose-bud, have you seen the White Whale?”
      
      “_What_ whale?”
      
      “The _White_ Whale—a Sperm Whale—Moby Dick, have ye seen him?
      
      “Never heard of such a whale. Cachalot Blanche! White Whale—no.”
      
      “Very good, then; good bye now, and I’ll call again in a minute.”
      
      Then rapidly pulling back towards the Pequod, and seeing Ahab leaning
      over the quarter-deck rail awaiting his report, he moulded his two
      hands into a trumpet and shouted—“No, Sir! No!” Upon which Ahab
      retired, and Stubb returned to the Frenchman.
      
      He now perceived that the Guernsey-man, who had just got into the
      chains, and was using a cutting-spade, had slung his nose in a sort of
      bag.
      
      “What’s the matter with your nose, there?” said Stubb. “Broke it?”
      
      “I wish it was broken, or that I didn’t have any nose at all!” answered
      the Guernsey-man, who did not seem to relish the job he was at very
      much. “But what are you holding _yours_ for?”
      
      “Oh, nothing! It’s a wax nose; I have to hold it on. Fine day, ain’t
      it? Air rather gardenny, I should say; throw us a bunch of posies, will
      ye, Bouton-de-Rose?”
      
      “What in the devil’s name do you want here?” roared the Guernseyman,
      flying into a sudden passion.
      
      “Oh! keep cool—cool? yes, that’s the word! why don’t you pack those
      whales in ice while you’re working at ’em? But joking aside, though; do
      you know, Rose-bud, that it’s all nonsense trying to get any oil out of
      such whales? As for that dried up one, there, he hasn’t a gill in his
      whole carcase.”
      
      “I know that well enough; but, d’ye see, the Captain here won’t believe
      it; this is his first voyage; he was a Cologne manufacturer before. But
      come aboard, and mayhap he’ll believe you, if he won’t me; and so I’ll
      get out of this dirty scrape.”
      
      “Anything to oblige ye, my sweet and pleasant fellow,” rejoined Stubb,
      and with that he soon mounted to the deck. There a queer scene
      presented itself. The sailors, in tasselled caps of red worsted, were
      getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales. But they worked
      rather slow and talked very fast, and seemed in anything but a good
      humor. All their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many
      jib-booms. Now and then pairs of them would drop their work, and run up
      to the mast-head to get some fresh air. Some thinking they would catch
      the plague, dipped oakum in coal-tar, and at intervals held it to their
      nostrils. Others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short
      off at the bowl, were vigorously puffing tobacco-smoke, so that it
      constantly filled their olfactories.
      
      Stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from
      the Captain’s round-house abaft; and looking in that direction saw a
      fiery face thrust from behind the door, which was held ajar from
      within. This was the tormented surgeon, who, after in vain
      remonstrating against the proceedings of the day, had betaken himself
      to the Captain’s round-house (_cabinet_ he called it) to avoid the
      pest; but still, could not help yelling out his entreaties and
      indignations at times.
      
      Marking all this, Stubb argued well for his scheme, and turning to the
      Guernsey-man had a little chat with him, during which the stranger mate
      expressed his detestation of his Captain as a conceited ignoramus, who
      had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle.
      Sounding him carefully, Stubb further perceived that the Guernsey-man
      had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris. He therefore
      held his peace on that head, but otherwise was quite frank and
      confidential with him, so that the two quickly concocted a little plan
      for both circumventing and satirizing the Captain, without his at all
      dreaming of distrusting their sincerity. According to this little plan
      of theirs, the Guernsey-man, under cover of an interpreter’s office,
      was to tell the Captain what he pleased, but as coming from Stubb; and
      as for Stubb, he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost
      in him during the interview.
      
      By this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin. He was a
      small and dark, but rather delicate looking man for a sea-captain, with
      large whiskers and moustache, however; and wore a red cotton velvet
      vest with watch-seals at his side. To this gentleman, Stubb was now
      politely introduced by the Guernsey-man, who at once ostentatiously put
      on the aspect of interpreting between them.
      
      “What shall I say to him first?” said he.
      
      “Why,” said Stubb, eyeing the velvet vest and the watch and seals, “you
      may as well begin by telling him that he looks a sort of babyish to me,
      though I don’t pretend to be a judge.”
      
      “He says, Monsieur,” said the Guernsey-man, in French, turning to his
      captain, “that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel, whose captain
      and chief-mate, with six sailors, had all died of a fever caught from a
      blasted whale they had brought alongside.”
      
      Upon this the captain started, and eagerly desired to know more.
      
      “What now?” said the Guernsey-man to Stubb.
      
      “Why, since he takes it so easy, tell him that now I have eyed him
      carefully, I’m quite certain that he’s no more fit to command a
      whale-ship than a St. Jago monkey. In fact, tell him from me he’s a
      baboon.”
      
      “He vows and declares, Monsieur, that the other whale, the dried one,
      is far more deadly than the blasted one; in fine, Monsieur, he conjures
      us, as we value our lives, to cut loose from these fish.”
      
      Instantly the captain ran forward, and in a loud voice commanded his
      crew to desist from hoisting the cutting-tackles, and at once cast
      loose the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.
      
      “What now?” said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to
      them.
      
      “Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that—that—in fact,
      tell him I’ve diddled him, and (aside to himself) perhaps somebody
      else.”
      
      “He says, Monsieur, that he’s very happy to have been of any service to
      us.”
      
      Hearing this, the captain vowed that they were the grateful parties
      (meaning himself and mate) and concluded by inviting Stubb down into
      his cabin to drink a bottle of Bordeaux.
      
      “He wants you to take a glass of wine with him,” said the interpreter.
      
      “Thank him heartily; but tell him it’s against my principles to drink
      with the man I’ve diddled. In fact, tell him I must go.”
      
      “He says, Monsieur, that his principles won’t admit of his drinking;
      but that if Monsieur wants to live another day to drink, then Monsieur
      had best drop all four boats, and pull the ship away from these whales,
      for it’s so calm they won’t drift.”
      
      By this time Stubb was over the side, and getting into his boat, hailed
      the Guernsey-man to this effect,—that having a long tow-line in his
      boat, he would do what he could to help them, by pulling out the
      lighter whale of the two from the ship’s side. While the Frenchman’s
      boats, then, were engaged in towing the ship one way, Stubb
      benevolently towed away at his whale the other way, ostentatiously
      slacking out a most unusually long tow-line.
      
      Presently a breeze sprang up; Stubb feigned to cast off from the whale;
      hoisting his boats, the Frenchman soon increased his distance, while
      the Pequod slid in between him and Stubb’s whale. Whereupon Stubb
      quickly pulled to the floating body, and hailing the Pequod to give
      notice of his intentions, at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his
      unrighteous cunning. Seizing his sharp boat-spade, he commenced an
      excavation in the body, a little behind the side fin. You would almost
      have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea; and when at
      length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs, it was like turning up
      old Roman tiles and pottery buried in fat English loam. His boat’s crew
      were all in high excitement, eagerly helping their chief, and looking
      as anxious as gold-hunters.
      
      And all the time numberless fowls were diving, and ducking, and
      screaming, and yelling, and fighting around them. Stubb was beginning
      to look disappointed, especially as the horrible nosegay increased,
      when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague, there stole a
      faint stream of perfume, which flowed through the tide of bad smells
      without being absorbed by it, as one river will flow into and then
      along with another, without at all blending with it for a time.
      
      “I have it, I have it,” cried Stubb, with delight, striking something
      in the subterranean regions, “a purse! a purse!”
      
      Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of
      something that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old
      cheese; very unctuous and savory withal. You might easily dent it with
      your thumb; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour. And this,
      good friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any
      druggist. Some six handfuls were obtained; but more was unavoidably
      lost in the sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured were
      it not for impatient Ahab’s loud command to Stubb to desist, and come
      on board, else the ship would bid them good bye.
      
      
      CHAPTER 92. Ambergris.
      
      Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as an
      article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain
      Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that
      subject. For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively late day,
      the precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber itself, a problem
      to the learned. Though the word ambergris is but the French compound
      for grey amber, yet the two substances are quite distinct. For amber,
      though at times found on the sea-coast, is also dug up in some far
      inland soils, whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea.
      Besides, amber is a hard, transparent, brittle, odorless substance,
      used for mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and ornaments; but ambergris
      is soft, waxy, and so highly fragrant and spicy, that it is largely
      used in perfumery, in pastiles, precious candles, hair-powders, and
      pomatum. The Turks use it in cooking, and also carry it to Mecca, for
      the same purpose that frankincense is carried to St. Peter’s in Rome.
      Some wine merchants drop a few grains into claret, to flavor it.
      
      Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should
      regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a
      sick whale! Yet so it is. By some, ambergris is supposed to be the
      cause, and by others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale. How to
      cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering
      three or four boat loads of Brandreth’s pills, and then running out of
      harm’s way, as laborers do in blasting rocks.
      
      I have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris,
      certain hard, round, bony plates, which at first Stubb thought might be
      sailors’ trowsers buttons; but it afterwards turned out that they were
      nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner.
      
      Now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be
      found in the heart of such decay; is this nothing? Bethink thee of that
      saying of St. Paul in Corinthians, about corruption and incorruption;
      how that we are sown in dishonor, but raised in glory. And likewise
      call to mind that saying of Paracelsus about what it is that maketh the
      best musk. Also forget not the strange fact that of all things of
      ill-savor, Cologne-water, in its rudimental manufacturing stages, is
      the worst.
      
      I should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal, but
      cannot, owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against
      whalemen, and which, in the estimation of some already biased minds,
      might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said
      of the Frenchman’s two whales. Elsewhere in this volume the slanderous
      aspersion has been disproved, that the vocation of whaling is
      throughout a slatternly, untidy business. But there is another thing to
      rebut. They hint that all whales always smell bad. Now how did this
      odious stigma originate?
      
      I opine, that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the
      Greenland whaling ships in London, more than two centuries ago. Because
      those whalemen did not then, and do not now, try out their oil at sea
      as the Southern ships have always done; but cutting up the fresh
      blubber in small bits, thrust it through the bung holes of large casks,
      and carry it home in that manner; the shortness of the season in those
      Icy Seas, and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed,
      forbidding any other course. The consequence is, that upon breaking
      into the hold, and unloading one of these whale cemeteries, in the
      Greenland dock, a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising
      from excavating an old city grave-yard, for the foundations of a
      Lying-in Hospital.
      
      I partly surmise also, that this wicked charge against whalers may be
      likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of Greenland, in former
      times, of a Dutch village called Schmerenburgh or Smeerenberg, which
      latter name is the one used by the learned Fogo Von Slack, in his great
      work on Smells, a text-book on that subject. As its name imports
      (smeer, fat; berg, to put up), this village was founded in order to
      afford a place for the blubber of the Dutch whale fleet to be tried
      out, without being taken home to Holland for that purpose. It was a
      collection of furnaces, fat-kettles, and oil sheds; and when the works
      were in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor. But
      all this is quite different with a South Sea Sperm Whaler; which in a
      voyage of four years perhaps, after completely filling her hold with
      oil, does not, perhaps, consume fifty days in the business of boiling
      out; and in the state that it is casked, the oil is nearly scentless.
      The truth is, that living or dead, if but decently treated, whales as a
      species are by no means creatures of ill odor; nor can whalemen be
      recognised, as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a Jew
      in the company, by the nose. Nor indeed can the whale possibly be
      otherwise than fragrant, when, as a general thing, he enjoys such high
      health; taking abundance of exercise; always out of doors; though, it
      is true, seldom in the open air. I say, that the motion of a Sperm
      Whale’s flukes above water dispenses a perfume, as when a musk-scented
      lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor. What then shall I liken the
      Sperm Whale to for fragrance, considering his magnitude? Must it not be
      to that famous elephant, with jewelled tusks, and redolent with myrrh,
      which was led out of an Indian town to do honor to Alexander the Great?
      
      
      CHAPTER 93. The Castaway.
      
      It was but some few days after encountering the Frenchman, that a most
      significant event befell the most insignificant of the Pequod’s crew;
      an event most lamentable; and which ended in providing the sometimes
      madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying
      prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own.
      
      Now, in the whale ship, it is not every one that goes in the boats.
      Some few hands are reserved called ship-keepers, whose province it is
      to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale. As a general
      thing, these ship-keepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising
      the boats’ crews. But if there happen to be an unduly slender, clumsy,
      or timorous wight in the ship, that wight is certain to be made a
      ship-keeper. It was so in the Pequod with the little negro Pippin by
      nick-name, Pip by abbreviation. Poor Pip! ye have heard of him before;
      ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight, so
      gloomy-jolly.
      
      In outer aspect, Pip and Dough-Boy made a match, like a black pony and
      a white one, of equal developments, though of dissimilar colour, driven
      in one eccentric span. But while hapless Dough-Boy was by nature dull
      and torpid in his intellects, Pip, though over tender-hearted, was at
      bottom very bright, with that pleasant, genial, jolly brightness
      peculiar to his tribe; a tribe, which ever enjoy all holidays and
      festivities with finer, freer relish than any other race. For blacks,
      the year’s calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixty-five
      Fourth of Julys and New Year’s Days. Nor smile so, while I write that
      this little black was brilliant, for even blackness has its brilliancy;
      behold yon lustrous ebony, panelled in king’s cabinets. But Pip loved
      life, and all life’s peaceable securities; so that the panic-striking
      business in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped, had
      most sadly blurred his brightness; though, as ere long will be seen,
      what was thus temporarily subdued in him, in the end was destined to be
      luridly illumined by strange wild fires, that fictitiously showed him
      off to ten times the natural lustre with which in his native Tolland
      County in Connecticut, he had once enlivened many a fiddler’s frolic on
      the green; and at melodious even-tide, with his gay ha-ha! had turned
      the round horizon into one star-belled tambourine. So, though in the
      clear air of day, suspended against a blue-veined neck, the
      pure-watered diamond drop will healthful glow; yet, when the cunning
      jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre, he
      lays it against a gloomy ground, and then lights it up, not by the sun,
      but by some unnatural gases. Then come out those fiery effulgences,
      infernally superb; then the evil-blazing diamond, once the divinest
      symbol of the crystal skies, looks like some crown-jewel stolen from
      the King of Hell. But let us to the story.
      
      It came to pass, that in the ambergris affair Stubb’s after-oarsman
      chanced so to sprain his hand, as for a time to become quite maimed;
      and, temporarily, Pip was put into his place.
      
      The first time Stubb lowered with him, Pip evinced much nervousness;
      but happily, for that time, escaped close contact with the whale; and
      therefore came off not altogether discreditably; though Stubb observing
      him, took care, afterwards, to exhort him to cherish his courageousness
      to the utmost, for he might often find it needful.
      
      Now upon the second lowering, the boat paddled upon the whale; and as
      the fish received the darted iron, it gave its customary rap, which
      happened, in this instance, to be right under poor Pip’s seat. The
      involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap, paddle in
      hand, out of the boat; and in such a way, that part of the slack whale
      line coming against his chest, he breasted it overboard with him, so as
      to become entangled in it, when at last plumping into the water. That
      instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run, the line swiftly
      straightened; and presto! poor Pip came all foaming up to the chocks of
      the boat, remorselessly dragged there by the line, which had taken
      several turns around his chest and neck.
      
      Tashtego stood in the bows. He was full of the fire of the hunt. He
      hated Pip for a poltroon. Snatching the boat-knife from its sheath, he
      suspended its sharp edge over the line, and turning towards Stubb,
      exclaimed interrogatively, “Cut?” Meantime Pip’s blue, choked face
      plainly looked, Do, for God’s sake! All passed in a flash. In less than
      half a minute, this entire thing happened.
      
      “Damn him, cut!” roared Stubb; and so the whale was lost and Pip was
      saved.
      
      So soon as he recovered himself, the poor little negro was assailed by
      yells and execrations from the crew. Tranquilly permitting these
      irregular cursings to evaporate, Stubb then in a plain, business-like,
      but still half humorous manner, cursed Pip officially; and that done,
      unofficially gave him much wholesome advice. The substance was, Never
      jump from a boat, Pip, except—but all the rest was indefinite, as the
      soundest advice ever is. Now, in general, _Stick to the boat_, is your
      true motto in whaling; but cases will sometimes happen when _Leap from
      the boat_, is still better. Moreover, as if perceiving at last that if
      he should give undiluted conscientious advice to Pip, he would be
      leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future; Stubb suddenly
      dropped all advice, and concluded with a peremptory command, “Stick to
      the boat, Pip, or by the Lord, I won’t pick you up if you jump; mind
      that. We can’t afford to lose whales by the likes of you; a whale would
      sell for thirty times what you would, Pip, in Alabama. Bear that in
      mind, and don’t jump any more.” Hereby perhaps Stubb indirectly hinted,
      that though man loved his fellow, yet man is a money-making animal,
      which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence.
      
      But we are all in the hands of the Gods; and Pip jumped again. It was
      under very similar circumstances to the first performance; but this
      time he did not breast out the line; and hence, when the whale started
      to run, Pip was left behind on the sea, like a hurried traveller’s
      trunk. Alas! Stubb was but too true to his word. It was a beautiful,
      bounteous, blue day; the spangled sea calm and cool, and flatly
      stretching away, all round, to the horizon, like gold-beater’s skin
      hammered out to the extremest. Bobbing up and down in that sea, Pip’s
      ebon head showed like a head of cloves. No boat-knife was lifted when
      he fell so rapidly astern. Stubb’s inexorable back was turned upon him;
      and the whale was winged. In three minutes, a whole mile of shoreless
      ocean was between Pip and Stubb. Out from the centre of the sea, poor
      Pip turned his crisp, curling, black head to the sun, another lonely
      castaway, though the loftiest and the brightest.
      
      Now, in calm weather, to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the
      practised swimmer as to ride in a spring-carriage ashore. But the awful
      lonesomeness is intolerable. The intense concentration of self in the
      middle of such a heartless immensity, my God! who can tell it? Mark,
      how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open sea—mark how closely
      they hug their ship and only coast along her sides.
      
      But had Stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate? No;
      he did not mean to, at least. Because there were two boats in his wake,
      and he supposed, no doubt, that they would of course come up to Pip
      very quickly, and pick him up; though, indeed, such considerations
      towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity, is not always
      manifested by the hunters in all similar instances; and such instances
      not unfrequently occur; almost invariably in the fishery, a coward, so
      called, is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to
      military navies and armies.
      
      But it so happened, that those boats, without seeing Pip, suddenly
      spying whales close to them on one side, turned, and gave chase; and
      Stubb’s boat was now so far away, and he and all his crew so intent
      upon his fish, that Pip’s ringed horizon began to expand around him
      miserably. By the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him;
      but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot; such,
      at least, they said he was. The sea had jeeringly kept his finite body
      up, but drowned the infinite of his soul. Not drowned entirely, though.
      Rather carried down alive to wondrous depths, where strange shapes of
      the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes;
      and the miser-merman, Wisdom, revealed his hoarded heaps; and among the
      joyous, heartless, ever-juvenile eternities, Pip saw the multitudinous,
      God-omnipresent, coral insects, that out of the firmament of waters
      heaved the colossal orbs. He saw God’s foot upon the treadle of the
      loom, and spoke it; and therefore his shipmates called him mad. So
      man’s insanity is heaven’s sense; and wandering from all mortal reason,
      man comes at last to that celestial thought, which, to reason, is
      absurd and frantic; and weal or woe, feels then uncompromised,
      indifferent as his God.
      
      For the rest, blame not Stubb too hardly. The thing is common in that
      fishery; and in the sequel of the narrative, it will then be seen what
      like abandonment befell myself.
      
      
      CHAPTER 94. A Squeeze of the Hand.
      
      That whale of Stubb’s, so dearly purchased, was duly brought to the
      Pequod’s side, where all those cutting and hoisting operations
      previously detailed, were regularly gone through, even to the baling of
      the Heidelburgh Tun, or Case.
      
      While some were occupied with this latter duty, others were employed in
      dragging away the larger tubs, so soon as filled with the sperm; and
      when the proper time arrived, this same sperm was carefully manipulated
      ere going to the try-works, of which anon.
      
      It had cooled and crystallized to such a degree, that when, with
      several others, I sat down before a large Constantine’s bath of it, I
      found it strangely concreted into lumps, here and there rolling about
      in the liquid part. It was our business to squeeze these lumps back
      into fluid. A sweet and unctuous duty! No wonder that in old times this
      sperm was such a favourite cosmetic. Such a clearer! such a sweetener!
      such a softener! such a delicious molifier! After having my hands in it
      for only a few minutes, my fingers felt like eels, and began, as it
      were, to serpentine and spiralise.
      
      As I sat there at my ease, cross-legged on the deck; after the bitter
      exertion at the windlass; under a blue tranquil sky; the ship under
      indolent sail, and gliding so serenely along; as I bathed my hands
      among those soft, gentle globules of infiltrated tissues, woven almost
      within the hour; as they richly broke to my fingers, and discharged all
      their opulence, like fully ripe grapes their wine; as I snuffed up that
      uncontaminated aroma,—literally and truly, like the smell of spring
      violets; I declare to you, that for the time I lived as in a musky
      meadow; I forgot all about our horrible oath; in that inexpressible
      sperm, I washed my hands and my heart of it; I almost began to credit
      the old Paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in
      allaying the heat of anger; while bathing in that bath, I felt divinely
      free from all ill-will, or petulance, or malice, of any sort
      whatsoever.
      
      Squeeze! squeeze! squeeze! all the morning long; I squeezed that sperm
      till I myself almost melted into it; I squeezed that sperm till a
      strange sort of insanity came over me; and I found myself unwittingly
      squeezing my co-laborers’ hands in it, mistaking their hands for the
      gentle globules. Such an abounding, affectionate, friendly, loving
      feeling did this avocation beget; that at last I was continually
      squeezing their hands, and looking up into their eyes sentimentally; as
      much as to say,—Oh! my dear fellow beings, why should we longer cherish
      any social acerbities, or know the slightest ill-humor or envy! Come;
      let us squeeze hands all round; nay, let us all squeeze ourselves into
      each other; let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and
      sperm of kindness.
      
      Would that I could keep squeezing that sperm for ever! For now, since
      by many prolonged, repeated experiences, I have perceived that in all
      cases man must eventually lower, or at least shift, his conceit of
      attainable felicity; not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the
      fancy; but in the wife, the heart, the bed, the table, the saddle, the
      fireside, the country; now that I have perceived all this, I am ready
      to squeeze case eternally. In thoughts of the visions of the night, I
      saw long rows of angels in paradise, each with his hands in a jar of
      spermaceti.
      
      Now, while discoursing of sperm, it behooves to speak of other things
      akin to it, in the business of preparing the sperm whale for the
      try-works.
      
      First comes white-horse, so called, which is obtained from the tapering
      part of the fish, and also from the thicker portions of his flukes. It
      is tough with congealed tendons—a wad of muscle—but still contains some
      oil. After being severed from the whale, the white-horse is first cut
      into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer. They look much like
      blocks of Berkshire marble.
      
      Plum-pudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the
      whale’s flesh, here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber, and
      often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness. It is
      a most refreshing, convivial, beautiful object to behold. As its name
      imports, it is of an exceedingly rich, mottled tint, with a bestreaked
      snowy and golden ground, dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and
      purple. It is plums of rubies, in pictures of citron. Spite of reason,
      it is hard to keep yourself from eating it. I confess, that once I
      stole behind the foremast to try it. It tasted something as I should
      conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of Louis le Gros might have
      tasted, supposing him to have been killed the first day after the
      venison season, and that particular venison season contemporary with an
      unusually fine vintage of the vineyards of Champagne.
      
      There is another substance, and a very singular one, which turns up in
      the course of this business, but which I feel it to be very puzzling
      adequately to describe. It is called slobgollion; an appellation
      original with the whalemen, and even so is the nature of the substance.
      It is an ineffably oozy, stringy affair, most frequently found in the
      tubs of sperm, after a prolonged squeezing, and subsequent decanting. I
      hold it to be the wondrously thin, ruptured membranes of the case,
      coalescing.
      
      Gurry, so called, is a term properly belonging to right whalemen, but
      sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen. It designates the
      dark, glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the
      Greenland or right whale, and much of which covers the decks of those
      inferior souls who hunt that ignoble Leviathan.
      
      Nippers. Strictly this word is not indigenous to the whale’s
      vocabulary. But as applied by whalemen, it becomes so. A whaleman’s
      nipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering
      part of Leviathan’s tail: it averages an inch in thickness, and for the
      rest, is about the size of the iron part of a hoe. Edgewise moved along
      the oily deck, it operates like a leathern squilgee; and by nameless
      blandishments, as of magic, allures along with it all impurities.
      
      But to learn all about these recondite matters, your best way is at
      once to descend into the blubber-room, and have a long talk with its
      inmates. This place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for
      the blanket-pieces, when stript and hoisted from the whale. When the
      proper time arrives for cutting up its contents, this apartment is a
      scene of terror to all tyros, especially by night. On one side, lit by
      a dull lantern, a space has been left clear for the workmen. They
      generally go in pairs,—a pike-and-gaffman and a spade-man. The
      whaling-pike is similar to a frigate’s boarding-weapon of the same
      name. The gaff is something like a boat-hook. With his gaff, the
      gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber, and strives to hold it from
      slipping, as the ship pitches and lurches about. Meanwhile, the
      spade-man stands on the sheet itself, perpendicularly chopping it into
      the portable horse-pieces. This spade is sharp as hone can make it; the
      spademan’s feet are shoeless; the thing he stands on will sometimes
      irresistibly slide away from him, like a sledge. If he cuts off one of
      his own toes, or one of his assistants’, would you be very much
      astonished? Toes are scarce among veteran blubber-room men.
      
      
      CHAPTER 95. The Cassock.
      
      Had you stepped on board the Pequod at a certain juncture of this
      post-mortemizing of the whale; and had you strolled forward nigh the
      windlass, pretty sure am I that you would have scanned with no small
      curiosity a very strange, enigmatical object, which you would have seen
      there, lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers. Not the wondrous
      cistern in the whale’s huge head; not the prodigy of his unhinged lower
      jaw; not the miracle of his symmetrical tail; none of these would so
      surprise you, as half a glimpse of that unaccountable cone,—longer than
      a Kentuckian is tall, nigh a foot in diameter at the base, and
      jet-black as Yojo, the ebony idol of Queequeg. And an idol, indeed, it
      is; or, rather, in old times, its likeness was. Such an idol as that
      found in the secret groves of Queen Maachah in Judea; and for
      worshipping which, King Asa, her son, did depose her, and destroyed the
      idol, and burnt it for an abomination at the brook Kedron, as darkly
      set forth in the 15th chapter of the First Book of Kings.
      
      Look at the sailor, called the mincer, who now comes along, and
      assisted by two allies, heavily backs the grandissimus, as the mariners
      call it, and with bowed shoulders, staggers off with it as if he were a
      grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field. Extending it upon the
      forecastle deck, he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt,
      as an African hunter the pelt of a boa. This done he turns the pelt
      inside out, like a pantaloon leg; gives it a good stretching, so as
      almost to double its diameter; and at last hangs it, well spread, in
      the rigging, to dry. Ere long, it is taken down; when removing some
      three feet of it, towards the pointed extremity, and then cutting two
      slits for arm-holes at the other end, he lengthwise slips himself
      bodily into it. The mincer now stands before you invested in the full
      canonicals of his calling. Immemorial to all his order, this
      investiture alone will adequately protect him, while employed in the
      peculiar functions of his office.
      
      That office consists in mincing the horse-pieces of blubber for the
      pots; an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse,
      planted endwise against the bulwarks, and with a capacious tub beneath
      it, into which the minced pieces drop, fast as the sheets from a rapt
      orator’s desk. Arrayed in decent black; occupying a conspicuous pulpit;
      intent on bible leaves; what a candidate for an archbishopric, what a
      lad for a Pope were this mincer!*
      
      *Bible leaves! Bible leaves! This is the invariable cry from the mates
      to the mincer. It enjoins him to be careful, and cut his work into as
      thin slices as possible, inasmuch as by so doing the business of
      boiling out the oil is much accelerated, and its quantity considerably
      increased, besides perhaps improving it in quality.
      
      
      CHAPTER 96. The Try-Works.
      
      Besides her hoisted boats, an American whaler is outwardly
      distinguished by her try-works. She presents the curious anomaly of the
      most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the
      completed ship. It is as if from the open field a brick-kiln were
      transported to her planks.
      
      The try-works are planted between the foremast and mainmast, the most
      roomy part of the deck. The timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength,
      fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and
      mortar, some ten feet by eight square, and five in height. The
      foundation does not penetrate the deck, but the masonry is firmly
      secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all
      sides, and screwing it down to the timbers. On the flanks it is cased
      with wood, and at top completely covered by a large, sloping, battened
      hatchway. Removing this hatch we expose the great try-pots, two in
      number, and each of several barrels’ capacity. When not in use, they
      are kept remarkably clean. Sometimes they are polished with soapstone
      and sand, till they shine within like silver punch-bowls. During the
      night-watches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil
      themselves away there for a nap. While employed in polishing them—one
      man in each pot, side by side—many confidential communications are
      carried on, over the iron lips. It is a place also for profound
      mathematical meditation. It was in the left hand try-pot of the Pequod,
      with the soapstone diligently circling round me, that I was first
      indirectly struck by the remarkable fact, that in geometry all bodies
      gliding along the cycloid, my soapstone for example, will descend from
      any point in precisely the same time.
      
      Removing the fire-board from the front of the try-works, the bare
      masonry of that side is exposed, penetrated by the two iron mouths of
      the furnaces, directly underneath the pots. These mouths are fitted
      with heavy doors of iron. The intense heat of the fire is prevented
      from communicating itself to the deck, by means of a shallow reservoir
      extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works. By a tunnel
      inserted at the rear, this reservoir is kept replenished with water as
      fast as it evaporates. There are no external chimneys; they open direct
      from the rear wall. And here let us go back for a moment.
      
      It was about nine o’clock at night that the Pequod’s try-works were
      first started on this present voyage. It belonged to Stubb to oversee
      the business.
      
      “All ready there? Off hatch, then, and start her. You cook, fire the
      works.” This was an easy thing, for the carpenter had been thrusting
      his shavings into the furnace throughout the passage. Here be it said
      that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the try-works has to be fed
      for a time with wood. After that no wood is used, except as a means of
      quick ignition to the staple fuel. In a word, after being tried out,
      the crisp, shrivelled blubber, now called scraps or fritters, still
      contains considerable of its unctuous properties. These fritters feed
      the flames. Like a plethoric burning martyr, or a self-consuming
      misanthrope, once ignited, the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by
      his own body. Would that he consumed his own smoke! for his smoke is
      horrible to inhale, and inhale it you must, and not only that, but you
      must live in it for the time. It has an unspeakable, wild, Hindoo odor
      about it, such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres. It smells
      like the left wing of the day of judgment; it is an argument for the
      pit.
      
      By midnight the works were in full operation. We were clear from the
      carcase; sail had been made; the wind was freshening; the wild ocean
      darkness was intense. But that darkness was licked up by the fierce
      flames, which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues, and
      illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging, as with the famed Greek
      fire. The burning ship drove on, as if remorselessly commissioned to
      some vengeful deed. So the pitch and sulphur-freighted brigs of the
      bold Hydriote, Canaris, issuing from their midnight harbors, with broad
      sheets of flame for sails, bore down upon the Turkish frigates, and
      folded them in conflagrations.
      
      The hatch, removed from the top of the works, now afforded a wide
      hearth in front of them. Standing on this were the Tartarean shapes of
      the pagan harpooneers, always the whale-ship’s stokers. With huge
      pronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding
      pots, or stirred up the fires beneath, till the snaky flames darted,
      curling, out of the doors to catch them by the feet. The smoke rolled
      away in sullen heaps. To every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of
      the boiling oil, which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces.
      Opposite the mouth of the works, on the further side of the wide wooden
      hearth, was the windlass. This served for a sea-sofa. Here lounged the
      watch, when not otherwise employed, looking into the red heat of the
      fire, till their eyes felt scorched in their heads. Their tawny
      features, now all begrimed with smoke and sweat, their matted beards,
      and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth, all these were
      strangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works. As they
      narrated to each other their unholy adventures, their tales of terror
      told in words of mirth; as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards
      out of them, like the flames from the furnace; as to and fro, in their
      front, the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged
      forks and dippers; as the wind howled on, and the sea leaped, and the
      ship groaned and dived, and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further
      and further into the blackness of the sea and the night, and scornfully
      champed the white bone in her mouth, and viciously spat round her on
      all sides; then the rushing Pequod, freighted with savages, and laden
      with fire, and burning a corpse, and plunging into that blackness of
      darkness, seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commander’s
      soul.
      
      So seemed it to me, as I stood at her helm, and for long hours silently
      guided the way of this fire-ship on the sea. Wrapped, for that
      interval, in darkness myself, I but the better saw the redness, the
      madness, the ghastliness of others. The continual sight of the fiend
      shapes before me, capering half in smoke and half in fire, these at
      last begat kindred visions in my soul, so soon as I began to yield to
      that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me at a
      midnight helm.
      
      But that night, in particular, a strange (and ever since inexplicable)
      thing occurred to me. Starting from a brief standing sleep, I was
      horribly conscious of something fatally wrong. The jaw-bone tiller
      smote my side, which leaned against it; in my ears was the low hum of
      sails, just beginning to shake in the wind; I thought my eyes were
      open; I was half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and
      mechanically stretching them still further apart. But, spite of all
      this, I could see no compass before me to steer by; though it seemed
      but a minute since I had been watching the card, by the steady binnacle
      lamp illuminating it. Nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom, now and
      then made ghastly by flashes of redness. Uppermost was the impression,
      that whatever swift, rushing thing I stood on was not so much bound to
      any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern. A stark, bewildered
      feeling, as of death, came over me. Convulsively my hands grasped the
      tiller, but with the crazy conceit that the tiller was, somehow, in
      some enchanted way, inverted. My God! what is the matter with me?
      thought I. Lo! in my brief sleep I had turned myself about, and was
      fronting the ship’s stern, with my back to her prow and the compass. In
      an instant I faced back, just in time to prevent the vessel from flying
      up into the wind, and very probably capsizing her. How glad and how
      grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night, and
      the fatal contingency of being brought by the lee!
      
      Look not too long in the face of the fire, O man! Never dream with thy
      hand on the helm! Turn not thy back to the compass; accept the first
      hint of the hitching tiller; believe not the artificial fire, when its
      redness makes all things look ghastly. To-morrow, in the natural sun,
      the skies will be bright; those who glared like devils in the forking
      flames, the morn will show in far other, at least gentler, relief; the
      glorious, golden, glad sun, the only true lamp—all others but liars!
      
      Nevertheless the sun hides not Virginia’s Dismal Swamp, nor Rome’s
      accursed Campagna, nor wide Sahara, nor all the millions of miles of
      deserts and of griefs beneath the moon. The sun hides not the ocean,
      which is the dark side of this earth, and which is two thirds of this
      earth. So, therefore, that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow
      in him, that mortal man cannot be true—not true, or undeveloped. With
      books the same. The truest of all men was the Man of Sorrows, and the
      truest of all books is Solomon’s, and Ecclesiastes is the fine hammered
      steel of woe. “All is vanity.” ALL. This wilful world hath not got hold
      of unchristian Solomon’s wisdom yet. But he who dodges hospitals and
      jails, and walks fast crossing graveyards, and would rather talk of
      operas than hell; calls Cowper, Young, Pascal, Rousseau, poor devils
      all of sick men; and throughout a care-free lifetime swears by Rabelais
      as passing wise, and therefore jolly;—not that man is fitted to sit
      down on tomb-stones, and break the green damp mould with unfathomably
      wondrous Solomon.
      
      But even Solomon, he says, “the man that wandereth out of the way of
      understanding shall remain” (_i.e._, even while living) “in the
      congregation of the dead.” Give not thyself up, then, to fire, lest it
      invert thee, deaden thee; as for the time it did me. There is a wisdom
      that is woe; but there is a woe that is madness. And there is a
      Catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest
      gorges, and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny
      spaces. And even if he for ever flies within the gorge, that gorge is
      in the mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle
      is still higher than other birds upon the plain, even though they soar.
      
      
      CHAPTER 97. The Lamp.
      
      Had you descended from the Pequod’s try-works to the Pequod’s
      forecastle, where the off duty watch were sleeping, for one single
      moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some
      illuminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors. There they lay
      in their triangular oaken vaults, each mariner a chiselled muteness; a
      score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes.
      
      In merchantmen, oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of
      queens. To dress in the dark, and eat in the dark, and stumble in
      darkness to his pallet, this is his usual lot. But the whaleman, as he
      seeks the food of light, so he lives in light. He makes his berth an
      Aladdin’s lamp, and lays him down in it; so that in the pitchiest night
      the ship’s black hull still houses an illumination.
      
      See with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of
      lamps—often but old bottles and vials, though—to the copper cooler at
      the try-works, and replenishes them there, as mugs of ale at a vat. He
      burns, too, the purest of oil, in its unmanufactured, and, therefore,
      unvitiated state; a fluid unknown to solar, lunar, or astral
      contrivances ashore. It is sweet as early grass butter in April. He
      goes and hunts for his oil, so as to be sure of its freshness and
      genuineness, even as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own
      supper of game.
      
      
      CHAPTER 98. Stowing Down and Clearing Up.
      
      Already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off
      descried from the mast-head; how he is chased over the watery moors,
      and slaughtered in the valleys of the deep; how he is then towed
      alongside and beheaded; and how (on the principle which entitled the
      headsman of old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed) his
      great padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner; how, in
      due time, he is condemned to the pots, and, like Shadrach, Meshach, and
      Abednego, his spermaceti, oil, and bone pass unscathed through the
      fire;—but now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of
      the description by rehearsing—singing, if I may—the romantic proceeding
      of decanting off his oil into the casks and striking them down into the
      hold, where once again leviathan returns to his native profundities,
      sliding along beneath the surface as before; but, alas! never more to
      rise and blow.
      
      While still warm, the oil, like hot punch, is received into the
      six-barrel casks; and while, perhaps, the ship is pitching and rolling
      this way and that in the midnight sea, the enormous casks are slewed
      round and headed over, end for end, and sometimes perilously scoot
      across the slippery deck, like so many land slides, till at last
      man-handled and stayed in their course; and all round the hoops, rap,
      rap, go as many hammers as can play upon them, for now, _ex officio_,
      every sailor is a cooper.
      
      At length, when the last pint is casked, and all is cool, then the
      great hatchways are unsealed, the bowels of the ship are thrown open,
      and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea. This done, the
      hatches are replaced, and hermetically closed, like a closet walled up.
      
      In the sperm fishery, this is perhaps one of the most remarkable
      incidents in all the business of whaling. One day the planks stream
      with freshets of blood and oil; on the sacred quarter-deck enormous
      masses of the whale’s head are profanely piled; great rusty casks lie
      about, as in a brewery yard; the smoke from the try-works has besooted
      all the bulwarks; the mariners go about suffused with unctuousness; the
      entire ship seems great leviathan himself; while on all hands the din
      is deafening.
      
      But a day or two after, you look about you, and prick your ears in this
      self-same ship; and were it not for the tell-tale boats and try-works,
      you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel, with a
      most scrupulously neat commander. The unmanufactured sperm oil
      possesses a singularly cleansing virtue. This is the reason why the
      decks never look so white as just after what they call an affair of
      oil. Besides, from the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale, a
      potent lye is readily made; and whenever any adhesiveness from the back
      of the whale remains clinging to the side, that lye quickly
      exterminates it. Hands go diligently along the bulwarks, and with
      buckets of water and rags restore them to their full tidiness. The soot
      is brushed from the lower rigging. All the numerous implements which
      have been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put away. The
      great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the try-works, completely
      hiding the pots; every cask is out of sight; all tackles are coiled in
      unseen nooks; and when by the combined and simultaneous industry of
      almost the entire ship’s company, the whole of this conscientious duty
      is at last concluded, then the crew themselves proceed to their own
      ablutions; shift themselves from top to toe; and finally issue to the
      immaculate deck, fresh and all aglow, as bridegrooms new-leaped from
      out the daintiest Holland.
      
      Now, with elated step, they pace the planks in twos and threes, and
      humorously discourse of parlors, sofas, carpets, and fine cambrics;
      propose to mat the deck; think of having hanging to the top; object not
      to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle. To hint to
      such musked mariners of oil, and bone, and blubber, were little short
      of audacity. They know not the thing you distantly allude to. Away, and
      bring us napkins!
      
      But mark: aloft there, at the three mast heads, stand three men intent
      on spying out more whales, which, if caught, infallibly will again soil
      the old oaken furniture, and drop at least one small grease-spot
      somewhere. Yes; and many is the time, when, after the severest
      uninterrupted labors, which know no night; continuing straight through
      for ninety-six hours; when from the boat, where they have swelled their
      wrists with all day rowing on the Line,—they only step to the deck to
      carry vast chains, and heave the heavy windlass, and cut and slash,
      yea, and in their very sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the
      combined fires of the equatorial sun and the equatorial try-works;
      when, on the heel of all this, they have finally bestirred themselves
      to cleanse the ship, and make a spotless dairy room of it; many is the
      time the poor fellows, just buttoning the necks of their clean frocks,
      are startled by the cry of “There she blows!” and away they fly to
      fight another whale, and go through the whole weary thing again. Oh! my
      friends, but this is man-killing! Yet this is life. For hardly have we
      mortals by long toilings extracted from this world’s vast bulk its
      small but valuable sperm; and then, with weary patience, cleansed
      ourselves from its defilements, and learned to live here in clean
      tabernacles of the soul; hardly is this done, when—_There she
      blows!_—the ghost is spouted up, and away we sail to fight some other
      world, and go through young life’s old routine again.
      
      Oh! the metempsychosis! Oh! Pythagoras, that in bright Greece, two
      thousand years ago, did die, so good, so wise, so mild; I sailed with
      thee along the Peruvian coast last voyage—and, foolish as I am, taught
      thee, a green simple boy, how to splice a rope!
      
      
      CHAPTER 99. The Doubloon.
      
      Ere now it has been related how Ahab was wont to pace his quarter-deck,
      taking regular turns at either limit, the binnacle and mainmast; but in
      the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been
      added how that sometimes in these walks, when most plunged in his mood,
      he was wont to pause in turn at each spot, and stand there strangely
      eyeing the particular object before him. When he halted before the
      binnacle, with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the
      compass, that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of
      his purpose; and when resuming his walk he again paused before the
      mainmast, then, as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted
      gold coin there, he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness, only
      dashed with a certain wild longing, if not hopefulness.
      
      But one morning, turning to pass the doubloon, he seemed to be newly
      attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it, as
      though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in
      some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them. And some
      certain significance lurks in all things, else all things are little
      worth, and the round world itself but an empty cipher, except to sell
      by the cartload, as they do hills about Boston, to fill up some morass
      in the Milky Way.
      
      Now this doubloon was of purest, virgin gold, raked somewhere out of
      the heart of gorgeous hills, whence, east and west, over golden sands,
      the head-waters of many a Pactolus flows. And though now nailed amidst
      all the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes,
      yet, untouchable and immaculate to any foulness, it still preserved its
      Quito glow. Nor, though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour
      passed by ruthless hands, and through the livelong nights shrouded with
      thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach, nevertheless
      every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last. For it
      was set apart and sanctified to one awe-striking end; and however
      wanton in their sailor ways, one and all, the mariners revered it as
      the white whale’s talisman. Sometimes they talked it over in the weary
      watch by night, wondering whose it was to be at last, and whether he
      would ever live to spend it.
      
      Now those noble golden coins of South America are as medals of the sun
      and tropic token-pieces. Here palms, alpacas, and volcanoes; sun’s
      disks and stars; ecliptics, horns-of-plenty, and rich banners waving,
      are in luxuriant profusion stamped; so that the precious gold seems
      almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories, by
      passing through those fancy mints, so Spanishly poetic.
      
      It so chanced that the doubloon of the Pequod was a most wealthy
      example of these things. On its round border it bore the letters,
      REPUBLICA DEL ECUADOR: QUITO. So this bright coin came from a country
      planted in the middle of the world, and beneath the great equator, and
      named after it; and it had been cast midway up the Andes, in the
      unwaning clime that knows no autumn. Zoned by those letters you saw the
      likeness of three Andes’ summits; from one a flame; a tower on another;
      on the third a crowing cock; while arching over all was a segment of
      the partitioned zodiac, the signs all marked with their usual
      cabalistics, and the keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at
      Libra.
      
      Before this equatorial coin, Ahab, not unobserved by others, was now
      pausing.
      
      “There’s something ever egotistical in mountain-tops and towers, and
      all other grand and lofty things; look here,—three peaks as proud as
      Lucifer. The firm tower, that is Ahab; the volcano, that is Ahab; the
      courageous, the undaunted, and victorious fowl, that, too, is Ahab; all
      are Ahab; and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe,
      which, like a magician’s glass, to each and every man in turn but
      mirrors back his own mysterious self. Great pains, small gains for
      those who ask the world to solve them; it cannot solve itself. Methinks
      now this coined sun wears a ruddy face; but see! aye, he enters the
      sign of storms, the equinox! and but six months before he wheeled out
      of a former equinox at Aries! From storm to storm! So be it, then. Born
      in throes, ’tis fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs! So
      be it, then! Here’s stout stuff for woe to work on. So be it, then.”
      
      “No fairy fingers can have pressed the gold, but devil’s claws must
      have left their mouldings there since yesterday,” murmured Starbuck to
      himself, leaning against the bulwarks. “The old man seems to read
      Belshazzar’s awful writing. I have never marked the coin inspectingly.
      He goes below; let me read. A dark valley between three mighty,
      heaven-abiding peaks, that almost seem the Trinity, in some faint
      earthly symbol. So in this vale of Death, God girds us round; and over
      all our gloom, the sun of Righteousness still shines a beacon and a
      hope. If we bend down our eyes, the dark vale shows her mouldy soil;
      but if we lift them, the bright sun meets our glance half way, to
      cheer. Yet, oh, the great sun is no fixture; and if, at midnight, we
      would fain snatch some sweet solace from him, we gaze for him in vain!
      This coin speaks wisely, mildly, truly, but still sadly to me. I will
      quit it, lest Truth shake me falsely.”
      
      “There now’s the old Mogul,” soliloquized Stubb by the try-works, “he’s
      been twigging it; and there goes Starbuck from the same, and both with
      faces which I should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long.
      And all from looking at a piece of gold, which did I have it now on
      Negro Hill or in Corlaer’s Hook, I’d not look at it very long ere
      spending it. Humph! in my poor, insignificant opinion, I regard this as
      queer. I have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings; your doubloons
      of old Spain, your doubloons of Peru, your doubloons of Chili, your
      doubloons of Bolivia, your doubloons of Popayan; with plenty of gold
      moidores and pistoles, and joes, and half joes, and quarter joes. What
      then should there be in this doubloon of the Equator that is so killing
      wonderful? By Golconda! let me read it once. Halloa! here’s signs and
      wonders truly! That, now, is what old Bowditch in his Epitome calls the
      zodiac, and what my almanac below calls ditto. I’ll get the almanac and
      as I have heard devils can be raised with Daboll’s arithmetic, I’ll try
      my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the
      Massachusetts calendar. Here’s the book. Let’s see now. Signs and
      wonders; and the sun, he’s always among ’em. Hem, hem, hem; here they
      are—here they go—all alive:—Aries, or the Ram; Taurus, or the Bull and
      Jimimi! here’s Gemini himself, or the Twins. Well; the sun he wheels
      among ’em. Aye, here on the coin he’s just crossing the threshold
      between two of twelve sitting-rooms all in a ring. Book! you lie there;
      the fact is, you books must know your places. You’ll do to give us the
      bare words and facts, but we come in to supply the thoughts. That’s my
      small experience, so far as the Massachusetts calendar, and Bowditch’s
      navigator, and Daboll’s arithmetic go. Signs and wonders, eh? Pity if
      there is nothing wonderful in signs, and significant in wonders!
      There’s a clue somewhere; wait a bit; hist—hark! By Jove, I have it!
      Look you, Doubloon, your zodiac here is the life of man in one round
      chapter; and now I’ll read it off, straight out of the book. Come,
      Almanack! To begin: there’s Aries, or the Ram—lecherous dog, he begets
      us; then, Taurus, or the Bull—he bumps us the first thing; then Gemini,
      or the Twins—that is, Virtue and Vice; we try to reach Virtue, when lo!
      comes Cancer the Crab, and drags us back; and here, going from Virtue,
      Leo, a roaring Lion, lies in the path—he gives a few fierce bites and
      surly dabs with his paw; we escape, and hail Virgo, the Virgin! that’s
      our first love; we marry and think to be happy for aye, when pop comes
      Libra, or the Scales—happiness weighed and found wanting; and while we
      are very sad about that, Lord! how we suddenly jump, as Scorpio, or the
      Scorpion, stings us in the rear; we are curing the wound, when whang
      come the arrows all round; Sagittarius, or the Archer, is amusing
      himself. As we pluck out the shafts, stand aside! here’s the
      battering-ram, Capricornus, or the Goat; full tilt, he comes rushing,
      and headlong we are tossed; when Aquarius, or the Water-bearer, pours
      out his whole deluge and drowns us; and to wind up with Pisces, or the
      Fishes, we sleep. There’s a sermon now, writ in high heaven, and the
      sun goes through it every year, and yet comes out of it all alive and
      hearty. Jollily he, aloft there, wheels through toil and trouble; and
      so, alow here, does jolly Stubb. Oh, jolly’s the word for aye! Adieu,
      Doubloon! But stop; here comes little King-Post; dodge round the
      try-works, now, and let’s hear what he’ll have to say. There; he’s
      before it; he’ll out with something presently. So, so; he’s beginning.”
      
      “I see nothing here, but a round thing made of gold, and whoever raises
      a certain whale, this round thing belongs to him. So, what’s all this
      staring been about? It is worth sixteen dollars, that’s true; and at
      two cents the cigar, that’s nine hundred and sixty cigars. I won’t
      smoke dirty pipes like Stubb, but I like cigars, and here’s nine
      hundred and sixty of them; so here goes Flask aloft to spy ’em out.”
      
      “Shall I call that wise or foolish, now; if it be really wise it has a
      foolish look to it; yet, if it be really foolish, then has it a sort of
      wiseish look to it. But, avast; here comes our old Manxman—the old
      hearse-driver, he must have been, that is, before he took to the sea.
      He luffs up before the doubloon; halloa, and goes round on the other
      side of the mast; why, there’s a horse-shoe nailed on that side; and
      now he’s back again; what does that mean? Hark! he’s muttering—voice
      like an old worn-out coffee-mill. Prick ears, and listen!”
      
      “If the White Whale be raised, it must be in a month and a day, when
      the sun stands in some one of these signs. I’ve studied signs, and know
      their marks; they were taught me two score years ago, by the old witch
      in Copenhagen. Now, in what sign will the sun then be? The horse-shoe
      sign; for there it is, right opposite the gold. And what’s the
      horse-shoe sign? The lion is the horse-shoe sign—the roaring and
      devouring lion. Ship, old ship! my old head shakes to think of thee.”
      
      “There’s another rendering now; but still one text. All sorts of men in
      one kind of world, you see. Dodge again! here comes Queequeg—all
      tattooing—looks like the signs of the Zodiac himself. What says the
      Cannibal? As I live he’s comparing notes; looking at his thigh bone;
      thinks the sun is in the thigh, or in the calf, or in the bowels, I
      suppose, as the old women talk Surgeon’s Astronomy in the back country.
      And by Jove, he’s found something there in the vicinity of his thigh—I
      guess it’s Sagittarius, or the Archer. No: he don’t know what to make
      of the doubloon; he takes it for an old button off some king’s
      trowsers. But, aside again! here comes that ghost-devil, Fedallah; tail
      coiled out of sight as usual, oakum in the toes of his pumps as usual.
      What does he say, with that look of his? Ah, only makes a sign to the
      sign and bows himself; there is a sun on the coin—fire worshipper,
      depend upon it. Ho! more and more. This way comes Pip—poor boy! would
      he had died, or I; he’s half horrible to me. He too has been watching
      all of these interpreters—myself included—and look now, he comes to
      read, with that unearthly idiot face. Stand away again and hear him.
      Hark!”
      
      “I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.”
      
      “Upon my soul, he’s been studying Murray’s Grammar! Improving his mind,
      poor fellow! But what’s that he says now—hist!”
      
      “I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.”
      
      “Why, he’s getting it by heart—hist! again.”
      
      “I look, you look, he looks; we look, ye look, they look.”
      
      “Well, that’s funny.”
      
      “And I, you, and he; and we, ye, and they, are all bats; and I’m a
      crow, especially when I stand a’top of this pine tree here. Caw! caw!
      caw! caw! caw! caw! Ain’t I a crow? And where’s the scare-crow? There
      he stands; two bones stuck into a pair of old trowsers, and two more
      poked into the sleeves of an old jacket.”
      
      “Wonder if he means me?—complimentary!—poor lad!—I could go hang
      myself. Any way, for the present, I’ll quit Pip’s vicinity. I can stand
      the rest, for they have plain wits; but he’s too crazy-witty for my
      sanity. So, so, I leave him muttering.”
      
      “Here’s the ship’s navel, this doubloon here, and they are all on fire
      to unscrew it. But, unscrew your navel, and what’s the consequence?
      Then again, if it stays here, that is ugly, too, for when aught’s
      nailed to the mast it’s a sign that things grow desperate. Ha, ha! old
      Ahab! the White Whale; he’ll nail ye! This is a pine tree. My father,
      in old Tolland county, cut down a pine tree once, and found a silver
      ring grown over in it; some old darkey’s wedding ring. How did it get
      there? And so they’ll say in the resurrection, when they come to fish
      up this old mast, and find a doubloon lodged in it, with bedded oysters
      for the shaggy bark. Oh, the gold! the precious, precious, gold! the
      green miser’ll hoard ye soon! Hish! hish! God goes ’mong the worlds
      blackberrying. Cook! ho, cook! and cook us! Jenny! hey, hey, hey, hey,
      hey, Jenny, Jenny! and get your hoe-cake done!”
      
      
      CHAPTER 100. Leg and Arm.
      
      The Pequod, of Nantucket, Meets the Samuel Enderby, of London.
      
      “Ship, ahoy! Hast seen the White Whale?”
      
      So cried Ahab, once more hailing a ship showing English colours,
      bearing down under the stern. Trumpet to mouth, the old man was
      standing in his hoisted quarter-boat, his ivory leg plainly revealed to
      the stranger captain, who was carelessly reclining in his own boat’s
      bow. He was a darkly-tanned, burly, good-natured, fine-looking man, of
      sixty or thereabouts, dressed in a spacious roundabout, that hung round
      him in festoons of blue pilot-cloth; and one empty arm of this jacket
      streamed behind him like the broidered arm of a hussar’s surcoat.
      
      “Hast seen the White Whale?”
      
      “See you this?” and withdrawing it from the folds that had hidden it,
      he held up a white arm of sperm whale bone, terminating in a wooden
      head like a mallet.
      
      “Man my boat!” cried Ahab, impetuously, and tossing about the oars near
      him—“Stand by to lower!”
      
      In less than a minute, without quitting his little craft, he and his
      crew were dropped to the water, and were soon alongside of the
      stranger. But here a curious difficulty presented itself. In the
      excitement of the moment, Ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his
      leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his
      own, and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical
      contrivance peculiar to the Pequod, and a thing not to be rigged and
      shipped in any other vessel at a moment’s warning. Now, it is no very
      easy matter for anybody—except those who are almost hourly used to it,
      like whalemen—to clamber up a ship’s side from a boat on the open sea;
      for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks,
      and then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson. So,
      deprived of one leg, and the strange ship of course being altogether
      unsupplied with the kindly invention, Ahab now found himself abjectly
      reduced to a clumsy landsman again; hopelessly eyeing the uncertain
      changeful height he could hardly hope to attain.
      
      It has before been hinted, perhaps, that every little untoward
      circumstance that befell him, and which indirectly sprang from his
      luckless mishap, almost invariably irritated or exasperated Ahab. And
      in the present instance, all this was heightened by the sight of the
      two officers of the strange ship, leaning over the side, by the
      perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there, and swinging towards him a
      pair of tastefully-ornamented man-ropes; for at first they did not seem
      to bethink them that a one-legged man must be too much of a cripple to
      use their sea bannisters. But this awkwardness only lasted a minute,
      because the strange captain, observing at a glance how affairs stood,
      cried out, “I see, I see!—avast heaving there! Jump, boys, and swing
      over the cutting-tackle.”
      
      As good luck would have it, they had had a whale alongside a day or two
      previous, and the great tackles were still aloft, and the massive
      curved blubber-hook, now clean and dry, was still attached to the end.
      This was quickly lowered to Ahab, who at once comprehending it all,
      slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook (it was like sitting
      in the fluke of an anchor, or the crotch of an apple tree), and then
      giving the word, held himself fast, and at the same time also helped to
      hoist his own weight, by pulling hand-over-hand upon one of the running
      parts of the tackle. Soon he was carefully swung inside the high
      bulwarks, and gently landed upon the capstan head. With his ivory arm
      frankly thrust forth in welcome, the other captain advanced, and Ahab,
      putting out his ivory leg, and crossing the ivory arm (like two
      sword-fish blades) cried out in his walrus way, “Aye, aye, hearty! let
      us shake bones together!—an arm and a leg!—an arm that never can
      shrink, d’ye see; and a leg that never can run. Where did’st thou see
      the White Whale?—how long ago?”
      
      “The White Whale,” said the Englishman, pointing his ivory arm towards
      the East, and taking a rueful sight along it, as if it had been a
      telescope; “there I saw him, on the Line, last season.”
      
      “And he took that arm off, did he?” asked Ahab, now sliding down from
      the capstan, and resting on the Englishman’s shoulder, as he did so.
      
      “Aye, he was the cause of it, at least; and that leg, too?”
      
      “Spin me the yarn,” said Ahab; “how was it?”
      
      “It was the first time in my life that I ever cruised on the Line,”
      began the Englishman. “I was ignorant of the White Whale at that time.
      Well, one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales, and my boat
      fastened to one of them; a regular circus horse he was, too, that went
      milling and milling round so, that my boat’s crew could only trim dish,
      by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale. Presently up breaches
      from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale, with a milky-white
      head and hump, all crows’ feet and wrinkles.”
      
      “It was he, it was he!” cried Ahab, suddenly letting out his suspended
      breath.
      
      “And harpoons sticking in near his starboard fin.”
      
      “Aye, aye—they were mine—_my_ irons,” cried Ahab, exultingly—“but on!”
      
      “Give me a chance, then,” said the Englishman, good-humoredly. “Well,
      this old great-grandfather, with the white head and hump, runs all
      afoam into the pod, and goes to snapping furiously at my fast-line!
      
      “Aye, I see!—wanted to part it; free the fast-fish—an old trick—I know
      him.”
      
      “How it was exactly,” continued the one-armed commander, “I do not
      know; but in biting the line, it got foul of his teeth, caught there
      somehow; but we didn’t know it then; so that when we afterwards pulled
      on the line, bounce we came plump on to his hump! instead of the other
      whale’s; that went off to windward, all fluking. Seeing how matters
      stood, and what a noble great whale it was—the noblest and biggest I
      ever saw, sir, in my life—I resolved to capture him, spite of the
      boiling rage he seemed to be in. And thinking the hap-hazard line would
      get loose, or the tooth it was tangled to might draw (for I have a
      devil of a boat’s crew for a pull on a whale-line); seeing all this, I
      say, I jumped into my first mate’s boat—Mr. Mounttop’s here (by the
      way, Captain—Mounttop; Mounttop—the captain);—as I was saying, I jumped
      into Mounttop’s boat, which, d’ye see, was gunwale and gunwale with
      mine, then; and snatching the first harpoon, let this old
      great-grandfather have it. But, Lord, look you, sir—hearts and souls
      alive, man—the next instant, in a jiff, I was blind as a bat—both eyes
      out—all befogged and bedeadened with black foam—the whale’s tail
      looming straight up out of it, perpendicular in the air, like a marble
      steeple. No use sterning all, then; but as I was groping at midday,
      with a blinding sun, all crown-jewels; as I was groping, I say, after
      the second iron, to toss it overboard—down comes the tail like a Lima
      tower, cutting my boat in two, leaving each half in splinters; and,
      flukes first, the white hump backed through the wreck, as though it was
      all chips. We all struck out. To escape his terrible flailings, I
      seized hold of my harpoon-pole sticking in him, and for a moment clung
      to that like a sucking fish. But a combing sea dashed me off, and at
      the same instant, the fish, taking one good dart forwards, went down
      like a flash; and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near
      me caught me here” (clapping his hand just below his shoulder); “yes,
      caught me just here, I say, and bore me down to Hell’s flames, I was
      thinking; when, when, all of a sudden, thank the good God, the barb
      ript its way along the flesh—clear along the whole length of my
      arm—came out nigh my wrist, and up I floated;—and that gentleman there
      will tell you the rest (by the way, captain—Dr. Bunger, ship’s surgeon:
      Bunger, my lad,—the captain). Now, Bunger boy, spin your part of the
      yarn.”
      
      The professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out, had been all
      the time standing near them, with nothing specific visible, to denote
      his gentlemanly rank on board. His face was an exceedingly round but
      sober one; he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt, and
      patched trowsers; and had thus far been dividing his attention between
      a marlingspike he held in one hand, and a pill-box held in the other,
      occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two
      crippled captains. But, at his superior’s introduction of him to Ahab,
      he politely bowed, and straightway went on to do his captain’s bidding.
      
      “It was a shocking bad wound,” began the whale-surgeon; “and, taking my
      advice, Captain Boomer here, stood our old Sammy—”
      
      “Samuel Enderby is the name of my ship,” interrupted the one-armed
      captain, addressing Ahab; “go on, boy.”
      
      “Stood our old Sammy off to the northward, to get out of the blazing
      hot weather there on the Line. But it was no use—I did all I could; sat
      up with him nights; was very severe with him in the matter of diet—”
      
      “Oh, very severe!” chimed in the patient himself; then suddenly
      altering his voice, “Drinking hot rum toddies with me every night, till
      he couldn’t see to put on the bandages; and sending me to bed, half
      seas over, about three o’clock in the morning. Oh, ye stars! he sat up
      with me indeed, and was very severe in my diet. Oh! a great watcher,
      and very dietetically severe, is Dr. Bunger. (Bunger, you dog, laugh
      out! why don’t ye? You know you’re a precious jolly rascal.) But, heave
      ahead, boy, I’d rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other
      man.”
      
      “My captain, you must have ere this perceived, respected sir”—said the
      imperturbable godly-looking Bunger, slightly bowing to Ahab—“is apt to
      be facetious at times; he spins us many clever things of that sort. But
      I may as well say—en passant, as the French remark—that I myself—that
      is to say, Jack Bunger, late of the reverend clergy—am a strict total
      abstinence man; I never drink—”
      
      “Water!” cried the captain; “he never drinks it; it’s a sort of fits to
      him; fresh water throws him into the hydrophobia; but go on—go on with
      the arm story.”
      
      “Yes, I may as well,” said the surgeon, coolly. “I was about observing,
      sir, before Captain Boomer’s facetious interruption, that spite of my
      best and severest endeavors, the wound kept getting worse and worse;
      the truth was, sir, it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw;
      more than two feet and several inches long. I measured it with the lead
      line. In short, it grew black; I knew what was threatened, and off it
      came. But I had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there; that thing is
      against all rule”—pointing at it with the marlingspike—“that is the
      captain’s work, not mine; he ordered the carpenter to make it; he had
      that club-hammer there put to the end, to knock some one’s brains out
      with, I suppose, as he tried mine once. He flies into diabolical
      passions sometimes. Do ye see this dent, sir”—removing his hat, and
      brushing aside his hair, and exposing a bowl-like cavity in his skull,
      but which bore not the slightest scarry trace, or any token of ever
      having been a wound—“Well, the captain there will tell you how that
      came here; he knows.”
      
      “No, I don’t,” said the captain, “but his mother did; he was born with
      it. Oh, you solemn rogue, you—you Bunger! was there ever such another
      Bunger in the watery world? Bunger, when you die, you ought to die in
      pickle, you dog; you should be preserved to future ages, you rascal.”
      
      “What became of the White Whale?” now cried Ahab, who thus far had been
      impatiently listening to this by-play between the two Englishmen.
      
      “Oh!” cried the one-armed captain, “oh, yes! Well; after he sounded, we
      didn’t see him again for some time; in fact, as I before hinted, I
      didn’t then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick,
      till some time afterwards, when coming back to the Line, we heard about
      Moby Dick—as some call him—and then I knew it was he.”
      
      “Did’st thou cross his wake again?”
      
      “Twice.”
      
      “But could not fasten?”
      
      “Didn’t want to try to: ain’t one limb enough? What should I do without
      this other arm? And I’m thinking Moby Dick doesn’t bite so much as he
      swallows.”
      
      “Well, then,” interrupted Bunger, “give him your left arm for bait to
      get the right. Do you know, gentlemen”—very gravely and mathematically
      bowing to each Captain in succession—“Do you know, gentlemen, that the
      digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by Divine
      Providence, that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest
      even a man’s arm? And he knows it too. So that what you take for the
      White Whale’s malice is only his awkwardness. For he never means to
      swallow a single limb; he only thinks to terrify by feints. But
      sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow, formerly a patient of
      mine in Ceylon, that making believe swallow jack-knives, once upon a
      time let one drop into him in good earnest, and there it stayed for a
      twelvemonth or more; when I gave him an emetic, and he heaved it up in
      small tacks, d’ye see. No possible way for him to digest that
      jack-knife, and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system.
      Yes, Captain Boomer, if you are quick enough about it, and have a mind
      to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial
      to the other, why in that case the arm is yours; only let the whale
      have another chance at you shortly, that’s all.”
      
      “No, thank ye, Bunger,” said the English Captain, “he’s welcome to the
      arm he has, since I can’t help it, and didn’t know him then; but not to
      another one. No more White Whales for me; I’ve lowered for him once,
      and that has satisfied me. There would be great glory in killing him, I
      know that; and there is a ship-load of precious sperm in him, but, hark
      ye, he’s best let alone; don’t you think so, Captain?”—glancing at the
      ivory leg.
      
      “He is. But he will still be hunted, for all that. What is best let
      alone, that accursed thing is not always what least allures. He’s all a
      magnet! How long since thou saw’st him last? Which way heading?”
      
      “Bless my soul, and curse the foul fiend’s,” cried Bunger, stoopingly
      walking round Ahab, and like a dog, strangely snuffing; “this man’s
      blood—bring the thermometer!—it’s at the boiling point!—his pulse makes
      these planks beat!—sir!”—taking a lancet from his pocket, and drawing
      near to Ahab’s arm.
      
      “Avast!” roared Ahab, dashing him against the bulwarks—“Man the boat!
      Which way heading?”
      
      “Good God!” cried the English Captain, to whom the question was put.
      “What’s the matter? He was heading east, I think.—Is your Captain
      crazy?” whispering Fedallah.
      
      But Fedallah, putting a finger on his lip, slid over the bulwarks to
      take the boat’s steering oar, and Ahab, swinging the cutting-tackle
      towards him, commanded the ship’s sailors to stand by to lower.
      
      In a moment he was standing in the boat’s stern, and the Manilla men
      were springing to their oars. In vain the English Captain hailed him.
      With back to the stranger ship, and face set like a flint to his own,
      Ahab stood upright till alongside of the Pequod.
      
      
      CHAPTER 101. The Decanter.
      
      Ere the English ship fades from sight, be it set down here, that she
      hailed from London, and was named after the late Samuel Enderby,
      merchant of that city, the original of the famous whaling house of
      Enderby & Sons; a house which in my poor whaleman’s opinion, comes not
      far behind the united royal houses of the Tudors and Bourbons, in point
      of real historical interest. How long, prior to the year of our Lord
      1775, this great whaling house was in existence, my numerous
      fish-documents do not make plain; but in that year (1775) it fitted out
      the first English ships that ever regularly hunted the Sperm Whale;
      though for some score of years previous (ever since 1726) our valiant
      Coffins and Maceys of Nantucket and the Vineyard had in large fleets
      pursued that Leviathan, but only in the North and South Atlantic: not
      elsewhere. Be it distinctly recorded here, that the Nantucketers were
      the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great Sperm
      Whale; and that for half a century they were the only people of the
      whole globe who so harpooned him.
      
      In 1778, a fine ship, the Amelia, fitted out for the express purpose,
      and at the sole charge of the vigorous Enderbys, boldly rounded Cape
      Horn, and was the first among the nations to lower a whale-boat of any
      sort in the great South Sea. The voyage was a skilful and lucky one;
      and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm,
      the Amelia’s example was soon followed by other ships, English and
      American, and thus the vast Sperm Whale grounds of the Pacific were
      thrown open. But not content with this good deed, the indefatigable
      house again bestirred itself: Samuel and all his Sons—how many, their
      mother only knows—and under their immediate auspices, and partly, I
      think, at their expense, the British government was induced to send the
      sloop-of-war Rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the South
      Sea. Commanded by a naval Post-Captain, the Rattler made a rattling
      voyage of it, and did some service; how much does not appear. But this
      is not all. In 1819, the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship
      of their own, to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of Japan.
      That ship—well called the “Syren”—made a noble experimental cruise; and
      it was thus that the great Japanese Whaling Ground first became
      generally known. The Syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a
      Captain Coffin, a Nantucketer.
      
      All honor to the Enderbies, therefore, whose house, I think, exists to
      the present day; though doubtless the original Samuel must long ago
      have slipped his cable for the great South Sea of the other world.
      
      The ship named after him was worthy of the honor, being a very fast
      sailer and a noble craft every way. I boarded her once at midnight
      somewhere off the Patagonian coast, and drank good flip down in the
      forecastle. It was a fine gam we had, and they were all trumps—every
      soul on board. A short life to them, and a jolly death. And that fine
      gam I had—long, very long after old Ahab touched her planks with his
      ivory heel—it minds me of the noble, solid, Saxon hospitality of that
      ship; and may my parson forget me, and the devil remember me, if I ever
      lose sight of it. Flip? Did I say we had flip? Yes, and we flipped it
      at the rate of ten gallons the hour; and when the squall came (for it’s
      squally off there by Patagonia), and all hands—visitors and all—were
      called to reef topsails, we were so top-heavy that we had to swing each
      other aloft in bowlines; and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our
      jackets into the sails, so that we hung there, reefed fast in the
      howling gale, a warning example to all drunken tars. However, the masts
      did not go overboard; and by and by we scrambled down, so sober, that
      we had to pass the flip again, though the savage salt spray bursting
      down the forecastle scuttle, rather too much diluted and pickled it to
      my taste.
      
      The beef was fine—tough, but with body in it. They said it was
      bull-beef; others, that it was dromedary beef; but I do not know, for
      certain, how that was. They had dumplings too; small, but substantial,
      symmetrically globular, and indestructible dumplings. I fancied that
      you could feel them, and roll them about in you after they were
      swallowed. If you stooped over too far forward, you risked their
      pitching out of you like billiard-balls. The bread—but that couldn’t be
      helped; besides, it was an anti-scorbutic; in short, the bread
      contained the only fresh fare they had. But the forecastle was not very
      light, and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you
      ate it. But all in all, taking her from truck to helm, considering the
      dimensions of the cook’s boilers, including his own live parchment
      boilers; fore and aft, I say, the Samuel Enderby was a jolly ship; of
      good fare and plenty; fine flip and strong; crack fellows all, and
      capital from boot heels to hat-band.
      
      But why was it, think ye, that the Samuel Enderby, and some other
      English whalers I know of—not all though—were such famous, hospitable
      ships; that passed round the beef, and the bread, and the can, and the
      joke; and were not soon weary of eating, and drinking, and laughing? I
      will tell you. The abounding good cheer of these English whalers is
      matter for historical research. Nor have I been at all sparing of
      historical whale research, when it has seemed needed.
      
      The English were preceded in the whale fishery by the Hollanders,
      Zealanders, and Danes; from whom they derived many terms still extant
      in the fishery; and what is yet more, their fat old fashions, touching
      plenty to eat and drink. For, as a general thing, the English
      merchant-ship scrimps her crew; but not so the English whaler. Hence,
      in the English, this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and
      natural, but incidental and particular; and, therefore, must have some
      special origin, which is here pointed out, and will be still further
      elucidated.
      
      During my researches in the Leviathanic histories, I stumbled upon an
      ancient Dutch volume, which, by the musty whaling smell of it, I knew
      must be about whalers. The title was, “Dan Coopman,” wherefore I
      concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some Amsterdam
      cooper in the fishery, as every whale ship must carry its cooper. I was
      reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one
      “Fitz Swackhammer.” But my friend Dr. Snodhead, a very learned man,
      professor of Low Dutch and High German in the college of Santa Claus
      and St. Pott’s, to whom I handed the work for translation, giving him a
      box of sperm candles for his trouble—this same Dr. Snodhead, so soon as
      he spied the book, assured me that “Dan Coopman” did not mean “The
      Cooper,” but “The Merchant.” In short, this ancient and learned Low
      Dutch book treated of the commerce of Holland; and, among other
      subjects, contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery.
      And in this chapter it was, headed, “Smeer,” or “Fat,” that I found a
      long detailed list of the outfits for the larders and cellars of 180
      sail of Dutch whalemen; from which list, as translated by Dr. Snodhead,
      I transcribe the following:
      
      400,000 lbs. of beef. 60,000 lbs. Friesland pork. 150,000 lbs. of stock
      fish. 550,000 lbs. of biscuit. 72,000 lbs. of soft bread. 2,800 firkins
      of butter. 20,000 lbs. Texel & Leyden cheese. 144,000 lbs. cheese
      (probably an inferior article). 550 ankers of Geneva. 10,800 barrels of
      beer.
      
      Most statistical tables are parchingly dry in the reading; not so in
      the present case, however, where the reader is flooded with whole
      pipes, barrels, quarts, and gills of good gin and good cheer.
      
      At the time, I devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this
      beer, beef, and bread, during which many profound thoughts were
      incidentally suggested to me, capable of a transcendental and Platonic
      application; and, furthermore, I compiled supplementary tables of my
      own, touching the probable quantity of stock-fish, etc., consumed by
      every Low Dutch harpooneer in that ancient Greenland and Spitzbergen
      whale fishery. In the first place, the amount of butter, and Texel and
      Leyden cheese consumed, seems amazing. I impute it, though, to their
      naturally unctuous natures, being rendered still more unctuous by the
      nature of their vocation, and especially by their pursuing their game
      in those frigid Polar Seas, on the very coasts of that Esquimaux
      country where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of
      train oil.
      
      The quantity of beer, too, is very large, 10,800 barrels. Now, as those
      polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that
      climate, so that the whole cruise of one of these Dutch whalemen,
      including the short voyage to and from the Spitzbergen sea, did not
      much exceed three months, say, and reckoning 30 men to each of their
      fleet of 180 sail, we have 5,400 Low Dutch seamen in all; therefore, I
      say, we have precisely two barrels of beer per man, for a twelve weeks’
      allowance, exclusive of his fair proportion of that 550 ankers of gin.
      Now, whether these gin and beer harpooneers, so fuddled as one might
      fancy them to have been, were the right sort of men to stand up in a
      boat’s head, and take good aim at flying whales; this would seem
      somewhat improbable. Yet they did aim at them, and hit them too. But
      this was very far North, be it remembered, where beer agrees well with
      the constitution; upon the Equator, in our southern fishery, beer would
      be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the mast-head and boozy in his
      boat; and grievous loss might ensue to Nantucket and New Bedford.
      
      But no more; enough has been said to show that the old Dutch whalers of
      two or three centuries ago were high livers; and that the English
      whalers have not neglected so excellent an example. For, say they, when
      cruising in an empty ship, if you can get nothing better out of the
      world, get a good dinner out of it, at least. And this empties the
      decanter.
      
      
      CHAPTER 102. A Bower in the Arsacides.
      
      Hitherto, in descriptively treating of the Sperm Whale, I have chiefly
      dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect; or separately and in detail
      upon some few interior structural features. But to a large and thorough
      sweeping comprehension of him, it behooves me now to unbutton him still
      further, and untagging the points of his hose, unbuckling his garters,
      and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost
      bones, set him before you in his ultimatum; that is to say, in his
      unconditional skeleton.
      
      But how now, Ishmael? How is it, that you, a mere oarsman in the
      fishery, pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the
      whale? Did erudite Stubb, mounted upon your capstan, deliver lectures
      on the anatomy of the Cetacea; and by help of the windlass, hold up a
      specimen rib for exhibition? Explain thyself, Ishmael. Can you land a
      full-grown whale on your deck for examination, as a cook dishes a
      roast-pig? Surely not. A veritable witness have you hitherto been,
      Ishmael; but have a care how you seize the privilege of Jonah alone;
      the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams; the rafters,
      ridge-pole, sleepers, and under-pinnings, making up the frame-work of
      leviathan; and belike of the tallow-vats, dairy-rooms, butteries, and
      cheeseries in his bowels.
      
      I confess, that since Jonah, few whalemen have penetrated very far
      beneath the skin of the adult whale; nevertheless, I have been blessed
      with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature. In a ship I belonged
      to, a small cub Sperm Whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his
      poke or bag, to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons, and for the
      heads of the lances. Think you I let that chance go, without using my
      boat-hatchet and jack-knife, and breaking the seal and reading all the
      contents of that young cub?
      
      And as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their
      gigantic, full grown development, for that rare knowledge I am indebted
      to my late royal friend Tranquo, king of Tranque, one of the Arsacides.
      For being at Tranque, years ago, when attached to the trading-ship Dey
      of Algiers, I was invited to spend part of the Arsacidean holidays with
      the lord of Tranque, at his retired palm villa at Pupella; a sea-side
      glen not very far distant from what our sailors called Bamboo-Town, his
      capital.
      
      Among many other fine qualities, my royal friend Tranquo, being gifted
      with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu, had brought
      together in Pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his
      people could invent; chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices,
      chiselled shells, inlaid spears, costly paddles, aromatic canoes; and
      all these distributed among whatever natural wonders, the
      wonder-freighted, tribute-rendering waves had cast upon his shores.
      
      Chief among these latter was a great Sperm Whale, which, after an
      unusually long raging gale, had been found dead and stranded, with his
      head against a cocoa-nut tree, whose plumage-like, tufted droopings
      seemed his verdant jet. When the vast body had at last been stripped of
      its fathom-deep enfoldings, and the bones become dust dry in the sun,
      then the skeleton was carefully transported up the Pupella glen, where
      a grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it.
      
      The ribs were hung with trophies; the vertebræ were carved with
      Arsacidean annals, in strange hieroglyphics; in the skull, the priests
      kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame, so that the mystic head again
      sent forth its vapory spout; while, suspended from a bough, the
      terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees, like the hair-hung
      sword that so affrighted Damocles.
      
      It was a wondrous sight. The wood was green as mosses of the Icy Glen;
      the trees stood high and haughty, feeling their living sap; the
      industrious earth beneath was as a weaver’s loom, with a gorgeous
      carpet on it, whereof the ground-vine tendrils formed the warp and
      woof, and the living flowers the figures. All the trees, with all their
      laden branches; all the shrubs, and ferns, and grasses; the
      message-carrying air; all these unceasingly were active. Through the
      lacings of the leaves, the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving
      the unwearied verdure. Oh, busy weaver! unseen weaver!—pause!—one
      word!—whither flows the fabric? what palace may it deck? wherefore all
      these ceaseless toilings? Speak, weaver!—stay thy hand!—but one single
      word with thee! Nay—the shuttle flies—the figures float from forth the
      loom; the freshet-rushing carpet for ever slides away. The weaver-god,
      he weaves; and by that weaving is he deafened, that he hears no mortal
      voice; and by that humming, we, too, who look on the loom are deafened;
      and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak
      through it. For even so it is in all material factories. The spoken
      words that are inaudible among the flying spindles; those same words
      are plainly heard without the walls, bursting from the opened
      casements. Thereby have villainies been detected. Ah, mortal! then, be
      heedful; for so, in all this din of the great world’s loom, thy
      subtlest thinkings may be overheard afar.
      
      Now, amid the green, life-restless loom of that Arsacidean wood, the
      great, white, worshipped skeleton lay lounging—a gigantic idler! Yet,
      as the ever-woven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around
      him, the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver; himself all woven over
      with the vines; every month assuming greener, fresher verdure; but
      himself a skeleton. Life folded Death; Death trellised Life; the grim
      god wived with youthful Life, and begat him curly-headed glories.
      
      Now, when with royal Tranquo I visited this wondrous whale, and saw the
      skull an altar, and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real
      jet had issued, I marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an
      object of vertu. He laughed. But more I marvelled that the priests
      should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine. To and fro I paced
      before this skeleton—brushed the vines aside—broke through the ribs—and
      with a ball of Arsacidean twine, wandered, eddied long amid its many
      winding, shaded colonnades and arbours. But soon my line was out; and
      following it back, I emerged from the opening where I entered. I saw no
      living thing within; naught was there but bones.
      
      Cutting me a green measuring-rod, I once more dived within the
      skeleton. From their arrow-slit in the skull, the priests perceived me
      taking the altitude of the final rib, “How now!” they shouted; “Dar’st
      thou measure this our god! That’s for us.” “Aye, priests—well, how long
      do ye make him, then?” But hereupon a fierce contest rose among them,
      concerning feet and inches; they cracked each other’s sconces with
      their yard-sticks—the great skull echoed—and seizing that lucky chance,
      I quickly concluded my own admeasurements.
      
      These admeasurements I now propose to set before you. But first, be it
      recorded, that, in this matter, I am not free to utter any fancied
      measurement I please. Because there are skeleton authorities you can
      refer to, to test my accuracy. There is a Leviathanic Museum, they tell
      me, in Hull, England, one of the whaling ports of that country, where
      they have some fine specimens of fin-backs and other whales. Likewise,
      I have heard that in the museum of Manchester, in New Hampshire, they
      have what the proprietors call “the only perfect specimen of a
      Greenland or River Whale in the United States.” Moreover, at a place in
      Yorkshire, England, Burton Constable by name, a certain Sir Clifford
      Constable has in his possession the skeleton of a Sperm Whale, but of
      moderate size, by no means of the full-grown magnitude of my friend
      King Tranquo’s.
      
      In both cases, the stranded whales to which these two skeletons
      belonged, were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar
      grounds. King Tranquo seizing his because he wanted it; and Sir
      Clifford, because he was lord of the seignories of those parts. Sir
      Clifford’s whale has been articulated throughout; so that, like a great
      chest of drawers, you can open and shut him, in all his bony
      cavities—spread out his ribs like a gigantic fan—and swing all day upon
      his lower jaw. Locks are to be put upon some of his trap-doors and
      shutters; and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of
      keys at his side. Sir Clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep
      at the whispering gallery in the spinal column; threepence to hear the
      echo in the hollow of his cerebellum; and sixpence for the unrivalled
      view from his forehead.
      
      The skeleton dimensions I shall now proceed to set down are copied
      verbatim from my right arm, where I had them tattooed; as in my wild
      wanderings at that period, there was no other secure way of preserving
      such valuable statistics. But as I was crowded for space, and wished
      the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem I was then
      composing—at least, what untattooed parts might remain—I did not
      trouble myself with the odd inches; nor, indeed, should inches at all
      enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale.
      
      
      CHAPTER 103. Measurement of The Whale’s Skeleton.
      
      In the first place, I wish to lay before you a particular, plain
      statement, touching the living bulk of this leviathan, whose skeleton
      we are briefly to exhibit. Such a statement may prove useful here.
      
      According to a careful calculation I have made, and which I partly base
      upon Captain Scoresby’s estimate, of seventy tons for the largest sized
      Greenland whale of sixty feet in length; according to my careful
      calculation, I say, a Sperm Whale of the largest magnitude, between
      eighty-five and ninety feet in length, and something less than forty
      feet in its fullest circumference, such a whale will weigh at least
      ninety tons; so that, reckoning thirteen men to a ton, he would
      considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one
      thousand one hundred inhabitants.
      
      Think you not then that brains, like yoked cattle, should be put to
      this leviathan, to make him at all budge to any landsman’s imagination?
      
      Having already in various ways put before you his skull, spout-hole,
      jaw, teeth, tail, forehead, fins, and divers other parts, I shall now
      simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his
      unobstructed bones. But as the colossal skull embraces so very large a
      proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton; as it is by far the
      most complicated part; and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it
      in this chapter, you must not fail to carry it in your mind, or under
      your arm, as we proceed, otherwise you will not gain a complete notion
      of the general structure we are about to view.
      
      In length, the Sperm Whale’s skeleton at Tranque measured seventy-two
      feet; so that when fully invested and extended in life, he must have
      been ninety feet long; for in the whale, the skeleton loses about one
      fifth in length compared with the living body. Of this seventy-two
      feet, his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet, leaving some fifty
      feet of plain back-bone. Attached to this back-bone, for something less
      than a third of its length, was the mighty circular basket of ribs
      which once enclosed his vitals.
      
      To me this vast ivory-ribbed chest, with the long, unrelieved spine,
      extending far away from it in a straight line, not a little resembled
      the hull of a great ship new-laid upon the stocks, when only some
      twenty of her naked bow-ribs are inserted, and the keel is otherwise,
      for the time, but a long, disconnected timber.
      
      The ribs were ten on a side. The first, to begin from the neck, was
      nearly six feet long; the second, third, and fourth were each
      successively longer, till you came to the climax of the fifth, or one
      of the middle ribs, which measured eight feet and some inches. From
      that part, the remaining ribs diminished, till the tenth and last only
      spanned five feet and some inches. In general thickness, they all bore
      a seemly correspondence to their length. The middle ribs were the most
      arched. In some of the Arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay
      footpath bridges over small streams.
      
      In considering these ribs, I could not but be struck anew with the
      circumstance, so variously repeated in this book, that the skeleton of
      the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form. The largest of
      the Tranque ribs, one of the middle ones, occupied that part of the
      fish which, in life, is greatest in depth. Now, the greatest depth of
      the invested body of this particular whale must have been at least
      sixteen feet; whereas, the corresponding rib measured but little more
      than eight feet. So that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion
      of the living magnitude of that part. Besides, for some way, where I
      now saw but a naked spine, all that had been once wrapped round with
      tons of added bulk in flesh, muscle, blood, and bowels. Still more, for
      the ample fins, I here saw but a few disordered joints; and in place of
      the weighty and majestic, but boneless flukes, an utter blank!
      
      How vain and foolish, then, thought I, for timid untravelled man to try
      to comprehend aright this wondrous whale, by merely poring over his
      dead attenuated skeleton, stretched in this peaceful wood. No. Only in
      the heart of quickest perils; only when within the eddyings of his
      angry flukes; only on the profound unbounded sea, can the fully
      invested whale be truly and livingly found out.
      
      But the spine. For that, the best way we can consider it is, with a
      crane, to pile its bones high up on end. No speedy enterprise. But now
      it’s done, it looks much like Pompey’s Pillar.
      
      There are forty and odd vertebræ in all, which in the skeleton are not
      locked together. They mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a
      Gothic spire, forming solid courses of heavy masonry. The largest, a
      middle one, is in width something less than three feet, and in depth
      more than four. The smallest, where the spine tapers away into the
      tail, is only two inches in width, and looks something like a white
      billiard-ball. I was told that there were still smaller ones, but they
      had been lost by some little cannibal urchins, the priest’s children,
      who had stolen them to play marbles with. Thus we see how that the
      spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into
      simple child’s play.
      
      
      CHAPTER 104. The Fossil Whale.
      
      From his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon
      to enlarge, amplify, and generally expatiate. Would you, you could not
      compress him. By good rights he should only be treated of in imperial
      folio. Not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail, and
      the yards he measures about the waist; only think of the gigantic
      involutions of his intestines, where they lie in him like great cables
      and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlop-deck of a
      line-of-battle-ship.
      
      Since I have undertaken to manhandle this Leviathan, it behooves me to
      approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise; not
      overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood, and spinning him
      out to the uttermost coil of his bowels. Having already described him
      in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities, it now
      remains to magnify him in an archæological, fossiliferous, and
      antediluvian point of view. Applied to any other creature than the
      Leviathan—to an ant or a flea—such portly terms might justly be deemed
      unwarrantably grandiloquent. But when Leviathan is the text, the case
      is altered. Fain am I to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest
      words of the dictionary. And here be it said, that whenever it has been
      convenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations, I have
      invariably used a huge quarto edition of Johnson, expressly purchased
      for that purpose; because that famous lexicographer’s uncommon personal
      bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author
      like me.
      
      One often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject,
      though it may seem but an ordinary one. How, then, with me, writing of
      this Leviathan? Unconsciously my chirography expands into placard
      capitals. Give me a condor’s quill! Give me Vesuvius’ crater for an
      inkstand! Friends, hold my arms! For in the mere act of penning my
      thoughts of this Leviathan, they weary me, and make me faint with their
      outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep, as if to include the whole
      circle of the sciences, and all the generations of whales, and men, and
      mastodons, past, present, and to come, with all the revolving panoramas
      of empire on earth, and throughout the whole universe, not excluding
      its suburbs. Such, and so magnifying, is the virtue of a large and
      liberal theme! We expand to its bulk. To produce a mighty book, you
      must choose a mighty theme. No great and enduring volume can ever be
      written on the flea, though many there be who have tried it.
      
      Ere entering upon the subject of Fossil Whales, I present my
      credentials as a geologist, by stating that in my miscellaneous time I
      have been a stone-mason, and also a great digger of ditches, canals and
      wells, wine-vaults, cellars, and cisterns of all sorts. Likewise, by
      way of preliminary, I desire to remind the reader, that while in the
      earlier geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now
      almost completely extinct; the subsequent relics discovered in what are
      called the Tertiary formations seem the connecting, or at any rate
      intercepted links, between the antichronical creatures, and those whose
      remote posterity are said to have entered the Ark; all the Fossil
      Whales hitherto discovered belong to the Tertiary period, which is the
      last preceding the superficial formations. And though none of them
      precisely answer to any known species of the present time, they are yet
      sufficiently akin to them in general respects, to justify their taking
      rank as Cetacean fossils.
      
      Detached broken fossils of pre-adamite whales, fragments of their bones
      and skeletons, have within thirty years past, at various intervals,
      been found at the base of the Alps, in Lombardy, in France, in England,
      in Scotland, and in the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.
      Among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull, which in the
      year 1779 was disinterred in the Rue Dauphine in Paris, a short street
      opening almost directly upon the palace of the Tuileries; and bones
      disinterred in excavating the great docks of Antwerp, in Napoleon’s
      time. Cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some
      utterly unknown Leviathanic species.
      
      But by far the most wonderful of all Cetacean relics was the almost
      complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster, found in the year 1842,
      on the plantation of Judge Creagh, in Alabama. The awe-stricken
      credulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the
      fallen angels. The Alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile, and
      bestowed upon it the name of Basilosaurus. But some specimen bones of
      it being taken across the sea to Owen, the English Anatomist, it turned
      out that this alleged reptile was a whale, though of a departed
      species. A significant illustration of the fact, again and again
      repeated in this book, that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but
      little clue to the shape of his fully invested body. So Owen
      rechristened the monster Zeuglodon; and in his paper read before the
      London Geological Society, pronounced it, in substance, one of the most
      extraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have blotted
      out of existence.
      
      When I stand among these mighty Leviathan skeletons, skulls, tusks,
      jaws, ribs, and vertebræ, all characterized by partial resemblances to
      the existing breeds of sea-monsters; but at the same time bearing on
      the other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical
      Leviathans, their incalculable seniors; I am, by a flood, borne back to
      that wondrous period, ere time itself can be said to have begun; for
      time began with man. Here Saturn’s grey chaos rolls over me, and I
      obtain dim, shuddering glimpses into those Polar eternities; when
      wedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the Tropics; and
      in all the 25,000 miles of this world’s circumference, not an
      inhabitable hand’s breadth of land was visible. Then the whole world
      was the whale’s; and, king of creation, he left his wake along the
      present lines of the Andes and the Himmalehs. Who can show a pedigree
      like Leviathan? Ahab’s harpoon had shed older blood than the Pharaoh’s.
      Methuselah seems a school-boy. I look round to shake hands with Shem. I
      am horror-struck at this antemosaic, unsourced existence of the
      unspeakable terrors of the whale, which, having been before all time,
      must needs exist after all humane ages are over.
      
      But not alone has this Leviathan left his pre-adamite traces in the
      stereotype plates of nature, and in limestone and marl bequeathed his
      ancient bust; but upon Egyptian tablets, whose antiquity seems to claim
      for them an almost fossiliferous character, we find the unmistakable
      print of his fin. In an apartment of the great temple of Denderah, some
      fifty years ago, there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a
      sculptured and painted planisphere, abounding in centaurs, griffins,
      and dolphins, similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe
      of the moderns. Gliding among them, old Leviathan swam as of yore; was
      there swimming in that planisphere, centuries before Solomon was
      cradled.
      
      Nor must there be omitted another strange attestation of the antiquity
      of the whale, in his own osseous post-diluvian reality, as set down by
      the venerable John Leo, the old Barbary traveller.
      
      “Not far from the Sea-side, they have a Temple, the Rafters and Beams
      of which are made of Whale-Bones; for Whales of a monstrous size are
      oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore. The Common People imagine,
      that by a secret Power bestowed by God upon the Temple, no Whale can
      pass it without immediate death. But the truth of the Matter is, that
      on either side of the Temple, there are Rocks that shoot two Miles into
      the Sea, and wound the Whales when they light upon ’em. They keep a
      Whale’s Rib of an incredible length for a Miracle, which lying upon the
      Ground with its convex part uppermost, makes an Arch, the Head of which
      cannot be reached by a Man upon a Camel’s Back. This Rib (says John
      Leo) is said to have layn there a hundred Years before I saw it. Their
      Historians affirm, that a Prophet who prophesy’d of Mahomet, came from
      this Temple, and some do not stand to assert, that the Prophet Jonas
      was cast forth by the Whale at the Base of the Temple.”
      
      In this Afric Temple of the Whale I leave you, reader, and if you be a
      Nantucketer, and a whaleman, you will silently worship there.
      
      
      CHAPTER 105. Does the Whale’s Magnitude Diminish?—Will He Perish?
      
      Inasmuch, then, as this Leviathan comes floundering down upon us from
      the head-waters of the Eternities, it may be fitly inquired, whether,
      in the long course of his generations, he has not degenerated from the
      original bulk of his sires.
      
      But upon investigation we find, that not only are the whales of the
      present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are
      found in the Tertiary system (embracing a distinct geological period
      prior to man), but of the whales found in that Tertiary system, those
      belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier
      ones.
      
      Of all the pre-adamite whales yet exhumed, by far the largest is the
      Alabama one mentioned in the last chapter, and that was less than
      seventy feet in length in the skeleton. Whereas, we have already seen,
      that the tape-measure gives seventy-two feet for the skeleton of a
      large sized modern whale. And I have heard, on whalemen’s authority,
      that Sperm Whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the
      time of capture.
      
      But may it not be, that while the whales of the present hour are an
      advance in magnitude upon those of all previous geological periods; may
      it not be, that since Adam’s time they have degenerated?
      
      Assuredly, we must conclude so, if we are to credit the accounts of
      such gentlemen as Pliny, and the ancient naturalists generally. For
      Pliny tells us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk, and
      Aldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in length—Rope
      Walks and Thames Tunnels of Whales! And even in the days of Banks and
      Solander, Cooke’s naturalists, we find a Danish member of the Academy
      of Sciences setting down certain Iceland Whales (reydan-siskur, or
      Wrinkled Bellies) at one hundred and twenty yards; that is, three
      hundred and sixty feet. And Lacépède, the French naturalist, in his
      elaborate history of whales, in the very beginning of his work (page
      3), sets down the Right Whale at one hundred metres, three hundred and
      twenty-eight feet. And this work was published so late as A.D. 1825.
      
      But will any whaleman believe these stories? No. The whale of to-day is
      as big as his ancestors in Pliny’s time. And if ever I go where Pliny
      is, I, a whaleman (more than he was), will make bold to tell him so.
      Because I cannot understand how it is, that while the Egyptian mummies
      that were buried thousands of years before even Pliny was born, do not
      measure so much in their coffins as a modern Kentuckian in his socks;
      and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest
      Egyptian and Nineveh tablets, by the relative proportions in which they
      are drawn, just as plainly prove that the high-bred, stall-fed, prize
      cattle of Smithfield, not only equal, but far exceed in magnitude the
      fattest of Pharaoh’s fat kine; in the face of all this, I will not
      admit that of all animals the whale alone should have degenerated.
      
      But still another inquiry remains; one often agitated by the more
      recondite Nantucketers. Whether owing to the almost omniscient
      look-outs at the mast-heads of the whale-ships, now penetrating even
      through Behring’s straits, and into the remotest secret drawers and
      lockers of the world; and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along
      all continental coasts; the moot point is, whether Leviathan can long
      endure so wide a chase, and so remorseless a havoc; whether he must not
      at last be exterminated from the waters, and the last whale, like the
      last man, smoke his last pipe, and then himself evaporate in the final
      puff.
      
      Comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo,
      which, not forty years ago, overspread by tens of thousands the
      prairies of Illinois and Missouri, and shook their iron manes and
      scowled with their thunder-clotted brows upon the sites of populous
      river-capitals, where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar
      an inch; in such a comparison an irresistible argument would seem
      furnished, to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy
      extinction.
      
      But you must look at this matter in every light. Though so short a
      period ago—not a good lifetime—the census of the buffalo in Illinois
      exceeded the census of men now in London, and though at the present day
      not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region; and though the
      cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man; yet the far
      different nature of the whale-hunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious
      an end to the Leviathan. Forty men in one ship hunting the Sperm Whales
      for forty-eight months think they have done extremely well, and thank
      God, if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish. Whereas, in the
      days of the old Canadian and Indian hunters and trappers of the West,
      when the far west (in whose sunset suns still rise) was a wilderness
      and a virgin, the same number of moccasined men, for the same number of
      months, mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships, would have slain
      not forty, but forty thousand and more buffaloes; a fact that, if need
      were, could be statistically stated.
      
      Nor, considered aright, does it seem any argument in favour of the
      gradual extinction of the Sperm Whale, for example, that in former
      years (the latter part of the last century, say) these Leviathans, in
      small pods, were encountered much oftener than at present, and, in
      consequence, the voyages were not so prolonged, and were also much more
      remunerative. Because, as has been elsewhere noticed, those whales,
      influenced by some views to safety, now swim the seas in immense
      caravans, so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries, yokes,
      and pods, and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but
      widely separated, unfrequent armies. That is all. And equally
      fallacious seems the conceit, that because the so-called whale-bone
      whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years abounding with
      them, hence that species also is declining. For they are only being
      driven from promontory to cape; and if one coast is no longer enlivened
      with their jets, then, be sure, some other and remoter strand has been
      very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle.
      
      Furthermore: concerning these last mentioned Leviathans, they have two
      firm fortresses, which, in all human probability, will for ever remain
      impregnable. And as upon the invasion of their valleys, the frosty
      Swiss have retreated to their mountains; so, hunted from the savannas
      and glades of the middle seas, the whale-bone whales can at last resort
      to their Polar citadels, and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers
      and walls there, come up among icy fields and floes; and in a charmed
      circle of everlasting December, bid defiance to all pursuit from man.
      
      But as perhaps fifty of these whale-bone whales are harpooned for one
      cachalot, some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this
      positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions.
      But though for some time past a number of these whales, not less than
      13,000, have been annually slain on the nor’ west coast by the
      Americans alone; yet there are considerations which render even this
      circumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in this
      matter.
      
      Natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness
      of the more enormous creatures of the globe, yet what shall we say to
      Harto, the historian of Goa, when he tells us that at one hunting the
      King of Siam took 4,000 elephants; that in those regions elephants are
      numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes. And there seems
      no reason to doubt that if these elephants, which have now been hunted
      for thousands of years, by Semiramis, by Porus, by Hannibal, and by all
      the successive monarchs of the East—if they still survive there in
      great numbers, much more may the great whale outlast all hunting, since
      he has a pasture to expatiate in, which is precisely twice as large as
      all Asia, both Americas, Europe and Africa, New Holland, and all the
      Isles of the sea combined.
      
      Moreover: we are to consider, that from the presumed great longevity of
      whales, their probably attaining the age of a century and more,
      therefore at any one period of time, several distinct adult generations
      must be contemporary. And what that is, we may soon gain some idea of,
      by imagining all the grave-yards, cemeteries, and family vaults of
      creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men, women, and
      children who were alive seventy-five years ago; and adding this
      countless host to the present human population of the globe.
      
      Wherefore, for all these things, we account the whale immortal in his
      species, however perishable in his individuality. He swam the seas
      before the continents broke water; he once swam over the site of the
      Tuileries, and Windsor Castle, and the Kremlin. In Noah’s flood he
      despised Noah’s Ark; and if ever the world is to be again flooded, like
      the Netherlands, to kill off its rats, then the eternal whale will
      still survive, and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial
      flood, spout his frothed defiance to the skies.
      
      
      CHAPTER 106. Ahab’s Leg.
      
      The precipitating manner in which Captain Ahab had quitted the Samuel
      Enderby of London, had not been unattended with some small violence to
      his own person. He had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his
      boat that his ivory leg had received a half-splintering shock. And when
      after gaining his own deck, and his own pivot-hole there, he so
      vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman (it
      was, as ever, something about his not steering inflexibly enough);
      then, the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and
      wrench, that though it still remained entire, and to all appearances
      lusty, yet Ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy.
      
      And, indeed, it seemed small matter for wonder, that for all his
      pervading, mad recklessness, Ahab did at times give careful heed to the
      condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood. For it had not
      been very long prior to the Pequod’s sailing from Nantucket, that he
      had been found one night lying prone upon the ground, and insensible;
      by some unknown, and seemingly inexplicable, unimaginable casualty, his
      ivory limb having been so violently displaced, that it had stake-wise
      smitten, and all but pierced his groin; nor was it without extreme
      difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured.
      
      Nor, at the time, had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind, that all
      the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of
      a former woe; and he too plainly seemed to see, that as the most
      poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as
      the sweetest songster of the grove; so, equally with every felicity,
      all miserable events do naturally beget their like. Yea, more than
      equally, thought Ahab; since both the ancestry and posterity of Grief
      go further than the ancestry and posterity of Joy. For, not to hint of
      this: that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings, that
      while some natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to them
      for the other world, but, on the contrary, shall be followed by the
      joy-childlessness of all hell’s despair; whereas, some guilty mortal
      miseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves an eternally
      progressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave; not at all to hint of
      this, there still seems an inequality in the deeper analysis of the
      thing. For, thought Ahab, while even the highest earthly felicities
      ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them, but, at
      bottom, all heartwoes, a mystic significance, and, in some men, an
      archangelic grandeur; so do their diligent tracings-out not belie the
      obvious deduction. To trail the genealogies of these high mortal
      miseries, carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the
      gods; so that, in the face of all the glad, hay-making suns, and soft
      cymballing, round harvest-moons, we must needs give in to this: that
      the gods themselves are not for ever glad. The ineffaceable, sad
      birth-mark in the brow of man, is but the stamp of sorrow in the
      signers.
      
      Unwittingly here a secret has been divulged, which perhaps might more
      properly, in set way, have been disclosed before. With many other
      particulars concerning Ahab, always had it remained a mystery to some,
      why it was, that for a certain period, both before and after the
      sailing of the Pequod, he had hidden himself away with such
      Grand-Lama-like exclusiveness; and, for that one interval, sought
      speechless refuge, as it were, among the marble senate of the dead.
      Captain Peleg’s bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means
      adequate; though, indeed, as touching all Ahab’s deeper part, every
      revelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory
      light. But, in the end, it all came out; this one matter did, at least.
      That direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary recluseness. And
      not only this, but to that ever-contracting, dropping circle ashore,
      who, for any reason, possessed the privilege of a less banned approach
      to him; to that timid circle the above hinted casualty—remaining, as it
      did, moodily unaccounted for by Ahab—invested itself with terrors, not
      entirely underived from the land of spirits and of wails. So that,
      through their zeal for him, they had all conspired, so far as in them
      lay, to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others; and hence it
      was, that not till a considerable interval had elapsed, did it
      transpire upon the Pequod’s decks.
      
      But be all this as it may; let the unseen, ambiguous synod in the air,
      or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire, have to do or not
      with earthly Ahab, yet, in this present matter of his leg, he took
      plain practical procedures;—he called the carpenter.
      
      And when that functionary appeared before him, he bade him without
      delay set about making a new leg, and directed the mates to see him
      supplied with all the studs and joists of jaw-ivory (Sperm Whale) which
      had thus far been accumulated on the voyage, in order that a careful
      selection of the stoutest, clearest-grained stuff might be secured.
      This done, the carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that
      night; and to provide all the fittings for it, independent of those
      pertaining to the distrusted one in use. Moreover, the ship’s forge was
      ordered to be hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold; and,
      to accelerate the affair, the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at
      once to the forging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed.
      
      
      CHAPTER 107. The Carpenter.
      
      Seat thyself sultanically among the moons of Saturn, and take high
      abstracted man alone; and he seems a wonder, a grandeur, and a woe. But
      from the same point, take mankind in mass, and for the most part, they
      seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates, both contemporary and hereditary.
      But most humble though he was, and far from furnishing an example of
      the high, humane abstraction; the Pequod’s carpenter was no duplicate;
      hence, he now comes in person on this stage.
      
      Like all sea-going ship carpenters, and more especially those belonging
      to whaling vessels, he was, to a certain off-handed, practical extent,
      alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his
      own; the carpenter’s pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk
      of all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with
      wood as an auxiliary material. But, besides the application to him of
      the generic remark above, this carpenter of the Pequod was singularly
      efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually
      recurring in a large ship, upon a three or four years’ voyage, in
      uncivilized and far-distant seas. For not to speak of his readiness in
      ordinary duties:—repairing stove boats, sprung spars, reforming the
      shape of clumsy-bladed oars, inserting bull’s eyes in the deck, or new
      tree-nails in the side planks, and other miscellaneous matters more
      directly pertaining to his special business; he was moreover
      unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes, both
      useful and capricious.
      
      The one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold,
      was his vice-bench; a long rude ponderous table furnished with several
      vices, of different sizes, and both of iron and of wood. At all times
      except when whales were alongside, this bench was securely lashed
      athwartships against the rear of the Try-works.
      
      A belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole:
      the carpenter claps it into one of his ever-ready vices, and
      straightway files it smaller. A lost land-bird of strange plumage
      strays on board, and is made a captive: out of clean shaved rods of
      right-whale bone, and cross-beams of sperm whale ivory, the carpenter
      makes a pagoda-looking cage for it. An oarsman sprains his wrist: the
      carpenter concocts a soothing lotion. Stubb longed for vermillion stars
      to be painted upon the blade of his every oar; screwing each oar in his
      big vice of wood, the carpenter symmetrically supplies the
      constellation. A sailor takes a fancy to wear shark-bone ear-rings: the
      carpenter drills his ears. Another has the toothache: the carpenter out
      pincers, and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there;
      but the poor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded
      operation; whirling round the handle of his wooden vice, the carpenter
      signs him to clap his jaw in that, if he would have him draw the tooth.
      
      Thus, this carpenter was prepared at all points, and alike indifferent
      and without respect in all. Teeth he accounted bits of ivory; heads he
      deemed but top-blocks; men themselves he lightly held for capstans. But
      while now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with
      such liveliness of expertness in him, too; all this would seem to argue
      some uncommon vivacity of intelligence. But not precisely so. For
      nothing was this man more remarkable, than for a certain impersonal
      stolidity as it were; impersonal, I say; for it so shaded off into the
      surrounding infinite of things, that it seemed one with the general
      stolidity discernible in the whole visible world; which while
      pauselessly active in uncounted modes, still eternally holds its peace,
      and ignores you, though you dig foundations for cathedrals. Yet was
      this half-horrible stolidity in him, involving, too, as it appeared, an
      all-ramifying heartlessness;—yet was it oddly dashed at times, with an
      old, crutch-like, antediluvian, wheezing humorousness, not unstreaked
      now and then with a certain grizzled wittiness; such as might have
      served to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded
      forecastle of Noah’s ark. Was it that this old carpenter had been a
      life-long wanderer, whose much rolling, to and fro, not only had
      gathered no moss; but what is more, had rubbed off whatever small
      outward clingings might have originally pertained to him? He was a
      stript abstract; an unfractioned integral; uncompromised as a new-born
      babe; living without premeditated reference to this world or the next.
      You might almost say, that this strange uncompromisedness in him
      involved a sort of unintelligence; for in his numerous trades, he did
      not seem to work so much by reason or by instinct, or simply because he
      had been tutored to it, or by any intermixture of all these, even or
      uneven; but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb, spontaneous literal
      process. He was a pure manipulator; his brain, if he had ever had one,
      must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers. He was
      like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful, _multum in
      parvo_, Sheffield contrivances, assuming the exterior—though a little
      swelled—of a common pocket knife; but containing, not only blades of
      various sizes, but also screw-drivers, cork-screws, tweezers, awls,
      pens, rulers, nail-filers, countersinkers. So, if his superiors wanted
      to use the carpenter for a screw-driver, all they had to do was to open
      that part of him, and the screw was fast: or if for tweezers, take him
      up by the legs, and there they were.
      
      Yet, as previously hinted, this omnitooled, open-and-shut carpenter,
      was, after all, no mere machine of an automaton. If he did not have a
      common soul in him, he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously
      did its duty. What that was, whether essence of quicksilver, or a few
      drops of hartshorn, there is no telling. But there it was; and there it
      had abided for now some sixty years or more. And this it was, this same
      unaccountable, cunning life-principle in him; this it was, that kept
      him a great part of the time soliloquizing; but only like an
      unreasoning wheel, which also hummingly soliloquizes; or rather, his
      body was a sentry-box and this soliloquizer on guard there, and talking
      all the time to keep himself awake.
      
      
      CHAPTER 108. Ahab and the Carpenter.
      
      The Deck—First Night Watch.
      
      (_Carpenter standing before his vice-bench, and by the light of two
      lanterns busily filing the ivory joist for the leg, which joist is
      firmly fixed in the vice. Slabs of ivory, leather straps, pads, screws,
      and various tools of all sorts lying about the bench. Forward, the red
      flame of the forge is seen, where the blacksmith is at work._)
      
      Drat the file, and drat the bone! That is hard which should be soft,
      and that is soft which should be hard. So we go, who file old jaws and
      shinbones. Let’s try another. Aye, now, this works better (_sneezes_).
      Halloa, this bone dust is (_sneezes_)—why it’s (_sneezes_)—yes it’s
      (_sneezes_)—bless my soul, it won’t let me speak! This is what an old
      fellow gets now for working in dead lumber. Saw a live tree, and you
      don’t get this dust; amputate a live bone, and you don’t get it
      (_sneezes_). Come, come, you old Smut, there, bear a hand, and let’s
      have that ferule and buckle-screw; I’ll be ready for them presently.
      Lucky now (_sneezes_) there’s no knee-joint to make; that might puzzle
      a little; but a mere shinbone—why it’s easy as making hop-poles; only I
      should like to put a good finish on. Time, time; if I but only had the
      time, I could turn him out as neat a leg now as ever (_sneezes_)
      scraped to a lady in a parlor. Those buckskin legs and calves of legs
      I’ve seen in shop windows wouldn’t compare at all. They soak water,
      they do; and of course get rheumatic, and have to be doctored
      (_sneezes_) with washes and lotions, just like live legs. There; before
      I saw it off, now, I must call his old Mogulship, and see whether the
      length will be all right; too short, if anything, I guess. Ha! that’s
      the heel; we are in luck; here he comes, or it’s somebody else, that’s
      certain.
      
      AHAB (_advancing_). (_During the ensuing scene, the carpenter continues
      sneezing at times._)
      
      Well, manmaker!
      
      Just in time, sir. If the captain pleases, I will now mark the length.
      Let me measure, sir.
      
      Measured for a leg! good. Well, it’s not the first time. About it!
      There; keep thy finger on it. This is a cogent vice thou hast here,
      carpenter; let me feel its grip once. So, so; it does pinch some.
      
      Oh, sir, it will break bones—beware, beware!
      
      No fear; I like a good grip; I like to feel something in this slippery
      world that can hold, man. What’s Prometheus about there?—the
      blacksmith, I mean—what’s he about?
      
      He must be forging the buckle-screw, sir, now.
      
      Right. It’s a partnership; he supplies the muscle part. He makes a
      fierce red flame there!
      
      Aye, sir; he must have the white heat for this kind of fine work.
      
      Um-m. So he must. I do deem it now a most meaning thing, that that old
      Greek, Prometheus, who made men, they say, should have been a
      blacksmith, and animated them with fire; for what’s made in fire must
      properly belong to fire; and so hell’s probable. How the soot flies!
      This must be the remainder the Greek made the Africans of. Carpenter,
      when he’s through with that buckle, tell him to forge a pair of steel
      shoulder-blades; there’s a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack.
      
      Sir?
      
      Hold; while Prometheus is about it, I’ll order a complete man after a
      desirable pattern. Imprimis, fifty feet high in his socks; then, chest
      modelled after the Thames Tunnel; then, legs with roots to ’em, to stay
      in one place; then, arms three feet through the wrist; no heart at all,
      brass forehead, and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains; and let
      me see—shall I order eyes to see outwards? No, but put a sky-light on
      top of his head to illuminate inwards. There, take the order, and away.
      
      Now, what’s he speaking about, and who’s he speaking to, I should like
      to know? Shall I keep standing here? (_aside_).
      
      ’Tis but indifferent architecture to make a blind dome; here’s one. No,
      no, no; I must have a lantern.
      
      Ho, ho! That’s it, hey? Here are two, sir; one will serve my turn.
      
      What art thou thrusting that thief-catcher into my face for, man?
      Thrusted light is worse than presented pistols.
      
      I thought, sir, that you spoke to carpenter.
      
      Carpenter? why that’s—but no;—a very tidy, and, I may say, an extremely
      gentlemanlike sort of business thou art in here, carpenter;—or would’st
      thou rather work in clay?
      
      Sir?—Clay? clay, sir? That’s mud; we leave clay to ditchers, sir.
      
      The fellow’s impious! What art thou sneezing about?
      
      Bone is rather dusty, sir.
      
      Take the hint, then; and when thou art dead, never bury thyself under
      living people’s noses.
      
      Sir?—oh! ah!—I guess so;—yes—oh, dear!
      
      Look ye, carpenter, I dare say thou callest thyself a right good
      workmanlike workman, eh? Well, then, will it speak thoroughly well for
      thy work, if, when I come to mount this leg thou makest, I shall
      nevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it; that
      is, carpenter, my old lost leg; the flesh and blood one, I mean. Canst
      thou not drive that old Adam away?
      
      Truly, sir, I begin to understand somewhat now. Yes, I have heard
      something curious on that score, sir; how that a dismasted man never
      entirely loses the feeling of his old spar, but it will be still
      pricking him at times. May I humbly ask if it be really so, sir?
      
      It is, man. Look, put thy live leg here in the place where mine once
      was; so, now, here is only one distinct leg to the eye, yet two to the
      soul. Where thou feelest tingling life; there, exactly there, there to
      a hair, do I. Is’t a riddle?
      
      I should humbly call it a poser, sir.
      
      Hist, then. How dost thou know that some entire, living, thinking thing
      may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where
      thou now standest; aye, and standing there in thy spite? In thy most
      solitary hours, then, dost thou not fear eavesdroppers? Hold, don’t
      speak! And if I still feel the smart of my crushed leg, though it be
      now so long dissolved; then, why mayst not thou, carpenter, feel the
      fiery pains of hell for ever, and without a body? Hah!
      
      Good Lord! Truly, sir, if it comes to that, I must calculate over
      again; I think I didn’t carry a small figure, sir.
      
      Look ye, pudding-heads should never grant premises.—How long before the
      leg is done?
      
      Perhaps an hour, sir.
      
      Bungle away at it then, and bring it to me (_turns to go_). Oh, Life!
      Here I am, proud as Greek god, and yet standing debtor to this
      blockhead for a bone to stand on! Cursed be that mortal
      inter-indebtedness which will not do away with ledgers. I would be free
      as air; and I’m down in the whole world’s books. I am so rich, I could
      have given bid for bid with the wealthiest Prætorians at the auction of
      the Roman empire (which was the world’s); and yet I owe for the flesh
      in the tongue I brag with. By heavens! I’ll get a crucible, and into
      it, and dissolve myself down to one small, compendious vertebra. So.
      
      CARPENTER (_resuming his work_).
      
      Well, well, well! Stubb knows him best of all, and Stubb always says
      he’s queer; says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer;
      he’s queer, says Stubb; he’s queer—queer, queer; and keeps dinning it
      into Mr. Starbuck all the time—queer—sir—queer, queer, very queer. And
      here’s his leg! Yes, now that I think of it, here’s his bedfellow! has
      a stick of whale’s jaw-bone for a wife! And this is his leg; he’ll
      stand on this. What was that now about one leg standing in three
      places, and all three places standing in one hell—how was that? Oh! I
      don’t wonder he looked so scornful at me! I’m a sort of
      strange-thoughted sometimes, they say; but that’s only haphazard-like.
      Then, a short, little old body like me, should never undertake to wade
      out into deep waters with tall, heron-built captains; the water chucks
      you under the chin pretty quick, and there’s a great cry for
      life-boats. And here’s the heron’s leg! long and slim, sure enough!
      Now, for most folks one pair of legs lasts a lifetime, and that must be
      because they use them mercifully, as a tender-hearted old lady uses her
      roly-poly old coach-horses. But Ahab; oh he’s a hard driver. Look,
      driven one leg to death, and spavined the other for life, and now wears
      out bone legs by the cord. Halloa, there, you Smut! bear a hand there
      with those screws, and let’s finish it before the resurrection fellow
      comes a-calling with his horn for all legs, true or false, as
      brewery-men go round collecting old beer barrels, to fill ’em up again.
      What a leg this is! It looks like a real live leg, filed down to
      nothing but the core; he’ll be standing on this to-morrow; he’ll be
      taking altitudes on it. Halloa! I almost forgot the little oval slate,
      smoothed ivory, where he figures up the latitude. So, so; chisel, file,
      and sand-paper, now!
      
      
      CHAPTER 109. Ahab and Starbuck in the Cabin.
      
      According to usage they were pumping the ship next morning; and lo! no
      inconsiderable oil came up with the water; the casks below must have
      sprung a bad leak. Much concern was shown; and Starbuck went down into
      the cabin to report this unfavourable affair.*
      
      *In Sperm-whalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board, it
      is a regular semi-weekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold, and
      drench the casks with sea-water; which afterwards, at varying
      intervals, is removed by the ship’s pumps. Hereby the casks are sought
      to be kept damply tight; while by the changed character of the
      withdrawn water, the mariners readily detect any serious leakage in the
      precious cargo.
      
      Now, from the South and West the Pequod was drawing nigh to Formosa and
      the Bashee Isles, between which lies one of the tropical outlets from
      the China waters into the Pacific. And so Starbuck found Ahab with a
      general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him; and
      another separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the
      Japanese islands—Niphon, Matsmai, and Sikoke. With his snow-white new
      ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table, and with a long
      pruning-hook of a jack-knife in his hand, the wondrous old man, with
      his back to the gangway door, was wrinkling his brow, and tracing his
      old courses again.
      
      “Who’s there?” hearing the footstep at the door, but not turning round
      to it. “On deck! Begone!”
      
      “Captain Ahab mistakes; it is I. The oil in the hold is leaking, sir.
      We must up Burtons and break out.”
      
      “Up Burtons and break out? Now that we are nearing Japan; heave-to here
      for a week to tinker a parcel of old hoops?”
      
      “Either do that, sir, or waste in one day more oil than we may make
      good in a year. What we come twenty thousand miles to get is worth
      saving, sir.”
      
      “So it is, so it is; if we get it.”
      
      “I was speaking of the oil in the hold, sir.”
      
      “And I was not speaking or thinking of that at all. Begone! Let it
      leak! I’m all aleak myself. Aye! leaks in leaks! not only full of leaky
      casks, but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship; and that’s a far
      worse plight than the Pequod’s, man. Yet I don’t stop to plug my leak;
      for who can find it in the deep-loaded hull; or how hope to plug it,
      even if found, in this life’s howling gale? Starbuck! I’ll not have the
      Burtons hoisted.”
      
      “What will the owners say, sir?”
      
      “Let the owners stand on Nantucket beach and outyell the Typhoons. What
      cares Ahab? Owners, owners? Thou art always prating to me, Starbuck,
      about those miserly owners, as if the owners were my conscience. But
      look ye, the only real owner of anything is its commander; and hark ye,
      my conscience is in this ship’s keel.—On deck!”
      
      “Captain Ahab,” said the reddening mate, moving further into the cabin,
      with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost
      seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward
      manifestation of itself, but within also seemed more than half
      distrustful of itself; “A better man than I might well pass over in
      thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man; aye, and in
      a happier, Captain Ahab.”
      
      “Devils! Dost thou then so much as dare to critically think of me?—On
      deck!”
      
      “Nay, sir, not yet; I do entreat. And I do dare, sir—to be forbearing!
      Shall we not understand each other better than hitherto, Captain Ahab?”
      
      Ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack (forming part of most
      South-Sea-men’s cabin furniture), and pointing it towards Starbuck,
      exclaimed: “There is one God that is Lord over the earth, and one
      Captain that is lord over the Pequod.—On deck!”
      
      For an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate, and his fiery cheeks,
      you would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze of
      the levelled tube. But, mastering his emotion, he half calmly rose, and
      as he quitted the cabin, paused for an instant and said: “Thou hast
      outraged, not insulted me, sir; but for that I ask thee not to beware
      of Starbuck; thou wouldst but laugh; but let Ahab beware of Ahab;
      beware of thyself, old man.”
      
      “He waxes brave, but nevertheless obeys; most careful bravery that!”
      murmured Ahab, as Starbuck disappeared. “What’s that he said—Ahab
      beware of Ahab—there’s something there!” Then unconsciously using the
      musket for a staff, with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little
      cabin; but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed, and
      returning the gun to the rack, he went to the deck.
      
      “Thou art but too good a fellow, Starbuck,” he said lowly to the mate;
      then raising his voice to the crew: “Furl the t’gallant-sails, and
      close-reef the top-sails, fore and aft; back the main-yard; up Burton,
      and break out in the main-hold.”
      
      It were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was, that as respecting
      Starbuck, Ahab thus acted. It may have been a flash of honesty in him;
      or mere prudential policy which, under the circumstance, imperiously
      forbade the slightest symptom of open disaffection, however transient,
      in the important chief officer of his ship. However it was, his orders
      were executed; and the Burtons were hoisted.
      
      
      CHAPTER 110. Queequeg in His Coffin.
      
      Upon searching, it was found that the casks last struck into the hold
      were perfectly sound, and that the leak must be further off. So, it
      being calm weather, they broke out deeper and deeper, disturbing the
      slumbers of the huge ground-tier butts; and from that black midnight
      sending those gigantic moles into the daylight above. So deep did they
      go; and so ancient, and corroded, and weedy the aspect of the lowermost
      puncheons, that you almost looked next for some mouldy corner-stone
      cask containing coins of Captain Noah, with copies of the posted
      placards, vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood.
      Tierce after tierce, too, of water, and bread, and beef, and shooks of
      staves, and iron bundles of hoops, were hoisted out, till at last the
      piled decks were hard to get about; and the hollow hull echoed under
      foot, as if you were treading over empty catacombs, and reeled and
      rolled in the sea like an air-freighted demijohn. Top-heavy was the
      ship as a dinnerless student with all Aristotle in his head. Well was
      it that the Typhoons did not visit them then.
      
      Now, at this time it was that my poor pagan companion, and fast
      bosom-friend, Queequeg, was seized with a fever, which brought him nigh
      to his endless end.
      
      Be it said, that in this vocation of whaling, sinecures are unknown;
      dignity and danger go hand in hand; till you get to be Captain, the
      higher you rise the harder you toil. So with poor Queequeg, who, as
      harpooneer, must not only face all the rage of the living whale, but—as
      we have elsewhere seen—mount his dead back in a rolling sea; and
      finally descend into the gloom of the hold, and bitterly sweating all
      day in that subterraneous confinement, resolutely manhandle the
      clumsiest casks and see to their stowage. To be short, among whalemen,
      the harpooneers are the holders, so called.
      
      Poor Queequeg! when the ship was about half disembowelled, you should
      have stooped over the hatchway, and peered down upon him there; where,
      stripped to his woollen drawers, the tattooed savage was crawling about
      amid that dampness and slime, like a green spotted lizard at the bottom
      of a well. And a well, or an ice-house, it somehow proved to him, poor
      pagan; where, strange to say, for all the heat of his sweatings, he
      caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever; and at last, after
      some days’ suffering, laid him in his hammock, close to the very sill
      of the door of death. How he wasted and wasted away in those few
      long-lingering days, till there seemed but little left of him but his
      frame and tattooing. But as all else in him thinned, and his
      cheek-bones grew sharper, his eyes, nevertheless, seemed growing fuller
      and fuller; they became of a strange softness of lustre; and mildly but
      deeply looked out at you there from his sickness, a wondrous testimony
      to that immortal health in him which could not die, or be weakened. And
      like circles on the water, which, as they grow fainter, expand; so his
      eyes seemed rounding and rounding, like the rings of Eternity. An awe
      that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of
      this waning savage, and saw as strange things in his face, as any
      beheld who were bystanders when Zoroaster died. For whatever is truly
      wondrous and fearful in man, never yet was put into words or books. And
      the drawing near of Death, which alike levels all, alike impresses all
      with a last revelation, which only an author from the dead could
      adequately tell. So that—let us say it again—no dying Chaldee or Greek
      had higher and holier thoughts than those, whose mysterious shades you
      saw creeping over the face of poor Queequeg, as he quietly lay in his
      swaying hammock, and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his
      final rest, and the ocean’s invisible flood-tide lifted him higher and
      higher towards his destined heaven.
      
      Not a man of the crew but gave him up; and, as for Queequeg himself,
      what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he
      asked. He called one to him in the grey morning watch, when the day was
      just breaking, and taking his hand, said that while in Nantucket he had
      chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood, like the rich
      war-wood of his native isle; and upon inquiry, he had learned that all
      whalemen who died in Nantucket, were laid in those same dark canoes,
      and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him; for it was
      not unlike the custom of his own race, who, after embalming a dead
      warrior, stretched him out in his canoe, and so left him to be floated
      away to the starry archipelagoes; for not only do they believe that the
      stars are isles, but that far beyond all visible horizons, their own
      mild, uncontinented seas, interflow with the blue heavens; and so form
      the white breakers of the milky way. He added, that he shuddered at the
      thought of being buried in his hammock, according to the usual
      sea-custom, tossed like something vile to the death-devouring sharks.
      No: he desired a canoe like those of Nantucket, all the more congenial
      to him, being a whaleman, that like a whale-boat these coffin-canoes
      were without a keel; though that involved but uncertain steering, and
      much lee-way adown the dim ages.
      
      Now, when this strange circumstance was made known aft, the carpenter
      was at once commanded to do Queequeg’s bidding, whatever it might
      include. There was some heathenish, coffin-coloured old lumber aboard,
      which, upon a long previous voyage, had been cut from the aboriginal
      groves of the Lackaday islands, and from these dark planks the coffin
      was recommended to be made. No sooner was the carpenter apprised of the
      order, than taking his rule, he forthwith with all the indifferent
      promptitude of his character, proceeded into the forecastle and took
      Queequeg’s measure with great accuracy, regularly chalking Queequeg’s
      person as he shifted the rule.
      
      “Ah! poor fellow! he’ll have to die now,” ejaculated the Long Island
      sailor.
      
      Going to his vice-bench, the carpenter for convenience sake and general
      reference, now transferringly measured on it the exact length the
      coffin was to be, and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two
      notches at its extremities. This done, he marshalled the planks and his
      tools, and to work.
      
      When the last nail was driven, and the lid duly planed and fitted, he
      lightly shouldered the coffin and went forward with it, inquiring
      whether they were ready for it yet in that direction.
      
      Overhearing the indignant but half-humorous cries with which the people
      on deck began to drive the coffin away, Queequeg, to every one’s
      consternation, commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to
      him, nor was there any denying him; seeing that, of all mortals, some
      dying men are the most tyrannical; and certainly, since they will
      shortly trouble us so little for evermore, the poor fellows ought to be
      indulged.
      
      Leaning over in his hammock, Queequeg long regarded the coffin with an
      attentive eye. He then called for his harpoon, had the wooden stock
      drawn from it, and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along
      with one of the paddles of his boat. All by his own request, also,
      biscuits were then ranged round the sides within: a flask of fresh
      water was placed at the head, and a small bag of woody earth scraped up
      in the hold at the foot; and a piece of sail-cloth being rolled up for
      a pillow, Queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed, that
      he might make trial of its comforts, if any it had. He lay without
      moving a few minutes, then told one to go to his bag and bring out his
      little god, Yojo. Then crossing his arms on his breast with Yojo
      between, he called for the coffin lid (hatch he called it) to be placed
      over him. The head part turned over with a leather hinge, and there lay
      Queequeg in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in
      view. “Rarmai” (it will do; it is easy), he murmured at last, and
      signed to be replaced in his hammock.
      
      But ere this was done, Pip, who had been slily hovering near by all
      this while, drew nigh to him where he lay, and with soft sobbings, took
      him by the hand; in the other, holding his tambourine.
      
      “Poor rover! will ye never have done with all this weary roving? where
      go ye now? But if the currents carry ye to those sweet Antilles where
      the beaches are only beat with water-lilies, will ye do one little
      errand for me? Seek out one Pip, who’s now been missing long: I think
      he’s in those far Antilles. If ye find him, then comfort him; for he
      must be very sad; for look! he’s left his tambourine behind;—I found
      it. Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! Now, Queequeg, die; and I’ll beat ye your
      dying march.”
      
      “I have heard,” murmured Starbuck, gazing down the scuttle, “that in
      violent fevers, men, all ignorance, have talked in ancient tongues; and
      that when the mystery is probed, it turns out always that in their
      wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken
      in their hearing by some lofty scholars. So, to my fond faith, poor
      Pip, in this strange sweetness of his lunacy, brings heavenly vouchers
      of all our heavenly homes. Where learned he that, but there?—Hark! he
      speaks again: but more wildly now.”
      
      “Form two and two! Let’s make a General of him! Ho, where’s his
      harpoon? Lay it across here.—Rig-a-dig, dig, dig! huzza! Oh for a game
      cock now to sit upon his head and crow! Queequeg dies game!—mind ye
      that; Queequeg dies game!—take ye good heed of that; Queequeg dies
      game! I say; game, game, game! but base little Pip, he died a coward;
      died all a’shiver;—out upon Pip! Hark ye; if ye find Pip, tell all the
      Antilles he’s a runaway; a coward, a coward, a coward! Tell them he
      jumped from a whale-boat! I’d never beat my tambourine over base Pip,
      and hail him General, if he were once more dying here. No, no! shame
      upon all cowards—shame upon them! Let ’em go drown like Pip, that
      jumped from a whale-boat. Shame! shame!”
      
      During all this, Queequeg lay with closed eyes, as if in a dream. Pip
      was led away, and the sick man was replaced in his hammock.
      
      But now that he had apparently made every preparation for death; now
      that his coffin was proved a good fit, Queequeg suddenly rallied; soon
      there seemed no need of the carpenter’s box: and thereupon, when some
      expressed their delighted surprise, he, in substance, said, that the
      cause of his sudden convalescence was this;—at a critical moment, he
      had just recalled a little duty ashore, which he was leaving undone;
      and therefore had changed his mind about dying: he could not die yet,
      he averred. They asked him, then, whether to live or die was a matter
      of his own sovereign will and pleasure. He answered, certainly. In a
      word, it was Queequeg’s conceit, that if a man made up his mind to
      live, mere sickness could not kill him: nothing but a whale, or a gale,
      or some violent, ungovernable, unintelligent destroyer of that sort.
      
      Now, there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized;
      that while a sick, civilized man may be six months convalescing,
      generally speaking, a sick savage is almost half-well again in a day.
      So, in good time my Queequeg gained strength; and at length after
      sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days (but eating with a
      vigorous appetite) he suddenly leaped to his feet, threw out his arms
      and legs, gave himself a good stretching, yawned a little bit, and then
      springing into the head of his hoisted boat, and poising a harpoon,
      pronounced himself fit for a fight.
      
      With a wild whimsiness, he now used his coffin for a sea-chest; and
      emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes, set them in order there.
      Many spare hours he spent, in carving the lid with all manner of
      grotesque figures and drawings; and it seemed that hereby he was
      striving, in his rude way, to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on
      his body. And this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet
      and seer of his island, who, by those hieroglyphic marks, had written
      out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth, and a
      mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth; so that Queequeg in
      his own proper person was a riddle to unfold; a wondrous work in one
      volume; but whose mysteries not even himself could read, though his own
      live heart beat against them; and these mysteries were therefore
      destined in the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon
      they were inscribed, and so be unsolved to the last. And this thought
      it must have been which suggested to Ahab that wild exclamation of his,
      when one morning turning away from surveying poor Queequeg—“Oh,
      devilish tantalization of the gods!”
      
      
      CHAPTER 111. The Pacific.
      
      When gliding by the Bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great
      South Sea; were it not for other things, I could have greeted my dear
      Pacific with uncounted thanks, for now the long supplication of my
      youth was answered; that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a
      thousand leagues of blue.
      
      There is, one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea, whose gently
      awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath; like those
      fabled undulations of the Ephesian sod over the buried Evangelist St.
      John. And meet it is, that over these sea-pastures, wide-rolling watery
      prairies and Potters’ Fields of all four continents, the waves should
      rise and fall, and ebb and flow unceasingly; for here, millions of
      mixed shades and shadows, drowned dreams, somnambulisms, reveries; all
      that we call lives and souls, lie dreaming, dreaming, still; tossing
      like slumberers in their beds; the ever-rolling waves but made so by
      their restlessness.
      
      To any meditative Magian rover, this serene Pacific, once beheld, must
      ever after be the sea of his adoption. It rolls the midmost waters of
      the world, the Indian ocean and Atlantic being but its arms. The same
      waves wash the moles of the new-built Californian towns, but yesterday
      planted by the recentest race of men, and lave the faded but still
      gorgeous skirts of Asiatic lands, older than Abraham; while all between
      float milky-ways of coral isles, and low-lying, endless, unknown
      Archipelagoes, and impenetrable Japans. Thus this mysterious, divine
      Pacific zones the world’s whole bulk about; makes all coasts one bay to
      it; seems the tide-beating heart of earth. Lifted by those eternal
      swells, you needs must own the seductive god, bowing your head to Pan.
      
      But few thoughts of Pan stirred Ahab’s brain, as standing like an iron
      statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging, with one
      nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the Bashee isles
      (in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walking), and with the other
      consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea; that sea in
      which the hated White Whale must even then be swimming. Launched at
      length upon these almost final waters, and gliding towards the Japanese
      cruising-ground, the old man’s purpose intensified itself. His firm
      lips met like the lips of a vice; the Delta of his forehead’s veins
      swelled like overladen brooks; in his very sleep, his ringing cry ran
      through the vaulted hull, “Stern all! the White Whale spouts thick
      blood!”
      
      
      CHAPTER 112. The Blacksmith.
      
      Availing himself of the mild, summer-cool weather that now reigned in
      these latitudes, and in preparation for the peculiarly active pursuits
      shortly to be anticipated, Perth, the begrimed, blistered old
      blacksmith, had not removed his portable forge to the hold again, after
      concluding his contributory work for Ahab’s leg, but still retained it
      on deck, fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast; being now almost
      incessantly invoked by the headsmen, and harpooneers, and bowsmen to do
      some little job for them; altering, or repairing, or new shaping their
      various weapons and boat furniture. Often he would be surrounded by an
      eager circle, all waiting to be served; holding boat-spades,
      pike-heads, harpoons, and lances, and jealously watching his every
      sooty movement, as he toiled. Nevertheless, this old man’s was a
      patient hammer wielded by a patient arm. No murmur, no impatience, no
      petulance did come from him. Silent, slow, and solemn; bowing over
      still further his chronically broken back, he toiled away, as if toil
      were life itself, and the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating
      of his heart. And so it was.—Most miserable!
      
      A peculiar walk in this old man, a certain slight but painful appearing
      yawing in his gait, had at an early period of the voyage excited the
      curiosity of the mariners. And to the importunity of their persisted
      questionings he had finally given in; and so it came to pass that every
      one now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate.
      
      Belated, and not innocently, one bitter winter’s midnight, on the road
      running between two country towns, the blacksmith half-stupidly felt
      the deadly numbness stealing over him, and sought refuge in a leaning,
      dilapidated barn. The issue was, the loss of the extremities of both
      feet. Out of this revelation, part by part, at last came out the four
      acts of the gladness, and the one long, and as yet uncatastrophied
      fifth act of the grief of his life’s drama.
      
      He was an old man, who, at the age of nearly sixty, had postponedly
      encountered that thing in sorrow’s technicals called ruin. He had been
      an artisan of famed excellence, and with plenty to do; owned a house
      and garden; embraced a youthful, daughter-like, loving wife, and three
      blithe, ruddy children; every Sunday went to a cheerful-looking church,
      planted in a grove. But one night, under cover of darkness, and further
      concealed in a most cunning disguisement, a desperate burglar slid into
      his happy home, and robbed them all of everything. And darker yet to
      tell, the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into
      his family’s heart. It was the Bottle Conjuror! Upon the opening of
      that fatal cork, forth flew the fiend, and shrivelled up his home. Now,
      for prudent, most wise, and economic reasons, the blacksmith’s shop was
      in the basement of his dwelling, but with a separate entrance to it; so
      that always had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no
      unhappy nervousness, but with vigorous pleasure, to the stout ringing
      of her young-armed old husband’s hammer; whose reverberations, muffled
      by passing through the floors and walls, came up to her, not unsweetly,
      in her nursery; and so, to stout Labor’s iron lullaby, the blacksmith’s
      infants were rocked to slumber.
      
      Oh, woe on woe! Oh, Death, why canst thou not sometimes be timely?
      Hadst thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came
      upon him, then had the young widow had a delicious grief, and her
      orphans a truly venerable, legendary sire to dream of in their after
      years; and all of them a care-killing competency. But Death plucked
      down some virtuous elder brother, on whose whistling daily toil solely
      hung the responsibilities of some other family, and left the worse than
      useless old man standing, till the hideous rot of life should make him
      easier to harvest.
      
      Why tell the whole? The blows of the basement hammer every day grew
      more and more between; and each blow every day grew fainter than the
      last; the wife sat frozen at the window, with tearless eyes,
      glitteringly gazing into the weeping faces of her children; the bellows
      fell; the forge choked up with cinders; the house was sold; the mother
      dived down into the long church-yard grass; her children twice followed
      her thither; and the houseless, familyless old man staggered off a
      vagabond in crape; his every woe unreverenced; his grey head a scorn to
      flaxen curls!
      
      Death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this; but Death
      is only a launching into the region of the strange Untried; it is but
      the first salutation to the possibilities of the immense Remote, the
      Wild, the Watery, the Unshored; therefore, to the death-longing eyes of
      such men, who still have left in them some interior compunctions
      against suicide, does the all-contributed and all-receptive ocean
      alluringly spread forth his whole plain of unimaginable, taking
      terrors, and wonderful, new-life adventures; and from the hearts of
      infinite Pacifics, the thousand mermaids sing to them—“Come hither,
      broken-hearted; here is another life without the guilt of intermediate
      death; here are wonders supernatural, without dying for them. Come
      hither! bury thyself in a life which, to your now equally abhorred and
      abhorring, landed world, is more oblivious than death. Come hither! put
      up _thy_ gravestone, too, within the churchyard, and come hither, till
      we marry thee!”
      
      Hearkening to these voices, East and West, by early sunrise, and by
      fall of eve, the blacksmith’s soul responded, Aye, I come! And so Perth
      went a-whaling.
      
      
      CHAPTER 113. The Forge.
      
      With matted beard, and swathed in a bristling shark-skin apron, about
      mid-day, Perth was standing between his forge and anvil, the latter
      placed upon an iron-wood log, with one hand holding a pike-head in the
      coals, and with the other at his forge’s lungs, when Captain Ahab came
      along, carrying in his hand a small rusty-looking leathern bag. While
      yet a little distance from the forge, moody Ahab paused; till at last,
      Perth, withdrawing his iron from the fire, began hammering it upon the
      anvil—the red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights,
      some of which flew close to Ahab.
      
      “Are these thy Mother Carey’s chickens, Perth? they are always flying
      in thy wake; birds of good omen, too, but not to all;—look here, they
      burn; but thou—thou liv’st among them without a scorch.”
      
      “Because I am scorched all over, Captain Ahab,” answered Perth, resting
      for a moment on his hammer; “I am past scorching; not easily can’st
      thou scorch a scar.”
      
      “Well, well; no more. Thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly, sanely woeful
      to me. In no Paradise myself, I am impatient of all misery in others
      that is not mad. Thou should’st go mad, blacksmith; say, why dost thou
      not go mad? How can’st thou endure without being mad? Do the heavens
      yet hate thee, that thou can’st not go mad?—What wert thou making
      there?”
      
      “Welding an old pike-head, sir; there were seams and dents in it.”
      
      “And can’st thou make it all smooth again, blacksmith, after such hard
      usage as it had?”
      
      “I think so, sir.”
      
      “And I suppose thou can’st smoothe almost any seams and dents; never
      mind how hard the metal, blacksmith?”
      
      “Aye, sir, I think I can; all seams and dents but one.”
      
      “Look ye here, then,” cried Ahab, passionately advancing, and leaning
      with both hands on Perth’s shoulders; “look ye here—_here_—can ye
      smoothe out a seam like this, blacksmith,” sweeping one hand across his
      ribbed brow; “if thou could’st, blacksmith, glad enough would I lay my
      head upon thy anvil, and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes.
      Answer! Can’st thou smoothe this seam?”
      
      “Oh! that is the one, sir! Said I not all seams and dents but one?”
      
      “Aye, blacksmith, it is the one; aye, man, it is unsmoothable; for
      though thou only see’st it here in my flesh, it has worked down into
      the bone of my skull—_that_ is all wrinkles! But, away with child’s
      play; no more gaffs and pikes to-day. Look ye here!” jingling the
      leathern bag, as if it were full of gold coins. “I, too, want a harpoon
      made; one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part, Perth;
      something that will stick in a whale like his own fin-bone. There’s the
      stuff,” flinging the pouch upon the anvil. “Look ye, blacksmith, these
      are the gathered nail-stubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses.”
      
      “Horse-shoe stubbs, sir? Why, Captain Ahab, thou hast here, then, the
      best and stubbornest stuff we blacksmiths ever work.”
      
      “I know it, old man; these stubbs will weld together like glue from the
      melted bones of murderers. Quick! forge me the harpoon. And forge me
      first, twelve rods for its shank; then wind, and twist, and hammer
      these twelve together like the yarns and strands of a tow-line. Quick!
      I’ll blow the fire.”
      
      When at last the twelve rods were made, Ahab tried them, one by one, by
      spiralling them, with his own hand, round a long, heavy iron bolt. “A
      flaw!” rejecting the last one. “Work that over again, Perth.”
      
      This done, Perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one, when
      Ahab stayed his hand, and said he would weld his own iron. As, then,
      with regular, gasping hems, he hammered on the anvil, Perth passing to
      him the glowing rods, one after the other, and the hard pressed forge
      shooting up its intense straight flame, the Parsee passed silently, and
      bowing over his head towards the fire, seemed invoking some curse or
      some blessing on the toil. But, as Ahab looked up, he slid aside.
      
      “What’s that bunch of lucifers dodging about there for?” muttered
      Stubb, looking on from the forecastle. “That Parsee smells fire like a
      fusee; and smells of it himself, like a hot musket’s powder-pan.”
      
      At last the shank, in one complete rod, received its final heat; and as
      Perth, to temper it, plunged it all hissing into the cask of water near
      by, the scalding steam shot up into Ahab’s bent face.
      
      “Would’st thou brand me, Perth?” wincing for a moment with the pain;
      “have I been but forging my own branding-iron, then?”
      
      “Pray God, not that; yet I fear something, Captain Ahab. Is not this
      harpoon for the White Whale?”
      
      “For the white fiend! But now for the barbs; thou must make them
      thyself, man. Here are my razors—the best of steel; here, and make the
      barbs sharp as the needle-sleet of the Icy Sea.”
      
      For a moment, the old blacksmith eyed the razors as though he would
      fain not use them.
      
      “Take them, man, I have no need for them; for I now neither shave, sup,
      nor pray till—but here—to work!”
      
      Fashioned at last into an arrowy shape, and welded by Perth to the
      shank, the steel soon pointed the end of the iron; and as the
      blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat, prior to
      tempering them, he cried to Ahab to place the water-cask near.
      
      “No, no—no water for that; I want it of the true death-temper. Ahoy,
      there! Tashtego, Queequeg, Daggoo! What say ye, pagans! Will ye give me
      as much blood as will cover this barb?” holding it high up. A cluster
      of dark nods replied, Yes. Three punctures were made in the heathen
      flesh, and the White Whale’s barbs were then tempered.
      
      “Ego non baptizo te in nomine patris, sed in nomine diaboli!”
      deliriously howled Ahab, as the malignant iron scorchingly devoured the
      baptismal blood.
      
      Now, mustering the spare poles from below, and selecting one of
      hickory, with the bark still investing it, Ahab fitted the end to the
      socket of the iron. A coil of new tow-line was then unwound, and some
      fathoms of it taken to the windlass, and stretched to a great tension.
      Pressing his foot upon it, till the rope hummed like a harp-string,
      then eagerly bending over it, and seeing no strandings, Ahab exclaimed,
      “Good! and now for the seizings.”
      
      At one extremity the rope was unstranded, and the separate spread yarns
      were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon; the pole
      was then driven hard up into the socket; from the lower end the rope
      was traced half-way along the pole’s length, and firmly secured so,
      with intertwistings of twine. This done, pole, iron, and rope—like the
      Three Fates—remained inseparable, and Ahab moodily stalked away with
      the weapon; the sound of his ivory leg, and the sound of the hickory
      pole, both hollowly ringing along every plank. But ere he entered his
      cabin, light, unnatural, half-bantering, yet most piteous sound was
      heard. Oh, Pip! thy wretched laugh, thy idle but unresting eye; all thy
      strange mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the
      melancholy ship, and mocked it!
      
      
      CHAPTER 114. The Gilder.
      
      Penetrating further and further into the heart of the Japanese cruising
      ground, the Pequod was soon all astir in the fishery. Often, in mild,
      pleasant weather, for twelve, fifteen, eighteen, and twenty hours on
      the stretch, they were engaged in the boats, steadily pulling, or
      sailing, or paddling after the whales, or for an interlude of sixty or
      seventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprising; though with but small
      success for their pains.
      
      At such times, under an abated sun; afloat all day upon smooth, slow
      heaving swells; seated in his boat, light as a birch canoe; and so
      sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves, that like hearth-stone
      cats they purr against the gunwale; these are the times of dreamy
      quietude, when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the
      ocean’s skin, one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it; and
      would not willingly remember, that this velvet paw but conceals a
      remorseless fang.
      
      These are the times, when in his whale-boat the rover softly feels a
      certain filial, confident, land-like feeling towards the sea; that he
      regards it as so much flowery earth; and the distant ship revealing
      only the tops of her masts, seems struggling forward, not through high
      rolling waves, but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie: as when
      the western emigrants’ horses only show their erected ears, while their
      hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure.
      
      The long-drawn virgin vales; the mild blue hill-sides; as over these
      there steals the hush, the hum; you almost swear that play-wearied
      children lie sleeping in these solitudes, in some glad May-time, when
      the flowers of the woods are plucked. And all this mixes with your most
      mystic mood; so that fact and fancy, half-way meeting, interpenetrate,
      and form one seamless whole.
      
      Nor did such soothing scenes, however temporary, fail of at least as
      temporary an effect on Ahab. But if these secret golden keys did seem
      to open in him his own secret golden treasuries, yet did his breath
      upon them prove but tarnishing.
      
      Oh, grassy glades! oh, ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul; in
      ye,—though long parched by the dead drought of the earthy life,—in ye,
      men yet may roll, like young horses in new morning clover; and for some
      few fleeting moments, feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them.
      Would to God these blessed calms would last. But the mingled, mingling
      threads of life are woven by warp and woof: calms crossed by storms, a
      storm for every calm. There is no steady unretracing progress in this
      life; we do not advance through fixed gradations, and at the last one
      pause:—through infancy’s unconscious spell, boyhood’s thoughtless
      faith, adolescence’ doubt (the common doom), then scepticism, then
      disbelief, resting at last in manhood’s pondering repose of If. But
      once gone through, we trace the round again; and are infants, boys, and
      men, and Ifs eternally. Where lies the final harbor, whence we unmoor
      no more? In what rapt ether sails the world, of which the weariest will
      never weary? Where is the foundling’s father hidden? Our souls are like
      those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them: the secret of
      our paternity lies in their grave, and we must there to learn it.
      
      And that same day, too, gazing far down from his boat’s side into that
      same golden sea, Starbuck lowly murmured:—
      
      “Loveliness unfathomable, as ever lover saw in his young bride’s
      eye!—Tell me not of thy teeth-tiered sharks, and thy kidnapping
      cannibal ways. Let faith oust fact; let fancy oust memory; I look deep
      down and do believe.”
      
      And Stubb, fish-like, with sparkling scales, leaped up in that same
      golden light:—
      
      “I am Stubb, and Stubb has his history; but here Stubb takes oaths that
      he has always been jolly!”
      
      
      CHAPTER 115. The Pequod Meets The Bachelor.
      
      And jolly enough were the sights and the sounds that came bearing down
      before the wind, some few weeks after Ahab’s harpoon had been welded.
      
      It was a Nantucket ship, the Bachelor, which had just wedged in her
      last cask of oil, and bolted down her bursting hatches; and now, in
      glad holiday apparel, was joyously, though somewhat vain-gloriously,
      sailing round among the widely-separated ships on the ground, previous
      to pointing her prow for home.
      
      The three men at her mast-head wore long streamers of narrow red
      bunting at their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended,
      bottom down; and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long
      lower jaw of the last whale they had slain. Signals, ensigns, and jacks
      of all colours were flying from her rigging, on every side. Sideways
      lashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm;
      above which, in her top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender breakers of
      the same precious fluid; and nailed to her main truck was a brazen
      lamp.
      
      As was afterwards learned, the Bachelor had met with the most
      surprising success; all the more wonderful, for that while cruising in
      the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without
      securing a single fish. Not only had barrels of beef and bread been
      given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm, but additional
      supplemental casks had been bartered for, from the ships she had met;
      and these were stowed along the deck, and in the captain’s and
      officers’ state-rooms. Even the cabin table itself had been knocked
      into kindling-wood; and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an
      oil-butt, lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece. In the
      forecastle, the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests,
      and filled them; it was humorously added, that the cook had clapped a
      head on his largest boiler, and filled it; that the steward had plugged
      his spare coffee-pot and filled it; that the harpooneers had headed the
      sockets of their irons and filled them; that indeed everything was
      filled with sperm, except the captain’s pantaloons pockets, and those
      he reserved to thrust his hands into, in self-complacent testimony of
      his entire satisfaction.
      
      As this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody Pequod, the
      barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle; and drawing
      still nearer, a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge
      try-pots, which, covered with the parchment-like _poke_ or stomach skin
      of the black fish, gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the
      clenched hands of the crew. On the quarter-deck, the mates and
      harpooneers were dancing with the olive-hued girls who had eloped with
      them from the Polynesian Isles; while suspended in an ornamented boat,
      firmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast, three Long
      Island negroes, with glittering fiddle-bows of whale ivory, were
      presiding over the hilarious jig. Meanwhile, others of the ship’s
      company were tumultuously busy at the masonry of the try-works, from
      which the huge pots had been removed. You would have almost thought
      they were pulling down the cursed Bastille, such wild cries they
      raised, as the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the
      sea.
      
      Lord and master over all this scene, the captain stood erect on the
      ship’s elevated quarter-deck, so that the whole rejoicing drama was
      full before him, and seemed merely contrived for his own individual
      diversion.
      
      And Ahab, he too was standing on his quarter-deck, shaggy and black,
      with a stubborn gloom; and as the two ships crossed each other’s
      wakes—one all jubilations for things passed, the other all forebodings
      as to things to come—their two captains in themselves impersonated the
      whole striking contrast of the scene.
      
      “Come aboard, come aboard!” cried the gay Bachelor’s commander, lifting
      a glass and a bottle in the air.
      
      “Hast seen the White Whale?” gritted Ahab in reply.
      
      “No; only heard of him; but don’t believe in him at all,” said the
      other good-humoredly. “Come aboard!”
      
      “Thou art too damned jolly. Sail on. Hast lost any men?”
      
      “Not enough to speak of—two islanders, that’s all;—but come aboard, old
      hearty, come along. I’ll soon take that black from your brow. Come
      along, will ye (merry’s the play); a full ship and homeward-bound.”
      
      “How wondrous familiar is a fool!” muttered Ahab; then aloud, “Thou art
      a full ship and homeward bound, thou sayst; well, then, call me an
      empty ship, and outward-bound. So go thy ways, and I will mine. Forward
      there! Set all sail, and keep her to the wind!”
      
      And thus, while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze, the other
      stubbornly fought against it; and so the two vessels parted; the crew
      of the Pequod looking with grave, lingering glances towards the
      receding Bachelor; but the Bachelor’s men never heeding their gaze for
      the lively revelry they were in. And as Ahab, leaning over the
      taffrail, eyed the homeward-bound craft, he took from his pocket a
      small vial of sand, and then looking from the ship to the vial, seemed
      thereby bringing two remote associations together, for that vial was
      filled with Nantucket soundings.
      
      
      CHAPTER 116. The Dying Whale.
      
      Not seldom in this life, when, on the right side, fortune’s favourites
      sail close by us, we, though all adroop before, catch somewhat of the
      rushing breeze, and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out. So seemed
      it with the Pequod. For next day after encountering the gay Bachelor,
      whales were seen and four were slain; and one of them by Ahab.
      
      It was far down the afternoon; and when all the spearings of the
      crimson fight were done: and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky,
      sun and whale both stilly died together; then, such a sweetness and
      such plaintiveness, such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy
      air, that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent
      valleys of the Manilla isles, the Spanish land-breeze, wantonly turned
      sailor, had gone to sea, freighted with these vesper hymns.
      
      Soothed again, but only soothed to deeper gloom, Ahab, who had sterned
      off from the whale, sat intently watching his final wanings from the
      now tranquil boat. For that strange spectacle observable in all sperm
      whales dying—the turning sunwards of the head, and so expiring—that
      strange spectacle, beheld of such a placid evening, somehow to Ahab
      conveyed a wondrousness unknown before.
      
      “He turns and turns him to it,—how slowly, but how steadfastly, his
      homage-rendering and invoking brow, with his last dying motions. He too
      worships fire; most faithful, broad, baronial vassal of the sun!—Oh
      that these too-favouring eyes should see these too-favouring sights.
      Look! here, far water-locked; beyond all hum of human weal or woe; in
      these most candid and impartial seas; where to traditions no rocks
      furnish tablets; where for long Chinese ages, the billows have still
      rolled on speechless and unspoken to, as stars that shine upon the
      Niger’s unknown source; here, too, life dies sunwards full of faith;
      but see! no sooner dead, than death whirls round the corpse, and it
      heads some other way.
      
      “Oh, thou dark Hindoo half of nature, who of drowned bones hast builded
      thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured seas;
      thou art an infidel, thou queen, and too truly speakest to me in the
      wide-slaughtering Typhoon, and the hushed burial of its after calm. Nor
      has this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head, and then gone round
      again, without a lesson to me.
      
      “Oh, trebly hooped and welded hip of power! Oh, high aspiring,
      rainbowed jet!—that one strivest, this one jettest all in vain! In
      vain, oh whale, dost thou seek intercedings with yon all-quickening
      sun, that only calls forth life, but gives it not again. Yet dost thou,
      darker half, rock me with a prouder, if a darker faith. All thy
      unnamable imminglings float beneath me here; I am buoyed by breaths of
      once living things, exhaled as air, but water now.
      
      “Then hail, for ever hail, O sea, in whose eternal tossings the wild
      fowl finds his only rest. Born of earth, yet suckled by the sea; though
      hill and valley mothered me, ye billows are my foster-brothers!”
      
      
      CHAPTER 117. The Whale Watch.
      
      The four whales slain that evening had died wide apart; one, far to
      windward; one, less distant, to leeward; one ahead; one astern. These
      last three were brought alongside ere nightfall; but the windward one
      could not be reached till morning; and the boat that had killed it lay
      by its side all night; and that boat was Ahab’s.
      
      The waif-pole was thrust upright into the dead whale’s spout-hole; and
      the lantern hanging from its top, cast a troubled flickering glare upon
      the black, glossy back, and far out upon the midnight waves, which
      gently chafed the whale’s broad flank, like soft surf upon a beach.
      
      Ahab and all his boat’s crew seemed asleep but the Parsee; who
      crouching in the bow, sat watching the sharks, that spectrally played
      round the whale, and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails. A
      sound like the moaning in squadrons over Asphaltites of unforgiven
      ghosts of Gomorrah, ran shuddering through the air.
      
      Started from his slumbers, Ahab, face to face, saw the Parsee; and
      hooped round by the gloom of the night they seemed the last men in a
      flooded world. “I have dreamed it again,” said he.
      
      “Of the hearses? Have I not said, old man, that neither hearse nor
      coffin can be thine?”
      
      “And who are hearsed that die on the sea?”
      
      “But I said, old man, that ere thou couldst die on this voyage, two
      hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea; the first not made by
      mortal hands; and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in
      America.”
      
      “Aye, aye! a strange sight that, Parsee:—a hearse and its plumes
      floating over the ocean with the waves for the pall-bearers. Ha! Such a
      sight we shall not soon see.”
      
      “Believe it or not, thou canst not die till it be seen, old man.”
      
      “And what was that saying about thyself?”
      
      “Though it come to the last, I shall still go before thee thy pilot.”
      
      “And when thou art so gone before—if that ever befall—then ere I can
      follow, thou must still appear to me, to pilot me still?—Was it not so?
      Well, then, did I believe all ye say, oh my pilot! I have here two
      pledges that I shall yet slay Moby Dick and survive it.”
      
      “Take another pledge, old man,” said the Parsee, as his eyes lighted up
      like fire-flies in the gloom—“Hemp only can kill thee.”
      
      “The gallows, ye mean.—I am immortal then, on land and on sea,” cried
      Ahab, with a laugh of derision;—“Immortal on land and on sea!”
      
      Both were silent again, as one man. The grey dawn came on, and the
      slumbering crew arose from the boat’s bottom, and ere noon the dead
      whale was brought to the ship.
      
      
      CHAPTER 118. The Quadrant.
      
      The season for the Line at length drew near; and every day when Ahab,
      coming from his cabin, cast his eyes aloft, the vigilant helmsman would
      ostentatiously handle his spokes, and the eager mariners quickly run to
      the braces, and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed
      on the nailed doubloon; impatient for the order to point the ship’s
      prow for the equator. In good time the order came. It was hard upon
      high noon; and Ahab, seated in the bows of his high-hoisted boat, was
      about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his
      latitude.
      
      Now, in that Japanese sea, the days in summer are as freshets of
      effulgences. That unblinkingly vivid Japanese sun seems the blazing
      focus of the glassy ocean’s immeasurable burning-glass. The sky looks
      lacquered; clouds there are none; the horizon floats; and this
      nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of
      God’s throne. Well that Ahab’s quadrant was furnished with coloured
      glasses, through which to take sight of that solar fire. So, swinging
      his seated form to the roll of the ship, and with his
      astrological-looking instrument placed to his eye, he remained in that
      posture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun
      should gain its precise meridian. Meantime while his whole attention
      was absorbed, the Parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ship’s deck,
      and with face thrown up like Ahab’s, was eyeing the same sun with him;
      only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs, and his wild face was
      subdued to an earthly passionlessness. At length the desired
      observation was taken; and with his pencil upon his ivory leg, Ahab
      soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant. Then
      falling into a moment’s revery, he again looked up towards the sun and
      murmured to himself: “Thou sea-mark! thou high and mighty Pilot! thou
      tellest me truly where I _am_—but canst thou cast the least hint where
      I _shall_ be? Or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is
      this moment living? Where is Moby Dick? This instant thou must be
      eyeing him. These eyes of mine look into the very eye that is even now
      beholding him; aye, and into the eye that is even now equally beholding
      the objects on the unknown, thither side of thee, thou sun!”
      
      Then gazing at his quadrant, and handling, one after the other, its
      numerous cabalistical contrivances, he pondered again, and muttered:
      “Foolish toy! babies’ plaything of haughty Admirals, and Commodores,
      and Captains; the world brags of thee, of thy cunning and might; but
      what after all canst thou do, but tell the poor, pitiful point, where
      thou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet, and the hand that
      holds thee: no! not one jot more! Thou canst not tell where one drop of
      water or one grain of sand will be to-morrow noon; and yet with thy
      impotence thou insultest the sun! Science! Curse thee, thou vain toy;
      and cursed be all the things that cast man’s eyes aloft to that heaven,
      whose live vividness but scorches him, as these old eyes are even now
      scorched with thy light, O sun! Level by nature to this earth’s horizon
      are the glances of man’s eyes; not shot from the crown of his head, as
      if God had meant him to gaze on his firmament. Curse thee, thou
      quadrant!” dashing it to the deck, “no longer will I guide my earthly
      way by thee; the level ship’s compass, and the level dead-reckoning, by
      log and by line; _these_ shall conduct me, and show me my place on the
      sea. Aye,” lighting from the boat to the deck, “thus I trample on thee,
      thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high; thus I split and
      destroy thee!”
      
      As the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and
      dead feet, a sneering triumph that seemed meant for Ahab, and a
      fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himself—these passed over the
      mute, motionless Parsee’s face. Unobserved he rose and glided away;
      while, awestruck by the aspect of their commander, the seamen clustered
      together on the forecastle, till Ahab, troubledly pacing the deck,
      shouted out—“To the braces! Up helm!—square in!”
      
      In an instant the yards swung round; and as the ship half-wheeled upon
      her heel, her three firm-seated graceful masts erectly poised upon her
      long, ribbed hull, seemed as the three Horatii pirouetting on one
      sufficient steed.
      
      Standing between the knight-heads, Starbuck watched the Pequod’s
      tumultuous way, and Ahab’s also, as he went lurching along the deck.
      
      “I have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow, full
      of its tormented flaming life; and I have seen it wane at last, down,
      down, to dumbest dust. Old man of oceans! of all this fiery life of
      thine, what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes!”
      
      “Aye,” cried Stubb, “but sea-coal ashes—mind ye that, Mr.
      Starbuck—sea-coal, not your common charcoal. Well, well; I heard Ahab
      mutter, ‘Here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands of
      mine; swears that I must play them, and no others.’ And damn me, Ahab,
      but thou actest right; live in the game, and die in it!”
      
      
      CHAPTER 119. The Candles.
      
      Warmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs: the tiger of Bengal
      crouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure. Skies the most
      effulgent but basket the deadliest thunders: gorgeous Cuba knows
      tornadoes that never swept tame northern lands. So, too, it is, that in
      these resplendent Japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst of
      all storms, the Typhoon. It will sometimes burst from out that
      cloudless sky, like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town.
      
      Towards evening of that day, the Pequod was torn of her canvas, and
      bare-poled was left to fight a Typhoon which had struck her directly
      ahead. When darkness came on, sky and sea roared and split with the
      thunder, and blazed with the lightning, that showed the disabled masts
      fluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of the
      tempest had left for its after sport.
      
      Holding by a shroud, Starbuck was standing on the quarter-deck; at
      every flash of the lightning glancing aloft, to see what additional
      disaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there; while Stubb
      and Flask were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer
      lashing of the boats. But all their pains seemed naught. Though lifted
      to the very top of the cranes, the windward quarter boat (Ahab’s) did
      not escape. A great rolling sea, dashing high up against the reeling
      ship’s high teetering side, stove in the boat’s bottom at the stern,
      and left it again, all dripping through like a sieve.
      
      “Bad work, bad work! Mr. Starbuck,” said Stubb, regarding the wreck,
      “but the sea will have its way. Stubb, for one, can’t fight it. You
      see, Mr. Starbuck, a wave has such a great long start before it leaps,
      all round the world it runs, and then comes the spring! But as for me,
      all the start I have to meet it, is just across the deck here. But
      never mind; it’s all in fun: so the old song says;”—(_sings_.)
      
      
        Oh! jolly is the gale, And a joker is the whale, A’ flourishin’ his
        tail,— Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad, is the
        Ocean, oh!
      
        The scud all a flyin’, That’s his flip only foamin’; When he stirs in
        the spicin’,— Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad,
        is the Ocean, oh!
      
        Thunder splits the ships, But he only smacks his lips, A tastin’ of
        this flip,— Such a funny, sporty, gamy, jesty, joky, hoky-poky lad,
        is the Ocean, oh!
      
      
      
      “Avast Stubb,” cried Starbuck, “let the Typhoon sing, and strike his
      harp here in our rigging; but if thou art a brave man thou wilt hold
      thy peace.”
      
      “But I am not a brave man; never said I was a brave man; I am a coward;
      and I sing to keep up my spirits. And I tell you what it is, Mr.
      Starbuck, there’s no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my
      throat. And when that’s done, ten to one I sing ye the doxology for a
      wind-up.”
      
      “Madman! look through my eyes if thou hast none of thine own.”
      
      “What! how can you see better of a dark night than anybody else, never
      mind how foolish?”
      
      “Here!” cried Starbuck, seizing Stubb by the shoulder, and pointing his
      hand towards the weather bow, “markest thou not that the gale comes
      from the eastward, the very course Ahab is to run for Moby Dick? the
      very course he swung to this day noon? now mark his boat there; where
      is that stove? In the stern-sheets, man; where he is wont to stand—his
      stand-point is stove, man! Now jump overboard, and sing away, if thou
      must!
      
      “I don’t half understand ye: what’s in the wind?”
      
      “Yes, yes, round the Cape of Good Hope is the shortest way to
      Nantucket,” soliloquized Starbuck suddenly, heedless of Stubb’s
      question. “The gale that now hammers at us to stave us, we can turn it
      into a fair wind that will drive us towards home. Yonder, to windward,
      all is blackness of doom; but to leeward, homeward—I see it lightens up
      there; but not with the lightning.”
      
      At that moment in one of the intervals of profound darkness, following
      the flashes, a voice was heard at his side; and almost at the same
      instant a volley of thunder peals rolled overhead.
      
      “Who’s there?”
      
      “Old Thunder!” said Ahab, groping his way along the bulwarks to his
      pivot-hole; but suddenly finding his path made plain to him by elbowed
      lances of fire.
      
      Now, as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off
      the perilous fluid into the soil; so the kindred rod which at sea some
      ships carry to each mast, is intended to conduct it into the water. But
      as this conductor must descend to considerable depth, that its end may
      avoid all contact with the hull; and as moreover, if kept constantly
      towing there, it would be liable to many mishaps, besides interfering
      not a little with some of the rigging, and more or less impeding the
      vessel’s way in the water; because of all this, the lower parts of a
      ship’s lightning-rods are not always overboard; but are generally made
      in long slender links, so as to be the more readily hauled up into the
      chains outside, or thrown down into the sea, as occasion may require.
      
      “The rods! the rods!” cried Starbuck to the crew, suddenly admonished
      to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting
      flambeaux, to light Ahab to his post. “Are they overboard? drop them
      over, fore and aft. Quick!”
      
      “Avast!” cried Ahab; “let’s have fair play here, though we be the
      weaker side. Yet I’ll contribute to raise rods on the Himmalehs and
      Andes, that all the world may be secured; but out on privileges! Let
      them be, sir.”
      
      “Look aloft!” cried Starbuck. “The corpusants! the corpusants!”
      
      All the yard-arms were tipped with a pallid fire; and touched at each
      tri-pointed lightning-rod-end with three tapering white flames, each of
      the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air, like
      three gigantic wax tapers before an altar.
      
      “Blast the boat! let it go!” cried Stubb at this instant, as a swashing
      sea heaved up under his own little craft, so that its gunwale violently
      jammed his hand, as he was passing a lashing. “Blast it!”—but slipping
      backward on the deck, his uplifted eyes caught the flames; and
      immediately shifting his tone he cried—“The corpusants have mercy on us
      all!”
      
      To sailors, oaths are household words; they will swear in the trance of
      the calm, and in the teeth of the tempest; they will imprecate curses
      from the topsail-yard-arms, when most they teeter over to a seething
      sea; but in all my voyagings, seldom have I heard a common oath when
      God’s burning finger has been laid on the ship; when His “Mene, Mene,
      Tekel Upharsin” has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage.
      
      While this pallidness was burning aloft, few words were heard from the
      enchanted crew; who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle, all
      their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence, like a far away
      constellation of stars. Relieved against the ghostly light, the
      gigantic jet negro, Daggoo, loomed up to thrice his real stature, and
      seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come. The parted
      mouth of Tashtego revealed his shark-white teeth, which strangely
      gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants; while lit up by
      the preternatural light, Queequeg’s tattooing burned like Satanic blue
      flames on his body.
      
      The tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft; and once more
      the Pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall. A moment
      or two passed, when Starbuck, going forward, pushed against some one.
      It was Stubb. “What thinkest thou now, man; I heard thy cry; it was not
      the same in the song.”
      
      “No, no, it wasn’t; I said the corpusants have mercy on us all; and I
      hope they will, still. But do they only have mercy on long faces?—have
      they no bowels for a laugh? And look ye, Mr. Starbuck—but it’s too dark
      to look. Hear me, then: I take that mast-head flame we saw for a sign
      of good luck; for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be
      chock a’ block with sperm-oil, d’ye see; and so, all that sperm will
      work up into the masts, like sap in a tree. Yes, our three masts will
      yet be as three spermaceti candles—that’s the good promise we saw.”
      
      At that moment Starbuck caught sight of Stubb’s face slowly beginning
      to glimmer into sight. Glancing upwards, he cried: “See! see!” and once
      more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled
      supernaturalness in their pallor.
      
      “The corpusants have mercy on us all,” cried Stubb, again.
      
      At the base of the mainmast, full beneath the doubloon and the flame,
      the Parsee was kneeling in Ahab’s front, but with his head bowed away
      from him; while near by, from the arched and overhanging rigging, where
      they had just been engaged securing a spar, a number of the seamen,
      arrested by the glare, now cohered together, and hung pendulous, like a
      knot of numbed wasps from a drooping, orchard twig. In various
      enchanted attitudes, like the standing, or stepping, or running
      skeletons in Herculaneum, others remained rooted to the deck; but all
      their eyes upcast.
      
      “Aye, aye, men!” cried Ahab. “Look up at it; mark it well; the white
      flame but lights the way to the White Whale! Hand me those mainmast
      links there; I would fain feel this pulse, and let mine beat against
      it; blood against fire! So.”
      
      Then turning—the last link held fast in his left hand, he put his foot
      upon the Parsee; and with fixed upward eye, and high-flung right arm,
      he stood erect before the lofty tri-pointed trinity of flames.
      
      “Oh! thou clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as Persian
      once did worship, till in the sacramental act so burned by thee, that
      to this hour I bear the scar; I now know thee, thou clear spirit, and I
      now know that thy right worship is defiance. To neither love nor
      reverence wilt thou be kind; and e’en for hate thou canst but kill; and
      all are killed. No fearless fool now fronts thee. I own thy speechless,
      placeless power; but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will
      dispute its unconditional, unintegral mastery in me. In the midst of
      the personified impersonal, a personality stands here. Though but a
      point at best; whencesoe’er I came; wheresoe’er I go; yet while I
      earthly live, the queenly personality lives in me, and feels her royal
      rights. But war is pain, and hate is woe. Come in thy lowest form of
      love, and I will kneel and kiss thee; but at thy highest, come as mere
      supernal power; and though thou launchest navies of full-freighted
      worlds, there’s that in here that still remains indifferent. Oh, thou
      clear spirit, of thy fire thou madest me, and like a true child of
      fire, I breathe it back to thee.”
      
      [_Sudden, repeated flashes of lightning; the nine flames leap
      lengthwise to thrice their previous height; Ahab, with the rest, closes
      his eyes, his right hand pressed hard upon them._]
      
      “I own thy speechless, placeless power; said I not so? Nor was it wrung
      from me; nor do I now drop these links. Thou canst blind; but I can
      then grope. Thou canst consume; but I can then be ashes. Take the
      homage of these poor eyes, and shutter-hands. I would not take it. The
      lightning flashes through my skull; mine eye-balls ache and ache; my
      whole beaten brain seems as beheaded, and rolling on some stunning
      ground. Oh, oh! Yet blindfold, yet will I talk to thee. Light though
      thou be, thou leapest out of darkness; but I am darkness leaping out of
      light, leaping out of thee! The javelins cease; open eyes; see, or not?
      There burn the flames! Oh, thou magnanimous! now I do glory in my
      genealogy. But thou art but my fiery father; my sweet mother, I know
      not. Oh, cruel! what hast thou done with her? There lies my puzzle; but
      thine is greater. Thou knowest not how came ye, hence callest thyself
      unbegotten; certainly knowest not thy beginning, hence callest thyself
      unbegun. I know that of me, which thou knowest not of thyself, oh, thou
      omnipotent. There is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee, thou clear
      spirit, to whom all thy eternity is but time, all thy creativeness
      mechanical. Through thee, thy flaming self, my scorched eyes do dimly
      see it. Oh, thou foundling fire, thou hermit immemorial, thou too hast
      thy incommunicable riddle, thy unparticipated grief. Here again with
      haughty agony, I read my sire. Leap! leap up, and lick the sky! I leap
      with thee; I burn with thee; would fain be welded with thee; defyingly
      I worship thee!”
      
      “The boat! the boat!” cried Starbuck, “look at thy boat, old man!”
      
      Ahab’s harpoon, the one forged at Perth’s fire, remained firmly lashed
      in its conspicuous crotch, so that it projected beyond his whale-boat’s
      bow; but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather
      sheath to drop off; and from the keen steel barb there now came a
      levelled flame of pale, forked fire. As the silent harpoon burned there
      like a serpent’s tongue, Starbuck grasped Ahab by the arm—“God, God is
      against thee, old man; forbear! ’tis an ill voyage! ill begun, ill
      continued; let me square the yards, while we may, old man, and make a
      fair wind of it homewards, to go on a better voyage than this.”
      
      Overhearing Starbuck, the panic-stricken crew instantly ran to the
      braces—though not a sail was left aloft. For the moment all the aghast
      mate’s thoughts seemed theirs; they raised a half mutinous cry. But
      dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck, and snatching the
      burning harpoon, Ahab waved it like a torch among them; swearing to
      transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a rope’s end.
      Petrified by his aspect, and still more shrinking from the fiery dart
      that he held, the men fell back in dismay, and Ahab again spoke:—
      
      “All your oaths to hunt the White Whale are as binding as mine; and
      heart, soul, and body, lungs and life, old Ahab is bound. And that ye
      may know to what tune this heart beats; look ye here; thus I blow out
      the last fear!” And with one blast of his breath he extinguished the
      flame.
      
      As in the hurricane that sweeps the plain, men fly the neighborhood of
      some lone, gigantic elm, whose very height and strength but render it
      so much the more unsafe, because so much the more a mark for
      thunderbolts; so at those last words of Ahab’s many of the mariners did
      run from him in a terror of dismay.

      _Ahab standing by the helm. Starbuck approaching him._
      
      “We must send down the main-top-sail yard, sir. The band is working
      loose and the lee lift is half-stranded. Shall I strike it, sir?”
      
      “Strike nothing; lash it. If I had sky-sail poles, I’d sway them up
      now.”
      
      “Sir!—in God’s name!—sir?”
      
      “Well.”
      
      “The anchors are working, sir. Shall I get them inboard?”
      
      “Strike nothing, and stir nothing, but lash everything. The wind rises,
      but it has not got up to my table-lands yet. Quick, and see to it.—By
      masts and keels! he takes me for the hunch-backed skipper of some
      coasting smack. Send down my main-top-sail yard! Ho, gluepots! Loftiest
      trucks were made for wildest winds, and this brain-truck of mine now
      sails amid the cloud-scud. Shall I strike that? Oh, none but cowards
      send down their brain-trucks in tempest time. What a hooroosh aloft
      there! I would e’en take it for sublime, did I not know that the colic
      is a noisy malady. Oh, take medicine, take medicine!”
      
      
      CHAPTER 121. Midnight.—The Forecastle Bulwarks.
      
      _Stubb and Flask mounted on them, and passing additional lashings over
      the anchors there hanging._
      
      “No, Stubb; you may pound that knot there as much as you please, but
      you will never pound into me what you were just now saying. And how
      long ago is it since you said the very contrary? Didn’t you once say
      that whatever ship Ahab sails in, that ship should pay something extra
      on its insurance policy, just as though it were loaded with powder
      barrels aft and boxes of lucifers forward? Stop, now; didn’t you say
      so?”
      
      “Well, suppose I did? What then? I’ve part changed my flesh since that
      time, why not my mind? Besides, supposing we _are_ loaded with powder
      barrels aft and lucifers forward; how the devil could the lucifers get
      afire in this drenching spray here? Why, my little man, you have pretty
      red hair, but you couldn’t get afire now. Shake yourself; you’re
      Aquarius, or the water-bearer, Flask; might fill pitchers at your coat
      collar. Don’t you see, then, that for these extra risks the Marine
      Insurance companies have extra guarantees? Here are hydrants, Flask.
      But hark, again, and I’ll answer ye the other thing. First take your
      leg off from the crown of the anchor here, though, so I can pass the
      rope; now listen. What’s the mighty difference between holding a mast’s
      lightning-rod in the storm, and standing close by a mast that hasn’t
      got any lightning-rod at all in a storm? Don’t you see, you
      timber-head, that no harm can come to the holder of the rod, unless the
      mast is first struck? What are you talking about, then? Not one ship in
      a hundred carries rods, and Ahab,—aye, man, and all of us,—were in no
      more danger then, in my poor opinion, than all the crews in ten
      thousand ships now sailing the seas. Why, you King-Post, you, I suppose
      you would have every man in the world go about with a small
      lightning-rod running up the corner of his hat, like a militia
      officer’s skewered feather, and trailing behind like his sash. Why
      don’t ye be sensible, Flask? it’s easy to be sensible; why don’t ye,
      then? any man with half an eye can be sensible.”
      
      “I don’t know that, Stubb. You sometimes find it rather hard.”
      
      “Yes, when a fellow’s soaked through, it’s hard to be sensible, that’s
      a fact. And I am about drenched with this spray. Never mind; catch the
      turn there, and pass it. Seems to me we are lashing down these anchors
      now as if they were never going to be used again. Tying these two
      anchors here, Flask, seems like tying a man’s hands behind him. And
      what big generous hands they are, to be sure. These are your iron
      fists, hey? What a hold they have, too! I wonder, Flask, whether the
      world is anchored anywhere; if she is, she swings with an uncommon long
      cable, though. There, hammer that knot down, and we’ve done. So; next
      to touching land, lighting on deck is the most satisfactory. I say,
      just wring out my jacket skirts, will ye? Thank ye. They laugh at
      long-togs so, Flask; but seems to me, a long tailed coat ought always
      to be worn in all storms afloat. The tails tapering down that way,
      serve to carry off the water, d’ye see. Same with cocked hats; the
      cocks form gable-end eave-troughs, Flask. No more monkey-jackets and
      tarpaulins for me; I must mount a swallow-tail, and drive down a
      beaver; so. Halloa! whew! there goes my tarpaulin overboard; Lord,
      Lord, that the winds that come from heaven should be so unmannerly!
      This is a nasty night, lad.”

      During the most violent shocks of the Typhoon, the man at the Pequod’s
      jaw-bone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by
      its spasmodic motions, even though preventer tackles had been attached
      to it—for they were slack—because some play to the tiller was
      indispensable.
      
      In a severe gale like this, while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock
      to the blast, it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the
      compasses, at intervals, go round and round. It was thus with the
      Pequod’s; at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice
      the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards; it is a
      sight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted
      emotion.
      
      Some hours after midnight, the Typhoon abated so much, that through the
      strenuous exertions of Starbuck and Stubb—one engaged forward and the
      other aft—the shivered remnants of the jib and fore and main-top-sails
      were cut adrift from the spars, and went eddying away to leeward, like
      the feathers of an albatross, which sometimes are cast to the winds
      when that storm-tossed bird is on the wing.
      
      The three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed, and a
      storm-trysail was set further aft; so that the ship soon went through
      the water with some precision again; and the course—for the present,
      East-south-east—which he was to steer, if practicable, was once more
      given to the helmsman. For during the violence of the gale, he had only
      steered according to its vicissitudes. But as he was now bringing the
      ship as near her course as possible, watching the compass meanwhile,
      lo! a good sign! the wind seemed coming round astern; aye, the foul
      breeze became fair!
      
      Instantly the yards were squared, to the lively song of “_Ho! the fair
      wind! oh-ye-ho, cheerly men!_” the crew singing for joy, that so
      promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents
      preceding it.
      
      In compliance with the standing order of his commander—to report
      immediately, and at any one of the twenty-four hours, any decided
      change in the affairs of the deck,—Starbuck had no sooner trimmed the
      yards to the breeze—however reluctantly and gloomily,—than he
      mechanically went below to apprise Captain Ahab of the circumstance.
      
      Ere knocking at his state-room, he involuntarily paused before it a
      moment. The cabin lamp—taking long swings this way and that—was burning
      fitfully, and casting fitful shadows upon the old man’s bolted door,—a
      thin one, with fixed blinds inserted, in place of upper panels. The
      isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming silence
      to reign there, though it was hooped round by all the roar of the
      elements. The loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed, as
      they stood upright against the forward bulkhead. Starbuck was an
      honest, upright man; but out of Starbuck’s heart, at that instant when
      he saw the muskets, there strangely evolved an evil thought; but so
      blent with its neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he
      hardly knew it for itself.
      
      “He would have shot me once,” he murmured, “yes, there’s the very
      musket that he pointed at me;—that one with the studded stock; let me
      touch it—lift it. Strange, that I, who have handled so many deadly
      lances, strange, that I should shake so now. Loaded? I must see. Aye,
      aye; and powder in the pan;—that’s not good. Best spill it?—wait. I’ll
      cure myself of this. I’ll hold the musket boldly while I think.—I come
      to report a fair wind to him. But how fair? Fair for death and
      doom,—_that’s_ fair for Moby Dick. It’s a fair wind that’s only fair
      for that accursed fish.—The very tube he pointed at me!—the very one;
      _this_ one—I hold it here; he would have killed me with the very thing
      I handle now.—Aye and he would fain kill all his crew. Does he not say
      he will not strike his spars to any gale? Has he not dashed his
      heavenly quadrant? and in these same perilous seas, gropes he not his
      way by mere dead reckoning of the error-abounding log? and in this very
      Typhoon, did he not swear that he would have no lightning-rods? But
      shall this crazed old man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ship’s
      company down to doom with him?—Yes, it would make him the wilful
      murderer of thirty men and more, if this ship come to any deadly harm;
      and come to deadly harm, my soul swears this ship will, if Ahab have
      his way. If, then, he were this instant—put aside, that crime would not
      be his. Ha! is he muttering in his sleep? Yes, just there,—in there,
      he’s sleeping. Sleeping? aye, but still alive, and soon awake again. I
      can’t withstand thee, then, old man. Not reasoning; not remonstrance;
      not entreaty wilt thou hearken to; all this thou scornest. Flat
      obedience to thy own flat commands, this is all thou breathest. Aye,
      and say’st the men have vow’d thy vow; say’st all of us are Ahabs.
      Great God forbid!—But is there no other way? no lawful way?—Make him a
      prisoner to be taken home? What! hope to wrest this old man’s living
      power from his own living hands? Only a fool would try it. Say he were
      pinioned even; knotted all over with ropes and hawsers; chained down to
      ring-bolts on this cabin floor; he would be more hideous than a caged
      tiger, then. I could not endure the sight; could not possibly fly his
      howlings; all comfort, sleep itself, inestimable reason would leave me
      on the long intolerable voyage. What, then, remains? The land is
      hundreds of leagues away, and locked Japan the nearest. I stand alone
      here upon an open sea, with two oceans and a whole continent between me
      and law.—Aye, aye, ’tis so.—Is heaven a murderer when its lightning
      strikes a would-be murderer in his bed, tindering sheets and skin
      together?—And would I be a murderer, then, if”—and slowly, stealthily,
      and half sideways looking, he placed the loaded musket’s end against
      the door.
      
      “On this level, Ahab’s hammock swings within; his head this way. A
      touch, and Starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child again.—Oh
      Mary! Mary!—boy! boy! boy!—But if I wake thee not to death, old man,
      who can tell to what unsounded deeps Starbuck’s body this day week may
      sink, with all the crew! Great God, where art Thou? Shall I? shall
      I?—The wind has gone down and shifted, sir; the fore and main topsails
      are reefed and set; she heads her course.”
      
      “Stern all! Oh Moby Dick, I clutch thy heart at last!”
      
      Such were the sounds that now came hurtling from out the old man’s
      tormented sleep, as if Starbuck’s voice had caused the long dumb dream
      to speak.
      
      The yet levelled musket shook like a drunkard’s arm against the panel;
      Starbuck seemed wrestling with an angel; but turning from the door, he
      placed the death-tube in its rack, and left the place.
      
      “He’s too sound asleep, Mr. Stubb; go thou down, and wake him, and tell
      him. I must see to the deck here. Thou know’st what to say.”
      
      
      CHAPTER 124. The Needle.
      
      Next morning the not-yet-subsided sea rolled in long slow billows of
      mighty bulk, and striving in the Pequod’s gurgling track, pushed her on
      like giants’ palms outspread. The strong, unstaggering breeze abounded
      so, that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails; the whole world
      boomed before the wind. Muffled in the full morning light, the
      invisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place;
      where his bayonet rays moved on in stacks. Emblazonings, as of crowned
      Babylonian kings and queens, reigned over everything. The sea was as a
      crucible of molten gold, that bubblingly leaps with light and heat.
      
      Long maintaining an enchanted silence, Ahab stood apart; and every time
      the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit, he turned to
      eye the bright sun’s rays produced ahead; and when she profoundly
      settled by the stern, he turned behind, and saw the sun’s rearward
      place, and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating
      wake.
      
      “Ha, ha, my ship! thou mightest well be taken now for the sea-chariot
      of the sun. Ho, ho! all ye nations before my prow, I bring the sun to
      ye! Yoke on the further billows; hallo! a tandem, I drive the sea!”
      
      But suddenly reined back by some counter thought, he hurried towards
      the helm, huskily demanding how the ship was heading.
      
      “East-sou-east, sir,” said the frightened steersman.
      
      “Thou liest!” smiting him with his clenched fist. “Heading East at this
      hour in the morning, and the sun astern?”
      
      Upon this every soul was confounded; for the phenomenon just then
      observed by Ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else; but its very
      blinding palpableness must have been the cause.
      
      Thrusting his head half way into the binnacle, Ahab caught one glimpse
      of the compasses; his uplifted arm slowly fell; for a moment he almost
      seemed to stagger. Standing behind him Starbuck looked, and lo! the two
      compasses pointed East, and the Pequod was as infallibly going West.
      
      But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew, the
      old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed, “I have it! It has happened
      before. Mr. Starbuck, last night’s thunder turned our compasses—that’s
      all. Thou hast before now heard of such a thing, I take it.”
      
      “Aye; but never before has it happened to me, sir,” said the pale mate,
      gloomily.
      
      Here, it must needs be said, that accidents like this have in more than
      one case occurred to ships in violent storms. The magnetic energy, as
      developed in the mariner’s needle, is, as all know, essentially one
      with the electricity beheld in heaven; hence it is not to be much
      marvelled at, that such things should be. Instances where the lightning
      has actually struck the vessel, so as to smite down some of the spars
      and rigging, the effect upon the needle has at times been still more
      fatal; all its loadstone virtue being annihilated, so that the before
      magnetic steel was of no more use than an old wife’s knitting needle.
      But in either case, the needle never again, of itself, recovers the
      original virtue thus marred or lost; and if the binnacle compasses be
      affected, the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship;
      even were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson.
      
      Deliberately standing before the binnacle, and eyeing the transpointed
      compasses, the old man, with the sharp of his extended hand, now took
      the precise bearing of the sun, and satisfied that the needles were
      exactly inverted, shouted out his orders for the ship’s course to be
      changed accordingly. The yards were hard up; and once more the Pequod
      thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind, for the supposed fair
      one had only been juggling her.
      
      Meanwhile, whatever were his own secret thoughts, Starbuck said
      nothing, but quietly he issued all requisite orders; while Stubb and
      Flask—who in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his
      feelings—likewise unmurmuringly acquiesced. As for the men, though some
      of them lowly rumbled, their fear of Ahab was greater than their fear
      of Fate. But as ever before, the pagan harpooneers remained almost
      wholly unimpressed; or if impressed, it was only with a certain
      magnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible Ahab’s.
      
      For a space the old man walked the deck in rolling reveries. But
      chancing to slip with his ivory heel, he saw the crushed copper
      sight-tubes of the quadrant he had the day before dashed to the deck.
      
      “Thou poor, proud heaven-gazer and sun’s pilot! yesterday I wrecked
      thee, and to-day the compasses would fain have wrecked me. So, so. But
      Ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet. Mr. Starbuck—a lance without
      a pole; a top-maul, and the smallest of the sail-maker’s needles.
      Quick!”
      
      Accessory, perhaps, to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about
      to do, were certain prudential motives, whose object might have been to
      revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill, in a
      matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses. Besides, the old
      man well knew that to steer by transpointed needles, though clumsily
      practicable, was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious
      sailors, without some shudderings and evil portents.
      
      “Men,” said he, steadily turning upon the crew, as the mate handed him
      the things he had demanded, “my men, the thunder turned old Ahab’s
      needles; but out of this bit of steel Ahab can make one of his own,
      that will point as true as any.”
      
      Abashed glances of servile wonder were exchanged by the sailors, as
      this was said; and with fascinated eyes they awaited whatever magic
      might follow. But Starbuck looked away.
      
      With a blow from the top-maul Ahab knocked off the steel head of the
      lance, and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining, bade
      him hold it upright, without its touching the deck. Then, with the
      maul, after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod, he
      placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of it, and less strongly
      hammered that, several times, the mate still holding the rod as before.
      Then going through some small strange motions with it—whether
      indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel, or merely intended to
      augment the awe of the crew, is uncertain—he called for linen thread;
      and moving to the binnacle, slipped out the two reversed needles there,
      and horizontally suspended the sail-needle by its middle, over one of
      the compass-cards. At first, the steel went round and round, quivering
      and vibrating at either end; but at last it settled to its place, when
      Ahab, who had been intently watching for this result, stepped frankly
      back from the binnacle, and pointing his stretched arm towards it,
      exclaimed,—“Look ye, for yourselves, if Ahab be not lord of the level
      loadstone! The sun is East, and that compass swears it!”
      
      One after another they peered in, for nothing but their own eyes could
      persuade such ignorance as theirs, and one after another they slunk
      away.
      
      In his fiery eyes of scorn and triumph, you then saw Ahab in all his
      fatal pride.
      
      
      CHAPTER 125. The Log and Line.
      
      While now the fated Pequod had been so long afloat this voyage, the log
      and line had but very seldom been in use. Owing to a confident reliance
      upon other means of determining the vessel’s place, some merchantmen,
      and many whalemen, especially when cruising, wholly neglect to heave
      the log; though at the same time, and frequently more for form’s sake
      than anything else, regularly putting down upon the customary slate the
      course steered by the ship, as well as the presumed average rate of
      progression every hour. It had been thus with the Pequod. The wooden
      reel and angular log attached hung, long untouched, just beneath the
      railing of the after bulwarks. Rains and spray had damped it; sun and
      wind had warped it; all the elements had combined to rot a thing that
      hung so idly. But heedless of all this, his mood seized Ahab, as he
      happened to glance upon the reel, not many hours after the magnet
      scene, and he remembered how his quadrant was no more, and recalled his
      frantic oath about the level log and line. The ship was sailing
      plungingly; astern the billows rolled in riots.
      
      “Forward, there! Heave the log!”
      
      Two seamen came. The golden-hued Tahitian and the grizzly Manxman.
      “Take the reel, one of ye, I’ll heave.”
      
      They went towards the extreme stern, on the ship’s lee side, where the
      deck, with the oblique energy of the wind, was now almost dipping into
      the creamy, sidelong-rushing sea.
      
      The Manxman took the reel, and holding it high up, by the projecting
      handle-ends of the spindle, round which the spool of line revolved, so
      stood with the angular log hanging downwards, till Ahab advanced to
      him.
      
      Ahab stood before him, and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty
      turns to form a preliminary hand-coil to toss overboard, when the old
      Manxman, who was intently eyeing both him and the line, made bold to
      speak.
      
      “Sir, I mistrust it; this line looks far gone, long heat and wet have
      spoiled it.”
      
      “’Twill hold, old gentleman. Long heat and wet, have they spoiled thee?
      Thou seem’st to hold. Or, truer perhaps, life holds thee; not thou it.”
      
      “I hold the spool, sir. But just as my captain says. With these grey
      hairs of mine ’tis not worth while disputing, ’specially with a
      superior, who’ll ne’er confess.”
      
      “What’s that? There now’s a patched professor in Queen Nature’s
      granite-founded College; but methinks he’s too subservient. Where wert
      thou born?”
      
      “In the little rocky Isle of Man, sir.”
      
      “Excellent! Thou’st hit the world by that.”
      
      “I know not, sir, but I was born there.”
      
      “In the Isle of Man, hey? Well, the other way, it’s good. Here’s a man
      from Man; a man born in once independent Man, and now unmanned of Man;
      which is sucked in—by what? Up with the reel! The dead, blind wall
      butts all inquiring heads at last. Up with it! So.”
      
      The log was heaved. The loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long
      dragging line astern, and then, instantly, the reel began to whirl. In
      turn, jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows, the towing
      resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely.
      
      “Hold hard!”
      
      Snap! the overstrained line sagged down in one long festoon; the
      tugging log was gone.
      
      “I crush the quadrant, the thunder turns the needles, and now the mad
      sea parts the log-line. But Ahab can mend all. Haul in here, Tahitian;
      reel up, Manxman. And look ye, let the carpenter make another log, and
      mend thou the line. See to it.”
      
      “There he goes now; to him nothing’s happened; but to me, the skewer
      seems loosening out of the middle of the world. Haul in, haul in,
      Tahitian! These lines run whole, and whirling out: come in broken, and
      dragging slow. Ha, Pip? come to help; eh, Pip?”
      
      “Pip? whom call ye Pip? Pip jumped from the whale-boat. Pip’s missing.
      Let’s see now if ye haven’t fished him up here, fisherman. It drags
      hard; I guess he’s holding on. Jerk him, Tahiti! Jerk him off; we haul
      in no cowards here. Ho! there’s his arm just breaking water. A hatchet!
      a hatchet! cut it off—we haul in no cowards here. Captain Ahab! sir,
      sir! here’s Pip, trying to get on board again.”
      
      “Peace, thou crazy loon,” cried the Manxman, seizing him by the arm.
      “Away from the quarter-deck!”
      
      “The greater idiot ever scolds the lesser,” muttered Ahab, advancing.
      “Hands off from that holiness! Where sayest thou Pip was, boy?
      
      “Astern there, sir, astern! Lo! lo!”
      
      “And who art thou, boy? I see not my reflection in the vacant pupils of
      thy eyes. Oh God! that man should be a thing for immortal souls to
      sieve through! Who art thou, boy?”
      
      “Bell-boy, sir; ship’s-crier; ding, dong, ding! Pip! Pip! Pip! One
      hundred pounds of clay reward for Pip; five feet high—looks
      cowardly—quickest known by that! Ding, dong, ding! Who’s seen Pip the
      coward?”
      
      “There can be no hearts above the snow-line. Oh, ye frozen heavens!
      look down here. Ye did beget this luckless child, and have abandoned
      him, ye creative libertines. Here, boy; Ahab’s cabin shall be Pip’s
      home henceforth, while Ahab lives. Thou touchest my inmost centre, boy;
      thou art tied to me by cords woven of my heart-strings. Come, let’s
      down.”
      
      “What’s this? here’s velvet shark-skin,” intently gazing at Ahab’s
      hand, and feeling it. “Ah, now, had poor Pip but felt so kind a thing
      as this, perhaps he had ne’er been lost! This seems to me, sir, as a
      man-rope; something that weak souls may hold by. Oh, sir, let old Perth
      now come and rivet these two hands together; the black one with the
      white, for I will not let this go.”
      
      “Oh, boy, nor will I thee, unless I should thereby drag thee to worse
      horrors than are here. Come, then, to my cabin. Lo! ye believers in
      gods all goodness, and in man all ill, lo you! see the omniscient gods
      oblivious of suffering man; and man, though idiotic, and knowing not
      what he does, yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude. Come!
      I feel prouder leading thee by thy black hand, than though I grasped an
      Emperor’s!”
      
      “There go two daft ones now,” muttered the old Manxman. “One daft with
      strength, the other daft with weakness. But here’s the end of the
      rotten line—all dripping, too. Mend it, eh? I think we had best have a
      new line altogether. I’ll see Mr. Stubb about it.”
      
      
      CHAPTER 126. The Life-Buoy.
      
      Steering now south-eastward by Ahab’s levelled steel, and her progress
      solely determined by Ahab’s level log and line; the Pequod held on her
      path towards the Equator. Making so long a passage through such
      unfrequented waters, descrying no ships, and ere long, sideways
      impelled by unvarying trade winds, over waves monotonously mild; all
      these seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous and
      desperate scene.
      
      At last, when the ship drew near to the outskirts, as it were, of the
      Equatorial fishing-ground, and in the deep darkness that goes before
      the dawn, was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets; the watch—then
      headed by Flask—was startled by a cry so plaintively wild and
      unearthly—like half-articulated wailings of the ghosts of all Herod’s
      murdered Innocents—that one and all, they started from their reveries,
      and for the space of some moments stood, or sat, or leaned all
      transfixedly listening, like the carved Roman slave, while that wild
      cry remained within hearing. The Christian or civilized part of the
      crew said it was mermaids, and shuddered; but the pagan harpooneers
      remained unappalled. Yet the grey Manxman—the oldest mariner of
      all—declared that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard, were the
      voices of newly drowned men in the sea.
      
      Below in his hammock, Ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn, when he
      came to the deck; it was then recounted to him by Flask, not
      unaccompanied with hinted dark meanings. He hollowly laughed, and thus
      explained the wonder.
      
      Those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great
      numbers of seals, and some young seals that had lost their dams, or
      some dams that had lost their cubs, must have risen nigh the ship and
      kept company with her, crying and sobbing with their human sort of
      wail. But this only the more affected some of them, because most
      mariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals, arising not
      only from their peculiar tones when in distress, but also from the
      human look of their round heads and semi-intelligent faces, seen
      peeringly uprising from the water alongside. In the sea, under certain
      circumstances, seals have more than once been mistaken for men.
      
      But the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible
      confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning. At
      sun-rise this man went from his hammock to his mast-head at the fore;
      and whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep (for
      sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state), whether it was thus
      with the man, there is now no telling; but, be that as it may, he had
      not been long at his perch, when a cry was heard—a cry and a
      rushing—and looking up, they saw a falling phantom in the air; and
      looking down, a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the
      sea.
      
      The life-buoy—a long slender cask—was dropped from the stern, where it
      always hung obedient to a cunning spring; but no hand rose to seize it,
      and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken, so that it
      slowly filled, and that parched wood also filled at its every pore; and
      the studded iron-bound cask followed the sailor to the bottom, as if to
      yield him his pillow, though in sooth but a hard one.
      
      And thus the first man of the Pequod that mounted the mast to look out
      for the White Whale, on the White Whale’s own peculiar ground; that man
      was swallowed up in the deep. But few, perhaps, thought of that at the
      time. Indeed, in some sort, they were not grieved at this event, at
      least as a portent; for they regarded it, not as a foreshadowing of
      evil in the future, but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged.
      They declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they
      had heard the night before. But again the old Manxman said nay.
      
      The lost life-buoy was now to be replaced; Starbuck was directed to see
      to it; but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found, and as in
      the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the
      voyage, all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly
      connected with its final end, whatever that might prove to be;
      therefore, they were going to leave the ship’s stern unprovided with a
      buoy, when by certain strange signs and inuendoes Queequeg hinted a
      hint concerning his coffin.
      
      “A life-buoy of a coffin!” cried Starbuck, starting.
      
      “Rather queer, that, I should say,” said Stubb.
      
      “It will make a good enough one,” said Flask, “the carpenter here can
      arrange it easily.”
      
      “Bring it up; there’s nothing else for it,” said Starbuck, after a
      melancholy pause. “Rig it, carpenter; do not look at me so—the coffin,
      I mean. Dost thou hear me? Rig it.”
      
      “And shall I nail down the lid, sir?” moving his hand as with a hammer.
      
      “Aye.”
      
      “And shall I caulk the seams, sir?” moving his hand as with a
      caulking-iron.
      
      “Aye.”
      
      “And shall I then pay over the same with pitch, sir?” moving his hand
      as with a pitch-pot.
      
      “Away! what possesses thee to this? Make a life-buoy of the coffin, and
      no more.—Mr. Stubb, Mr. Flask, come forward with me.”
      
      “He goes off in a huff. The whole he can endure; at the parts he
      baulks. Now I don’t like this. I make a leg for Captain Ahab, and he
      wears it like a gentleman; but I make a bandbox for Queequeg, and he
      won’t put his head into it. Are all my pains to go for nothing with
      that coffin? And now I’m ordered to make a life-buoy of it. It’s like
      turning an old coat; going to bring the flesh on the other side now. I
      don’t like this cobbling sort of business—I don’t like it at all; it’s
      undignified; it’s not my place. Let tinkers’ brats do tinkerings; we
      are their betters. I like to take in hand none but clean, virgin,
      fair-and-square mathematical jobs, something that regularly begins at
      the beginning, and is at the middle when midway, and comes to an end at
      the conclusion; not a cobbler’s job, that’s at an end in the middle,
      and at the beginning at the end. It’s the old woman’s tricks to be
      giving cobbling jobs. Lord! what an affection all old women have for
      tinkers. I know an old woman of sixty-five who ran away with a
      bald-headed young tinker once. And that’s the reason I never would work
      for lonely widow old women ashore, when I kept my job-shop in the
      Vineyard; they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run
      off with me. But heigh-ho! there are no caps at sea but snow-caps. Let
      me see. Nail down the lid; caulk the seams; pay over the same with
      pitch; batten them down tight, and hang it with the snap-spring over
      the ship’s stern. Were ever such things done before with a coffin? Some
      superstitious old carpenters, now, would be tied up in the rigging, ere
      they would do the job. But I’m made of knotty Aroostook hemlock; I
      don’t budge. Cruppered with a coffin! Sailing about with a grave-yard
      tray! But never mind. We workers in woods make bridal-bedsteads and
      card-tables, as well as coffins and hearses. We work by the month, or
      by the job, or by the profit; not for us to ask the why and wherefore
      of our work, unless it be too confounded cobbling, and then we stash it
      if we can. Hem! I’ll do the job, now, tenderly. I’ll have me—let’s
      see—how many in the ship’s company, all told? But I’ve forgotten. Any
      way, I’ll have me thirty separate, Turk’s-headed life-lines, each three
      feet long hanging all round to the coffin. Then, if the hull go down,
      there’ll be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin, a sight
      not seen very often beneath the sun! Come hammer, caulking-iron,
      pitch-pot, and marling-spike! Let’s to it.”
      
      
      CHAPTER 127. The Deck.
      
      _The coffin laid upon two line-tubs, between the vice-bench and the
      open hatchway; the Carpenter caulking its seams; the string of twisted
      oakum slowly unwinding from a large roll of it placed in the bosom of
      his frock.—Ahab comes slowly from the cabin-gangway, and hears Pip
      following him._
      
      “Back, lad; I will be with ye again presently. He goes! Not this hand
      complies with my humor more genially than that boy.—Middle aisle of a
      church! What’s here?”
      
      “Life-buoy, sir. Mr. Starbuck’s orders. Oh, look, sir! Beware the
      hatchway!”
      
      “Thank ye, man. Thy coffin lies handy to the vault.”
      
      “Sir? The hatchway? oh! So it does, sir, so it does.”
      
      “Art not thou the leg-maker? Look, did not this stump come from thy
      shop?”
      
      “I believe it did, sir; does the ferrule stand, sir?”
      
      “Well enough. But art thou not also the undertaker?”
      
      “Aye, sir; I patched up this thing here as a coffin for Queequeg; but
      they’ve set me now to turning it into something else.”
      
      “Then tell me; art thou not an arrant, all-grasping, intermeddling,
      monopolising, heathenish old scamp, to be one day making legs, and the
      next day coffins to clap them in, and yet again life-buoys out of those
      same coffins? Thou art as unprincipled as the gods, and as much of a
      jack-of-all-trades.”
      
      “But I do not mean anything, sir. I do as I do.”
      
      “The gods again. Hark ye, dost thou not ever sing working about a
      coffin? The Titans, they say, hummed snatches when chipping out the
      craters for volcanoes; and the grave-digger in the play sings, spade in
      hand. Dost thou never?”
      
      “Sing, sir? Do I sing? Oh, I’m indifferent enough, sir, for that; but
      the reason why the grave-digger made music must have been because there
      was none in his spade, sir. But the caulking mallet is full of it. Hark
      to it.”
      
      “Aye, and that’s because the lid there’s a sounding-board; and what in
      all things makes the sounding-board is this—there’s naught beneath. And
      yet, a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same, Carpenter.
      Hast thou ever helped carry a bier, and heard the coffin knock against
      the churchyard gate, going in?
      
      “Faith, sir, I’ve——”
      
      “Faith? What’s that?”
      
      “Why, faith, sir, it’s only a sort of exclamation-like—that’s all,
      sir.”
      
      “Um, um; go on.”
      
      “I was about to say, sir, that——”
      
      “Art thou a silk-worm? Dost thou spin thy own shroud out of thyself?
      Look at thy bosom! Despatch! and get these traps out of sight.”
      
      “He goes aft. That was sudden, now; but squalls come sudden in hot
      latitudes. I’ve heard that the Isle of Albemarle, one of the
      Gallipagos, is cut by the Equator right in the middle. Seems to me some
      sort of Equator cuts yon old man, too, right in his middle. He’s always
      under the Line—fiery hot, I tell ye! He’s looking this way—come, oakum;
      quick. Here we go again. This wooden mallet is the cork, and I’m the
      professor of musical glasses—tap, tap!”
      
      (_Ahab to himself_.)
      
      “There’s a sight! There’s a sound! The greyheaded woodpecker tapping
      the hollow tree! Blind and dumb might well be envied now. See! that
      thing rests on two line-tubs, full of tow-lines. A most malicious wag,
      that fellow. Rat-tat! So man’s seconds tick! Oh! how immaterial are all
      materials! What things real are there, but imponderable thoughts? Here
      now’s the very dreaded symbol of grim death, by a mere hap, made the
      expressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered life. A
      life-buoy of a coffin! Does it go further? Can it be that in some
      spiritual sense the coffin is, after all, but an immortality-preserver!
      I’ll think of that. But no. So far gone am I in the dark side of earth,
      that its other side, the theoretic bright one, seems but uncertain
      twilight to me. Will ye never have done, Carpenter, with that accursed
      sound? I go below; let me not see that thing here when I return again.
      Now, then, Pip, we’ll talk this over; I do suck most wondrous
      philosophies from thee! Some unknown conduits from the unknown worlds
      must empty into thee!”
      
      
      CHAPTER 128. The Pequod Meets The Rachel.
      
      Next day, a large ship, the Rachel, was descried, bearing directly down
      upon the Pequod, all her spars thickly clustering with men. At the time
      the Pequod was making good speed through the water; but as the
      broad-winged windward stranger shot nigh to her, the boastful sails all
      fell together as blank bladders that are burst, and all life fled from
      the smitten hull.
      
      “Bad news; she brings bad news,” muttered the old Manxman. But ere her
      commander, who, with trumpet to mouth, stood up in his boat; ere he
      could hopefully hail, Ahab’s voice was heard.
      
      “Hast seen the White Whale?”
      
      “Aye, yesterday. Have ye seen a whale-boat adrift?”
      
      Throttling his joy, Ahab negatively answered this unexpected question;
      and would then have fain boarded the stranger, when the stranger
      captain himself, having stopped his vessel’s way, was seen descending
      her side. A few keen pulls, and his boat-hook soon clinched the
      Pequod’s main-chains, and he sprang to the deck. Immediately he was
      recognised by Ahab for a Nantucketer he knew. But no formal salutation
      was exchanged.
      
      “Where was he?—not killed!—not killed!” cried Ahab, closely advancing.
      “How was it?”
      
      It seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous,
      while three of the stranger’s boats were engaged with a shoal of
      whales, which had led them some four or five miles from the ship; and
      while they were yet in swift chase to windward, the white hump and head
      of Moby Dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water, not very far to
      leeward; whereupon, the fourth rigged boat—a reserved one—had been
      instantly lowered in chase. After a keen sail before the wind, this
      fourth boat—the swiftest keeled of all—seemed to have succeeded in
      fastening—at least, as well as the man at the mast-head could tell
      anything about it. In the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat;
      and then a swift gleam of bubbling white water; and after that nothing
      more; whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have
      indefinitely run away with his pursuers, as often happens. There was
      some apprehension, but no positive alarm, as yet. The recall signals
      were placed in the rigging; darkness came on; and forced to pick up her
      three far to windward boats—ere going in quest of the fourth one in the
      precisely opposite direction—the ship had not only been necessitated to
      leave that boat to its fate till near midnight, but, for the time, to
      increase her distance from it. But the rest of her crew being at last
      safe aboard, she crowded all sail—stunsail on stunsail—after the
      missing boat; kindling a fire in her try-pots for a beacon; and every
      other man aloft on the look-out. But though when she had thus sailed a
      sufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the absent ones when
      last seen; though she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all
      around her; and not finding anything, had again dashed on; again
      paused, and lowered her boats; and though she had thus continued doing
      till daylight; yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been
      seen.
      
      The story told, the stranger Captain immediately went on to reveal his
      object in boarding the Pequod. He desired that ship to unite with his
      own in the search; by sailing over the sea some four or five miles
      apart, on parallel lines, and so sweeping a double horizon, as it were.
      
      “I will wager something now,” whispered Stubb to Flask, “that some one
      in that missing boat wore off that Captain’s best coat; mayhap, his
      watch—he’s so cursed anxious to get it back. Who ever heard of two
      pious whale-ships cruising after one missing whale-boat in the height
      of the whaling season? See, Flask, only see how pale he looks—pale in
      the very buttons of his eyes—look—it wasn’t the coat—it must have been
      the—”
      
      “My boy, my own boy is among them. For God’s sake—I beg, I
      conjure”—here exclaimed the stranger Captain to Ahab, who thus far had
      but icily received his petition. “For eight-and-forty hours let me
      charter your ship—I will gladly pay for it, and roundly pay for it—if
      there be no other way—for eight-and-forty hours only—only that—you
      must, oh, you must, and you _shall_ do this thing.”
      
      “His son!” cried Stubb, “oh, it’s his son he’s lost! I take back the
      coat and watch—what says Ahab? We must save that boy.”
      
      “He’s drowned with the rest on ’em, last night,” said the old Manx
      sailor standing behind them; “I heard; all of ye heard their spirits.”
      
      Now, as it shortly turned out, what made this incident of the Rachel’s
      the more melancholy, was the circumstance, that not only was one of the
      Captain’s sons among the number of the missing boat’s crew; but among
      the number of the other boat’s crews, at the same time, but on the
      other hand, separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the
      chase, there had been still another son; as that for a time, the
      wretched father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity;
      which was only solved for him by his chief mate’s instinctively
      adopting the ordinary procedure of a whale-ship in such emergencies,
      that is, when placed between jeopardized but divided boats, always to
      pick up the majority first. But the captain, for some unknown
      constitutional reason, had refrained from mentioning all this, and not
      till forced to it by Ahab’s iciness did he allude to his one yet
      missing boy; a little lad, but twelve years old, whose father with the
      earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a Nantucketer’s paternal love, had
      thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a
      vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race. Nor does it
      unfrequently occur, that Nantucket captains will send a son of such
      tender age away from them, for a protracted three or four years’ voyage
      in some other ship than their own; so that their first knowledge of a
      whaleman’s career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a
      father’s natural but untimely partiality, or undue apprehensiveness and
      concern.
      
      Meantime, now the stranger was still beseeching his poor boon of Ahab;
      and Ahab still stood like an anvil, receiving every shock, but without
      the least quivering of his own.
      
      “I will not go,” said the stranger, “till you say _aye_ to me. Do to me
      as you would have me do to you in the like case. For _you_ too have a
      boy, Captain Ahab—though but a child, and nestling safely at home now—a
      child of your old age too—Yes, yes, you relent; I see it—run, run, men,
      now, and stand by to square in the yards.”
      
      “Avast,” cried Ahab—“touch not a rope-yarn”; then in a voice that
      prolongingly moulded every word—“Captain Gardiner, I will not do it.
      Even now I lose time. Good-bye, good-bye. God bless ye, man, and may I
      forgive myself, but I must go. Mr. Starbuck, look at the binnacle
      watch, and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all
      strangers: then brace forward again, and let the ship sail as before.”
      
      Hurriedly turning, with averted face, he descended into his cabin,
      leaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter
      rejection of his so earnest suit. But starting from his enchantment,
      Gardiner silently hurried to the side; more fell than stepped into his
      boat, and returned to his ship.
      
      Soon the two ships diverged their wakes; and long as the strange vessel
      was in view, she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot,
      however small, on the sea. This way and that her yards were swung
      round; starboard and larboard, she continued to tack; now she beat
      against a head sea; and again it pushed her before it; while all the
      while, her masts and yards were thickly clustered with men, as three
      tall cherry trees, when the boys are cherrying among the boughs.
      
      But by her still halting course and winding, woeful way, you plainly
      saw that this ship that so wept with spray, still remained without
      comfort. She was Rachel, weeping for her children, because they were
      not.
      
      
      CHAPTER 129. The Cabin.
      
      (_Ahab moving to go on deck; Pip catches him by the hand to follow._)
      
      “Lad, lad, I tell thee thou must not follow Ahab now. The hour is
      coming when Ahab would not scare thee from him, yet would not have thee
      by him. There is that in thee, poor lad, which I feel too curing to my
      malady. Like cures like; and for this hunt, my malady becomes my most
      desired health. Do thou abide below here, where they shall serve thee,
      as if thou wert the captain. Aye, lad, thou shalt sit here in my own
      screwed chair; another screw to it, thou must be.”
      
      “No, no, no! ye have not a whole body, sir; do ye but use poor me for
      your one lost leg; only tread upon me, sir; I ask no more, so I remain
      a part of ye.”
      
      “Oh! spite of million villains, this makes me a bigot in the fadeless
      fidelity of man!—and a black! and crazy!—but methinks like-cures-like
      applies to him too; he grows so sane again.”
      
      “They tell me, sir, that Stubb did once desert poor little Pip, whose
      drowned bones now show white, for all the blackness of his living skin.
      But I will never desert ye, sir, as Stubb did him. Sir, I must go with
      ye.”
      
      “If thou speakest thus to me much more, Ahab’s purpose keels up in him.
      I tell thee no; it cannot be.”
      
      “Oh good master, master, master!
      
      “Weep so, and I will murder thee! have a care, for Ahab too is mad.
      Listen, and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck, and still
      know that I am there. And now I quit thee. Thy hand!—Met! True art
      thou, lad, as the circumference to its centre. So: God for ever bless
      thee; and if it come to that,—God for ever save thee, let what will
      befall.”
      
      (_Ahab goes; Pip steps one step forward._)
      
      “Here he this instant stood; I stand in his air,—but I’m alone. Now
      were even poor Pip here I could endure it, but he’s missing. Pip! Pip!
      Ding, dong, ding! Who’s seen Pip? He must be up here; let’s try the
      door. What? neither lock, nor bolt, nor bar; and yet there’s no opening
      it. It must be the spell; he told me to stay here: Aye, and told me
      this screwed chair was mine. Here, then, I’ll seat me, against the
      transom, in the ship’s full middle, all her keel and her three masts
      before me. Here, our old sailors say, in their black seventy-fours
      great admirals sometimes sit at table, and lord it over rows of
      captains and lieutenants. Ha! what’s this? epaulets! epaulets! the
      epaulets all come crowding! Pass round the decanters; glad to see ye;
      fill up, monsieurs! What an odd feeling, now, when a black boy’s host
      to white men with gold lace upon their coats!—Monsieurs, have ye seen
      one Pip?—a little negro lad, five feet high, hang-dog look, and
      cowardly! Jumped from a whale-boat once;—seen him? No! Well then, fill
      up again, captains, and let’s drink shame upon all cowards! I name no
      names. Shame upon them! Put one foot upon the table. Shame upon all
      cowards.—Hist! above there, I hear ivory—Oh, master! master! I am
      indeed down-hearted when you walk over me. But here I’ll stay, though
      this stern strikes rocks; and they bulge through; and oysters come to
      join me.”
      
      
      CHAPTER 130. The Hat.
      
      And now that at the proper time and place, after so long and wide a
      preliminary cruise, Ahab,—all other whaling waters swept—seemed to have
      chased his foe into an ocean-fold, to slay him the more securely there;
      now, that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude
      where his tormenting wound had been inflicted; now that a vessel had
      been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually encountered
      Moby Dick;—and now that all his successive meetings with various ships
      contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference with which
      the white whale tore his hunters, whether sinning or sinned against;
      now it was that there lurked a something in the old man’s eyes, which
      it was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see. As the unsetting
      polar star, which through the livelong, arctic, six months’ night
      sustains its piercing, steady, central gaze; so Ahab’s purpose now
      fixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew. It
      domineered above them so, that all their bodings, doubts, misgivings,
      fears, were fain to hide beneath their souls, and not sprout forth a
      single spear or leaf.
      
      In this foreshadowing interval too, all humor, forced or natural,
      vanished. Stubb no more strove to raise a smile; Starbuck no more
      strove to check one. Alike, joy and sorrow, hope and fear, seemed
      ground to finest dust, and powdered, for the time, in the clamped
      mortar of Ahab’s iron soul. Like machines, they dumbly moved about the
      deck, ever conscious that the old man’s despot eye was on them.
      
      But did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours; when
      he thought no glance but one was on him; then you would have seen that
      even as Ahab’s eyes so awed the crew’s, the inscrutable Parsee’s glance
      awed his; or somehow, at least, in some wild way, at times affected it.
      Such an added, gliding strangeness began to invest the thin Fedallah
      now; such ceaseless shudderings shook him; that the men looked dubious
      at him; half uncertain, as it seemed, whether indeed he were a mortal
      substance, or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen
      being’s body. And that shadow was always hovering there. For not by
      night, even, had Fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber, or go
      below. He would stand still for hours: but never sat or leaned; his wan
      but wondrous eyes did plainly say—We two watchmen never rest.
      
      Nor, at any time, by night or day could the mariners now step upon the
      deck, unless Ahab was before them; either standing in his pivot-hole,
      or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limits,—the
      main-mast and the mizen; or else they saw him standing in the
      cabin-scuttle,—his living foot advanced upon the deck, as if to step;
      his hat slouched heavily over his eyes; so that however motionless he
      stood, however the days and nights were added on, that he had not swung
      in his hammock; yet hidden beneath that slouching hat, they could never
      tell unerringly whether, for all this, his eyes were really closed at
      times; or whether he was still intently scanning them; no matter,
      though he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch, and
      the unheeded night-damp gathered in beads of dew upon that stone-carved
      coat and hat. The clothes that the night had wet, the next day’s
      sunshine dried upon him; and so, day after day, and night after night;
      he went no more beneath the planks; whatever he wanted from the cabin
      that thing he sent for.
      
      He ate in the same open air; that is, his two only meals,—breakfast and
      dinner: supper he never touched; nor reaped his beard; which darkly
      grew all gnarled, as unearthed roots of trees blown over, which still
      grow idly on at naked base, though perished in the upper verdure. But
      though his whole life was now become one watch on deck; and though the
      Parsee’s mystic watch was without intermission as his own; yet these
      two never seemed to speak—one man to the other—unless at long intervals
      some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary. Though such a potent
      spell seemed secretly to join the twain; openly, and to the awe-struck
      crew, they seemed pole-like asunder. If by day they chanced to speak
      one word; by night, dumb men were both, so far as concerned the
      slightest verbal interchange. At times, for longest hours, without a
      single hail, they stood far parted in the starlight; Ahab in his
      scuttle, the Parsee by the mainmast; but still fixedly gazing upon each
      other; as if in the Parsee Ahab saw his forethrown shadow, in Ahab the
      Parsee his abandoned substance.
      
      And yet, somehow, did Ahab—in his own proper self, as daily, hourly,
      and every instant, commandingly revealed to his subordinates,—Ahab
      seemed an independent lord; the Parsee but his slave. Still again both
      seemed yoked together, and an unseen tyrant driving them; the lean
      shade siding the solid rib. For be this Parsee what he may, all rib and
      keel was solid Ahab.
      
      At the first faintest glimmering of the dawn, his iron voice was heard
      from aft,—“Man the mast-heads!”—and all through the day, till after
      sunset and after twilight, the same voice every hour, at the striking
      of the helmsman’s bell, was heard—“What d’ye see?—sharp! sharp!”
      
      But when three or four days had slided by, after meeting the
      children-seeking Rachel; and no spout had yet been seen; the monomaniac
      old man seemed distrustful of his crew’s fidelity; at least, of nearly
      all except the Pagan harpooneers; he seemed to doubt, even, whether
      Stubb and Flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought. But
      if these suspicions were really his, he sagaciously refrained from
      verbally expressing them, however his actions might seem to hint them.
      
      “I will have the first sight of the whale myself,”—he said. “Aye! Ahab
      must have the doubloon!” and with his own hands he rigged a nest of
      basketed bowlines; and sending a hand aloft, with a single sheaved
      block, to secure to the main-mast head, he received the two ends of the
      downward-reeved rope; and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin
      for the other end, in order to fasten it at the rail. This done, with
      that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin, he looked round
      upon his crew, sweeping from one to the other; pausing his glance long
      upon Daggoo, Queequeg, Tashtego; but shunning Fedallah; and then
      settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate, said,—“Take the
      rope, sir—I give it into thy hands, Starbuck.” Then arranging his
      person in the basket, he gave the word for them to hoist him to his
      perch, Starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last; and
      afterwards stood near it. And thus, with one hand clinging round the
      royal mast, Ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and miles,—ahead,
      astern, this side, and that,—within the wide expanded circle commanded
      at so great a height.
      
      When in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in
      the rigging, which chances to afford no foothold, the sailor at sea is
      hoisted up to that spot, and sustained there by the rope; under these
      circumstances, its fastened end on deck is always given in strict
      charge to some one man who has the special watch of it. Because in such
      a wilderness of running rigging, whose various different relations
      aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at
      the deck; and when the deck-ends of these ropes are being every few
      minutes cast down from the fastenings, it would be but a natural
      fatality, if, unprovided with a constant watchman, the hoisted sailor
      should by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all
      swooping to the sea. So Ahab’s proceedings in this matter were not
      unusual; the only strange thing about them seemed to be, that Starbuck,
      almost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with
      anything in the slightest degree approaching to decision—one of those
      too, whose faithfulness on the look-out he had seemed to doubt
      somewhat;—it was strange, that this was the very man he should select
      for his watchman; freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise
      distrusted person’s hands.
      
      Now, the first time Ahab was perched aloft; ere he had been there ten
      minutes; one of those red-billed savage sea-hawks which so often fly
      incommodiously close round the manned mast-heads of whalemen in these
      latitudes; one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his
      head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings. Then it darted a
      thousand feet straight up into the air; then spiralized downwards, and
      went eddying again round his head.
      
      But with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon, Ahab seemed
      not to mark this wild bird; nor, indeed, would any one else have marked
      it much, it being no uncommon circumstance; only now almost the least
      heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every
      sight.
      
      “Your hat, your hat, sir!” suddenly cried the Sicilian seaman, who
      being posted at the mizen-mast-head, stood directly behind Ahab, though
      somewhat lower than his level, and with a deep gulf of air dividing
      them.
      
      But already the sable wing was before the old man’s eyes; the long
      hooked bill at his head: with a scream, the black hawk darted away with
      his prize.
      
      An eagle flew thrice round Tarquin’s head, removing his cap to replace
      it, and thereupon Tanaquil, his wife, declared that Tarquin would be
      king of Rome. But only by the replacing of the cap was that omen
      accounted good. Ahab’s hat was never restored; the wild hawk flew on
      and on with it; far in advance of the prow: and at last disappeared;
      while from the point of that disappearance, a minute black spot was
      dimly discerned, falling from that vast height into the sea.
      
      
      CHAPTER 131. The Pequod Meets The Delight.
      
      The intense Pequod sailed on; the rolling waves and days went by; the
      life-buoy-coffin still lightly swung; and another ship, most miserably
      misnamed the Delight, was descried. As she drew nigh, all eyes were
      fixed upon her broad beams, called shears, which, in some
      whaling-ships, cross the quarter-deck at the height of eight or nine
      feet; serving to carry the spare, unrigged, or disabled boats.
      
      Upon the stranger’s shears were beheld the shattered, white ribs, and
      some few splintered planks, of what had once been a whale-boat; but you
      now saw through this wreck, as plainly as you see through the peeled,
      half-unhinged, and bleaching skeleton of a horse.
      
      “Hast seen the White Whale?”
      
      “Look!” replied the hollow-cheeked captain from his taffrail; and with
      his trumpet he pointed to the wreck.
      
      “Hast killed him?”
      
      “The harpoon is not yet forged that ever will do that,” answered the
      other, sadly glancing upon a rounded hammock on the deck, whose
      gathered sides some noiseless sailors were busy in sewing together.
      
      “Not forged!” and snatching Perth’s levelled iron from the crotch, Ahab
      held it out, exclaiming—“Look ye, Nantucketer; here in this hand I hold
      his death! Tempered in blood, and tempered by lightning are these
      barbs; and I swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the
      fin, where the White Whale most feels his accursed life!”
      
      “Then God keep thee, old man—see’st thou that”—pointing to the
      hammock—“I bury but one of five stout men, who were alive only
      yesterday; but were dead ere night. Only _that_ one I bury; the rest
      were buried before they died; you sail upon their tomb.” Then turning
      to his crew—“Are ye ready there? place the plank then on the rail, and
      lift the body; so, then—Oh! God”—advancing towards the hammock with
      uplifted hands—“may the resurrection and the life——”
      
      “Brace forward! Up helm!” cried Ahab like lightning to his men.
      
      But the suddenly started Pequod was not quick enough to escape the
      sound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea; not
      so quick, indeed, but that some of the flying bubbles might have
      sprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism.
      
      As Ahab now glided from the dejected Delight, the strange life-buoy
      hanging at the Pequod’s stern came into conspicuous relief.
      
      “Ha! yonder! look yonder, men!” cried a foreboding voice in her wake.
      “In vain, oh, ye strangers, ye fly our sad burial; ye but turn us your
      taffrail to show us your coffin!”
      
      
      CHAPTER 132. The Symphony.
      
      It was a clear steel-blue day. The firmaments of air and sea were
      hardly separable in that all-pervading azure; only, the pensive air was
      transparently pure and soft, with a woman’s look, and the robust and
      man-like sea heaved with long, strong, lingering swells, as Samson’s
      chest in his sleep.
      
      Hither, and thither, on high, glided the snow-white wings of small,
      unspeckled birds; these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air;
      but to and fro in the deeps, far down in the bottomless blue, rushed
      mighty leviathans, sword-fish, and sharks; and these were the strong,
      troubled, murderous thinkings of the masculine sea.
      
      But though thus contrasting within, the contrast was only in shades and
      shadows without; those two seemed one; it was only the sex, as it were,
      that distinguished them.
      
      Aloft, like a royal czar and king, the sun seemed giving this gentle
      air to this bold and rolling sea; even as bride to groom. And at the
      girdling line of the horizon, a soft and tremulous motion—most seen
      here at the equator—denoted the fond, throbbing trust, the loving
      alarms, with which the poor bride gave her bosom away.
      
      Tied up and twisted; gnarled and knotted with wrinkles; haggardly firm
      and unyielding; his eyes glowing like coals, that still glow in the
      ashes of ruin; untottering Ahab stood forth in the clearness of the
      morn; lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girl’s
      forehead of heaven.
      
      Oh, immortal infancy, and innocency of the azure! Invisible winged
      creatures that frolic all round us! Sweet childhood of air and sky! how
      oblivious were ye of old Ahab’s close-coiled woe! But so have I seen
      little Miriam and Martha, laughing-eyed elves, heedlessly gambol around
      their old sire; sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on
      the marge of that burnt-out crater of his brain.
      
      Slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle, Ahab leaned over the side
      and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze, the
      more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity. But the
      lovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel, for a
      moment, the cankerous thing in his soul. That glad, happy air, that
      winsome sky, did at last stroke and caress him; the step-mother world,
      so long cruel—forbidding—now threw affectionate arms round his stubborn
      neck, and did seem to joyously sob over him, as if over one, that
      however wilful and erring, she could yet find it in her heart to save
      and to bless. From beneath his slouched hat Ahab dropped a tear into
      the sea; nor did all the Pacific contain such wealth as that one wee
      drop.
      
      Starbuck saw the old man; saw him, how he heavily leaned over the side;
      and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing
      that stole out of the centre of the serenity around. Careful not to
      touch him, or be noticed by him, he yet drew near to him, and stood
      there.
      
      Ahab turned.
      
      “Starbuck!”
      
      “Sir.”
      
      “Oh, Starbuck! it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky. On such
      a day—very much such a sweetness as this—I struck my first whale—a
      boy-harpooneer of eighteen! Forty—forty—forty years ago!—ago! Forty
      years of continual whaling! forty years of privation, and peril, and
      storm-time! forty years on the pitiless sea! for forty years has Ahab
      forsaken the peaceful land, for forty years to make war on the horrors
      of the deep! Aye and yes, Starbuck, out of those forty years I have not
      spent three ashore. When I think of this life I have led; the
      desolation of solitude it has been; the masoned, walled-town of a
      Captain’s exclusiveness, which admits but small entrance to any
      sympathy from the green country without—oh, weariness! heaviness!
      Guinea-coast slavery of solitary command!—when I think of all this;
      only half-suspected, not so keenly known to me before—and how for forty
      years I have fed upon dry salted fare—fit emblem of the dry nourishment
      of my soil!—when the poorest landsman has had fresh fruit to his daily
      hand, and broken the world’s fresh bread to my mouldy crusts—away,
      whole oceans away, from that young girl-wife I wedded past fifty, and
      sailed for Cape Horn the next day, leaving but one dent in my marriage
      pillow—wife? wife?—rather a widow with her husband alive! Aye, I
      widowed that poor girl when I married her, Starbuck; and then, the
      madness, the frenzy, the boiling blood and the smoking brow, with
      which, for a thousand lowerings old Ahab has furiously, foamingly
      chased his prey—more a demon than a man!—aye, aye! what a forty years’
      fool—fool—old fool, has old Ahab been! Why this strife of the chase?
      why weary, and palsy the arm at the oar, and the iron, and the lance?
      how the richer or better is Ahab now? Behold. Oh, Starbuck! is it not
      hard, that with this weary load I bear, one poor leg should have been
      snatched from under me? Here, brush this old hair aside; it blinds me,
      that I seem to weep. Locks so grey did never grow but from out some
      ashes! But do I look very old, so very, very old, Starbuck? I feel
      deadly faint, bowed, and humped, as though I were Adam, staggering
      beneath the piled centuries since Paradise. God! God! God!—crack my
      heart!—stave my brain!—mockery! mockery! bitter, biting mockery of grey
      hairs, have I lived enough joy to wear ye; and seem and feel thus
      intolerably old? Close! stand close to me, Starbuck; let me look into a
      human eye; it is better than to gaze into sea or sky; better than to
      gaze upon God. By the green land; by the bright hearth-stone! this is
      the magic glass, man; I see my wife and my child in thine eye. No, no;
      stay on board, on board!—lower not when I do; when branded Ahab gives
      chase to Moby Dick. That hazard shall not be thine. No, no! not with
      the far away home I see in that eye!”
      
      “Oh, my Captain! my Captain! noble soul! grand old heart, after all!
      why should any one give chase to that hated fish! Away with me! let us
      fly these deadly waters! let us home! Wife and child, too, are
      Starbuck’s—wife and child of his brotherly, sisterly, play-fellow
      youth; even as thine, sir, are the wife and child of thy loving,
      longing, paternal old age! Away! let us away!—this instant let me alter
      the course! How cheerily, how hilariously, O my Captain, would we bowl
      on our way to see old Nantucket again! I think, sir, they have some
      such mild blue days, even as this, in Nantucket.”
      
      “They have, they have. I have seen them—some summer days in the
      morning. About this time—yes, it is his noon nap now—the boy
      vivaciously wakes; sits up in bed; and his mother tells him of me, of
      cannibal old me; how I am abroad upon the deep, but will yet come back
      to dance him again.”
      
      “’Tis my Mary, my Mary herself! She promised that my boy, every
      morning, should be carried to the hill to catch the first glimpse of
      his father’s sail! Yes, yes! no more! it is done! we head for
      Nantucket! Come, my Captain, study out the course, and let us away!
      See, see! the boy’s face from the window! the boy’s hand on the hill!”
      
      But Ahab’s glance was averted; like a blighted fruit tree he shook, and
      cast his last, cindered apple to the soil.
      
      “What is it, what nameless, inscrutable, unearthly thing is it; what
      cozening, hidden lord and master, and cruel, remorseless emperor
      commands me; that against all natural lovings and longings, I so keep
      pushing, and crowding, and jamming myself on all the time; recklessly
      making me ready to do what in my own proper, natural heart, I durst not
      so much as dare? Is Ahab, Ahab? Is it I, God, or who, that lifts this
      arm? But if the great sun move not of himself; but is as an errand-boy
      in heaven; nor one single star can revolve, but by some invisible
      power; how then can this one small heart beat; this one small brain
      think thoughts; unless God does that beating, does that thinking, does
      that living, and not I. By heaven, man, we are turned round and round
      in this world, like yonder windlass, and Fate is the handspike. And all
      the time, lo! that smiling sky, and this unsounded sea! Look! see yon
      Albicore! who put it into him to chase and fang that flying-fish? Where
      do murderers go, man! Who’s to doom, when the judge himself is dragged
      to the bar? But it is a mild, mild wind, and a mild looking sky; and
      the air smells now, as if it blew from a far-away meadow; they have
      been making hay somewhere under the slopes of the Andes, Starbuck, and
      the mowers are sleeping among the new-mown hay. Sleeping? Aye, toil we
      how we may, we all sleep at last on the field. Sleep? Aye, and rust
      amid greenness; as last year’s scythes flung down, and left in the
      half-cut swaths—Starbuck!”
      
      But blanched to a corpse’s hue with despair, the Mate had stolen away.
      
      Ahab crossed the deck to gaze over on the other side; but started at
      two reflected, fixed eyes in the water there. Fedallah was motionlessly
      leaning over the same rail.
      
      
      CHAPTER 133. The Chase—First Day.
      
      That night, in the mid-watch, when the old man—as his wont at
      intervals—stepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned, and went
      to his pivot-hole, he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely, snuffing
      up the sea air as a sagacious ship’s dog will, in drawing nigh to some
      barbarous isle. He declared that a whale must be near. Soon that
      peculiar odor, sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living
      sperm whale, was palpable to all the watch; nor was any mariner
      surprised when, after inspecting the compass, and then the dog-vane,
      and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as
      possible, Ahab rapidly ordered the ship’s course to be slightly
      altered, and the sail to be shortened.
      
      The acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated
      at daybreak, by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and
      lengthwise ahead, smooth as oil, and resembling in the pleated watery
      wrinkles bordering it, the polished metallic-like marks of some swift
      tide-rip, at the mouth of a deep, rapid stream.
      
      “Man the mast-heads! Call all hands!”
      
      Thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle
      deck, Daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they
      seemed to exhale from the scuttle, so instantaneously did they appear
      with their clothes in their hands.
      
      “What d’ye see?” cried Ahab, flattening his face to the sky.
      
      “Nothing, nothing sir!” was the sound hailing down in reply.
      
      “T’gallant sails!—stunsails! alow and aloft, and on both sides!”
      
      All sail being set, he now cast loose the life-line, reserved for
      swaying him to the main royal-mast head; and in a few moments they were
      hoisting him thither, when, while but two thirds of the way aloft, and
      while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the
      main-top-sail and top-gallant-sail, he raised a gull-like cry in the
      air. “There she blows!—there she blows! A hump like a snow-hill! It is
      Moby Dick!”
      
      Fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three
      look-outs, the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous
      whale they had so long been pursuing. Ahab had now gained his final
      perch, some feet above the other look-outs, Tashtego standing just
      beneath him on the cap of the top-gallant-mast, so that the Indian’s
      head was almost on a level with Ahab’s heel. From this height the whale
      was now seen some mile or so ahead, at every roll of the sea revealing
      his high sparkling hump, and regularly jetting his silent spout into
      the air. To the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they
      had so long ago beheld in the moonlit Atlantic and Indian Oceans.
      
      “And did none of ye see it before?” cried Ahab, hailing the perched men
      all around him.
      
      “I saw him almost that same instant, sir, that Captain Ahab did, and I
      cried out,” said Tashtego.
      
      “Not the same instant; not the same—no, the doubloon is mine, Fate
      reserved the doubloon for me. _I_ only; none of ye could have raised
      the White Whale first. There she blows!—there she blows!—there she
      blows! There again!—there again!” he cried, in long-drawn, lingering,
      methodic tones, attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whale’s
      visible jets. “He’s going to sound! In stunsails! Down
      top-gallant-sails! Stand by three boats. Mr. Starbuck, remember, stay
      on board, and keep the ship. Helm there! Luff, luff a point! So;
      steady, man, steady! There go flukes! No, no; only black water! All
      ready the boats there? Stand by, stand by! Lower me, Mr. Starbuck;
      lower, lower,—quick, quicker!” and he slid through the air to the deck.
      
      “He is heading straight to leeward, sir,” cried Stubb, “right away from
      us; cannot have seen the ship yet.”
      
      “Be dumb, man! Stand by the braces! Hard down the helm!—brace up!
      Shiver her!—shiver her!—So; well that! Boats, boats!”
      
      Soon all the boats but Starbuck’s were dropped; all the boat-sails
      set—all the paddles plying; with rippling swiftness, shooting to
      leeward; and Ahab heading the onset. A pale, death-glimmer lit up
      Fedallah’s sunken eyes; a hideous motion gnawed his mouth.
      
      Like noiseless nautilus shells, their light prows sped through the sea;
      but only slowly they neared the foe. As they neared him, the ocean grew
      still more smooth; seemed drawing a carpet over its waves; seemed a
      noon-meadow, so serenely it spread. At length the breathless hunter
      came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey, that his entire dazzling
      hump was distinctly visible, sliding along the sea as if an isolated
      thing, and continually set in a revolving ring of finest, fleecy,
      greenish foam. He saw the vast, involved wrinkles of the slightly
      projecting head beyond. Before it, far out on the soft Turkish-rugged
      waters, went the glistening white shadow from his broad, milky
      forehead, a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade; and
      behind, the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving
      valley of his steady wake; and on either hand bright bubbles arose and
      danced by his side. But these were broken again by the light toes of
      hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea, alternate with their
      fitful flight; and like to some flag-staff rising from the painted hull
      of an argosy, the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected
      from the white whale’s back; and at intervals one of the cloud of
      soft-toed fowls hovering, and to and fro skimming like a canopy over
      the fish, silently perched and rocked on this pole, the long tail
      feathers streaming like pennons.
      
      A gentle joyousness—a mighty mildness of repose in swiftness, invested
      the gliding whale. Not the white bull Jupiter swimming away with
      ravished Europa clinging to his graceful horns; his lovely, leering
      eyes sideways intent upon the maid; with smooth bewitching fleetness,
      rippling straight for the nuptial bower in Crete; not Jove, not that
      great majesty Supreme! did surpass the glorified White Whale as he so
      divinely swam.
      
      On each soft side—coincident with the parted swell, that but once
      leaving him, then flowed so wide away—on each bright side, the whale
      shed off enticings. No wonder there had been some among the hunters who
      namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity, had ventured
      to assail it; but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of
      tornadoes. Yet calm, enticing calm, oh, whale! thou glidest on, to all
      who for the first time eye thee, no matter how many in that same way
      thou may’st have bejuggled and destroyed before.
      
      And thus, through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea, among
      waves whose hand-clappings were suspended by exceeding rapture, Moby
      Dick moved on, still withholding from sight the full terrors of his
      submerged trunk, entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw.
      But soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water; for an
      instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch, like Virginia’s
      Natural Bridge, and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air,
      the grand god revealed himself, sounded, and went out of sight.
      Hoveringly halting, and dipping on the wing, the white sea-fowls
      longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left.
      
      With oars apeak, and paddles down, the sheets of their sails adrift,
      the three boats now stilly floated, awaiting Moby Dick’s reappearance.
      
      “An hour,” said Ahab, standing rooted in his boat’s stern; and he gazed
      beyond the whale’s place, towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing
      vacancies to leeward. It was only an instant; for again his eyes seemed
      whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle. The breeze
      now freshened; the sea began to swell.
      
      “The birds!—the birds!” cried Tashtego.
      
      In long Indian file, as when herons take wing, the white birds were now
      all flying towards Ahab’s boat; and when within a few yards began
      fluttering over the water there, wheeling round and round, with joyous,
      expectant cries. Their vision was keener than man’s; Ahab could
      discover no sign in the sea. But suddenly as he peered down and down
      into its depths, he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a
      white weasel, with wonderful celerity uprising, and magnifying as it
      rose, till it turned, and then there were plainly revealed two long
      crooked rows of white, glistening teeth, floating up from the
      undiscoverable bottom. It was Moby Dick’s open mouth and scrolled jaw;
      his vast, shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea.
      The glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an open-doored marble
      tomb; and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar, Ahab whirled
      the craft aside from this tremendous apparition. Then, calling upon
      Fedallah to change places with him, went forward to the bows, and
      seizing Perth’s harpoon, commanded his crew to grasp their oars and
      stand by to stern.
      
      Now, by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis,
      its bow, by anticipation, was made to face the whale’s head while yet
      under water. But as if perceiving this stratagem, Moby Dick, with that
      malicious intelligence ascribed to him, sidelingly transplanted
      himself, as it were, in an instant, shooting his pleated head
      lengthwise beneath the boat.
      
      Through and through; through every plank and each rib, it thrilled for
      an instant, the whale obliquely lying on his back, in the manner of a
      biting shark, slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his
      mouth, so that the long, narrow, scrolled lower jaw curled high up into
      the open air, and one of the teeth caught in a row-lock. The bluish
      pearl-white of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of Ahab’s
      head, and reached higher than that. In this attitude the White Whale
      now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse. With
      unastonished eyes Fedallah gazed, and crossed his arms; but the
      tiger-yellow crew were tumbling over each other’s heads to gain the
      uttermost stern.
      
      And now, while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out, as the
      whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way; and from his
      body being submerged beneath the boat, he could not be darted at from
      the bows, for the bows were almost inside of him, as it were; and while
      the other boats involuntarily paused, as before a quick crisis
      impossible to withstand, then it was that monomaniac Ahab, furious with
      this tantalizing vicinity of his foe, which placed him all alive and
      helpless in the very jaws he hated; frenzied with all this, he seized
      the long bone with his naked hands, and wildly strove to wrench it from
      its gripe. As now he thus vainly strove, the jaw slipped from him; the
      frail gunwales bent in, collapsed, and snapped, as both jaws, like an
      enormous shears, sliding further aft, bit the craft completely in
      twain, and locked themselves fast again in the sea, midway between the
      two floating wrecks. These floated aside, the broken ends drooping, the
      crew at the stern-wreck clinging to the gunwales, and striving to hold
      fast to the oars to lash them across.
      
      At that preluding moment, ere the boat was yet snapped, Ahab, the first
      to perceive the whale’s intent, by the crafty upraising of his head, a
      movement that loosed his hold for the time; at that moment his hand had
      made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite. But only
      slipping further into the whale’s mouth, and tilting over sideways as
      it slipped, the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw; spilled him
      out of it, as he leaned to the push; and so he fell flat-faced upon the
      sea.
      
      Ripplingly withdrawing from his prey, Moby Dick now lay at a little
      distance, vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the
      billows; and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body;
      so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rose—some twenty or more feet
      out of the water—the now rising swells, with all their confluent waves,
      dazzlingly broke against it; vindictively tossing their shivered spray
      still higher into the air.* So, in a gale, the but half baffled Channel
      billows only recoil from the base of the Eddystone, triumphantly to
      overleap its summit with their scud.
      
      *This motion is peculiar to the sperm whale. It receives its
      designation (pitchpoling) from its being likened to that preliminary
      up-and-down poise of the whale-lance, in the exercise called
      pitchpoling, previously described. By this motion the whale must best
      and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him.
      
      But soon resuming his horizontal attitude, Moby Dick swam swiftly round
      and round the wrecked crew; sideways churning the water in his vengeful
      wake, as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly
      assault. The sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him, as the
      blood of grapes and mulberries cast before Antiochus’s elephants in the
      book of Maccabees. Meanwhile Ahab half smothered in the foam of the
      whale’s insolent tail, and too much of a cripple to swim,—though he
      could still keep afloat, even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that;
      helpless Ahab’s head was seen, like a tossed bubble which the least
      chance shock might burst. From the boat’s fragmentary stern, Fedallah
      incuriously and mildly eyed him; the clinging crew, at the other
      drifting end, could not succor him; more than enough was it for them to
      look to themselves. For so revolvingly appalling was the White Whale’s
      aspect, and so planetarily swift the ever-contracting circles he made,
      that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them. And though the other
      boats, unharmed, still hovered hard by; still they dared not pull into
      the eddy to strike, lest that should be the signal for the instant
      destruction of the jeopardized castaways, Ahab and all; nor in that
      case could they themselves hope to escape. With straining eyes, then,
      they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone, whose centre had
      now become the old man’s head.
      
      Meantime, from the beginning all this had been descried from the ship’s
      mast heads; and squaring her yards, she had borne down upon the scene;
      and was now so nigh, that Ahab in the water hailed her!—“Sail on
      the”—but that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from Moby Dick, and
      whelmed him for the time. But struggling out of it again, and chancing
      to rise on a towering crest, he shouted,—“Sail on the whale!—Drive him
      off!”
      
      The Pequod’s prows were pointed; and breaking up the charmed circle,
      she effectually parted the white whale from his victim. As he sullenly
      swam off, the boats flew to the rescue.
      
      Dragged into Stubb’s boat with blood-shot, blinded eyes, the white
      brine caking in his wrinkles; the long tension of Ahab’s bodily
      strength did crack, and helplessly he yielded to his body’s doom: for a
      time, lying all crushed in the bottom of Stubb’s boat, like one trodden
      under foot of herds of elephants. Far inland, nameless wails came from
      him, as desolate sounds from out ravines.
      
      But this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more
      abbreviate it. In an instant’s compass, great hearts sometimes condense
      to one deep pang, the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused
      through feebler men’s whole lives. And so, such hearts, though summary
      in each one suffering; still, if the gods decree it, in their life-time
      aggregate a whole age of woe, wholly made up of instantaneous
      intensities; for even in their pointless centres, those noble natures
      contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls.
      
      “The harpoon,” said Ahab, half way rising, and draggingly leaning on
      one bended arm—“is it safe?”
      
      “Aye, sir, for it was not darted; this is it,” said Stubb, showing it.
      
      “Lay it before me;—any missing men?”
      
      “One, two, three, four, five;—there were five oars, sir, and here are
      five men.”
      
      “That’s good.—Help me, man; I wish to stand. So, so, I see him! there!
      there! going to leeward still; what a leaping spout!—Hands off from me!
      The eternal sap runs up in Ahab’s bones again! Set the sail; out oars;
      the helm!”
      
      It is often the case that when a boat is stove, its crew, being picked
      up by another boat, help to work that second boat; and the chase is
      thus continued with what is called double-banked oars. It was thus now.
      But the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the
      whale, for he seemed to have treble-banked his every fin; swimming with
      a velocity which plainly showed, that if now, under these
      circumstances, pushed on, the chase would prove an indefinitely
      prolonged, if not a hopeless one; nor could any crew endure for so long
      a period, such an unintermitted, intense straining at the oar; a thing
      barely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude. The ship itself,
      then, as it sometimes happens, offered the most promising intermediate
      means of overtaking the chase. Accordingly, the boats now made for her,
      and were soon swayed up to their cranes—the two parts of the wrecked
      boat having been previously secured by her—and then hoisting everything
      to her side, and stacking her canvas high up, and sideways
      outstretching it with stun-sails, like the double-jointed wings of an
      albatross; the Pequod bore down in the leeward wake of Moby-Dick. At
      the well known, methodic intervals, the whale’s glittering spout was
      regularly announced from the manned mast-heads; and when he would be
      reported as just gone down, Ahab would take the time, and then pacing
      the deck, binnacle-watch in hand, so soon as the last second of the
      allotted hour expired, his voice was heard.—“Whose is the doubloon now?
      D’ye see him?” and if the reply was, No, sir! straightway he commanded
      them to lift him to his perch. In this way the day wore on; Ahab, now
      aloft and motionless; anon, unrestingly pacing the planks.
      
      As he was thus walking, uttering no sound, except to hail the men
      aloft, or to bid them hoist a sail still higher, or to spread one to a
      still greater breadth—thus to and fro pacing, beneath his slouched hat,
      at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat, which had been dropped
      upon the quarter-deck, and lay there reversed; broken bow to shattered
      stern. At last he paused before it; and as in an already over-clouded
      sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across, so over the old
      man’s face there now stole some such added gloom as this.
      
      Stubb saw him pause; and perhaps intending, not vainly, though, to
      evince his own unabated fortitude, and thus keep up a valiant place in
      his Captain’s mind, he advanced, and eyeing the wreck exclaimed—“The
      thistle the ass refused; it pricked his mouth too keenly, sir; ha! ha!”
      
      “What soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck? Man, man! did
      I not know thee brave as fearless fire (and as mechanical) I could
      swear thou wert a poltroon. Groan nor laugh should be heard before a
      wreck.”
      
      “Aye, sir,” said Starbuck drawing near, “’tis a solemn sight; an omen,
      and an ill one.”
      
      “Omen? omen?—the dictionary! If the gods think to speak outright to
      man, they will honorably speak outright; not shake their heads, and
      give an old wives’ darkling hint.—Begone! Ye two are the opposite poles
      of one thing; Starbuck is Stubb reversed, and Stubb is Starbuck; and ye
      two are all mankind; and Ahab stands alone among the millions of the
      peopled earth, nor gods nor men his neighbors! Cold, cold—I shiver!—How
      now? Aloft there! D’ye see him? Sing out for every spout, though he
      spout ten times a second!”
      
      The day was nearly done; only the hem of his golden robe was rustling.
      Soon, it was almost dark, but the look-out men still remained unset.
      
      “Can’t see the spout now, sir;—too dark”—cried a voice from the air.
      
      “How heading when last seen?”
      
      “As before, sir,—straight to leeward.”
      
      “Good! he will travel slower now ’tis night. Down royals and
      top-gallant stun-sails, Mr. Starbuck. We must not run over him before
      morning; he’s making a passage now, and may heave-to a while. Helm
      there! keep her full before the wind!—Aloft! come down!—Mr. Stubb, send
      a fresh hand to the fore-mast head, and see it manned till
      morning.”—Then advancing towards the doubloon in the main-mast—“Men,
      this gold is mine, for I earned it; but I shall let it abide here till
      the White Whale is dead; and then, whosoever of ye first raises him,
      upon the day he shall be killed, this gold is that man’s; and if on
      that day I shall again raise him, then, ten times its sum shall be
      divided among all of ye! Away now!—the deck is thine, sir!”
      
      And so saying, he placed himself half way within the scuttle, and
      slouching his hat, stood there till dawn, except when at intervals
      rousing himself to see how the night wore on.
      
      
      CHAPTER 134. The Chase—Second Day.
      
      At day-break, the three mast-heads were punctually manned afresh.
      
      “D’ye see him?” cried Ahab after allowing a little space for the light
      to spread.
      
      “See nothing, sir.”
      
      “Turn up all hands and make sail! he travels faster than I thought
      for;—the top-gallant sails!—aye, they should have been kept on her all
      night. But no matter—’tis but resting for the rush.”
      
      Here be it said, that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular
      whale, continued through day into night, and through night into day, is
      a thing by no means unprecedented in the South sea fishery. For such is
      the wonderful skill, prescience of experience, and invincible
      confidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the Nantucket
      commanders; that from the simple observation of a whale when last
      descried, they will, under certain given circumstances, pretty
      accurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue to
      swim for a time, while out of sight, as well as his probable rate of
      progression during that period. And, in these cases, somewhat as a
      pilot, when about losing sight of a coast, whose general trending he
      well knows, and which he desires shortly to return to again, but at
      some further point; like as this pilot stands by his compass, and takes
      the precise bearing of the cape at present visible, in order the more
      certainly to hit aright the remote, unseen headland, eventually to be
      visited: so does the fisherman, at his compass, with the whale; for
      after being chased, and diligently marked, through several hours of
      daylight, then, when night obscures the fish, the creature’s future
      wake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious
      mind of the hunter, as the pilot’s coast is to him. So that to this
      hunter’s wondrous skill, the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in
      water, a wake, is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the
      steadfast land. And as the mighty iron Leviathan of the modern railway
      is so familiarly known in its every pace, that, with watches in their
      hands, men time his rate as doctors that of a baby’s pulse; and lightly
      say of it, the up train or the down train will reach such or such a
      spot, at such or such an hour; even so, almost, there are occasions
      when these Nantucketers time that other Leviathan of the deep,
      according to the observed humor of his speed; and say to themselves, so
      many hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles, will have
      about reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude. But to
      render this acuteness at all successful in the end, the wind and the
      sea must be the whaleman’s allies; for of what present avail to the
      becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is
      exactly ninety-three leagues and a quarter from his port? Inferable
      from these statements, are many collateral subtile matters touching the
      chase of whales.
      
      The ship tore on; leaving such a furrow in the sea as when a
      cannon-ball, missent, becomes a plough-share and turns up the level
      field.
      
      “By salt and hemp!” cried Stubb, “but this swift motion of the deck
      creeps up one’s legs and tingles at the heart. This ship and I are two
      brave fellows!—Ha, ha! Some one take me up, and launch me, spine-wise,
      on the sea,—for by live-oaks! my spine’s a keel. Ha, ha! we go the gait
      that leaves no dust behind!”
      
      “There she blows—she blows!—she blows!—right ahead!” was now the
      mast-head cry.
      
      “Aye, aye!” cried Stubb, “I knew it—ye can’t escape—blow on and split
      your spout, O whale! the mad fiend himself is after ye! blow your
      trump—blister your lungs!—Ahab will dam off your blood, as a miller
      shuts his watergate upon the stream!”
      
      And Stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew. The frenzies
      of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up, like old wine
      worked anew. Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might
      have felt before; these were not only now kept out of sight through the
      growing awe of Ahab, but they were broken up, and on all sides routed,
      as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison. The hand
      of Fate had snatched all their souls; and by the stirring perils of the
      previous day; the rack of the past night’s suspense; the fixed,
      unfearing, blind, reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging
      towards its flying mark; by all these things, their hearts were bowled
      along. The wind that made great bellies of their sails, and rushed the
      vessel on by arms invisible as irresistible; this seemed the symbol of
      that unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race.
      
      They were one man, not thirty. For as the one ship that held them all;
      though it was put together of all contrasting things—oak, and maple,
      and pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp—yet all these ran into each
      other in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both balanced
      and directed by the long central keel; even so, all the individualities
      of the crew, this man’s valor, that man’s fear; guilt and guiltiness,
      all varieties were welded into oneness, and were all directed to that
      fatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to.
      
      The rigging lived. The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were
      outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs. Clinging to a spar with one
      hand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings; others,
      shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking
      yards; all the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready and ripe for
      their fate. Ah! how they still strove through that infinite blueness to
      seek out the thing that might destroy them!
      
      “Why sing ye not out for him, if ye see him?” cried Ahab, when, after
      the lapse of some minutes since the first cry, no more had been heard.
      “Sway me up, men; ye have been deceived; not Moby Dick casts one odd
      jet that way, and then disappears.”
      
      It was even so; in their headlong eagerness, the men had mistaken some
      other thing for the whale-spout, as the event itself soon proved; for
      hardly had Ahab reached his perch; hardly was the rope belayed to its
      pin on deck, when he struck the key-note to an orchestra, that made the
      air vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles. The triumphant
      halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard, as—much nearer to the ship
      than the place of the imaginary jet, less than a mile ahead—Moby Dick
      bodily burst into view! For not by any calm and indolent spoutings; not
      by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head, did the
      White Whale now reveal his vicinity; but by the far more wondrous
      phenomenon of breaching. Rising with his utmost velocity from the
      furthest depths, the Sperm Whale thus booms his entire bulk into the
      pure element of air, and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam, shows
      his place to the distance of seven miles and more. In those moments,
      the torn, enraged waves he shakes off, seem his mane; in some cases,
      this breaching is his act of defiance.
      
      “There she breaches! there she breaches!” was the cry, as in his
      immeasurable bravadoes the White Whale tossed himself salmon-like to
      Heaven. So suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea, and relieved
      against the still bluer margin of the sky, the spray that he raised,
      for the moment, intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier; and
      stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling
      intensity, to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale.
      
      “Aye, breach your last to the sun, Moby Dick!” cried Ahab, “thy hour
      and thy harpoon are at hand!—Down! down all of ye, but one man at the
      fore. The boats!—stand by!”
      
      Unmindful of the tedious rope-ladders of the shrouds, the men, like
      shooting stars, slid to the deck, by the isolated backstays and
      halyards; while Ahab, less dartingly, but still rapidly was dropped
      from his perch.
      
      “Lower away,” he cried, so soon as he had reached his boat—a spare one,
      rigged the afternoon previous. “Mr. Starbuck, the ship is thine—keep
      away from the boats, but keep near them. Lower, all!”
      
      As if to strike a quick terror into them, by this time being the first
      assailant himself, Moby Dick had turned, and was now coming for the
      three crews. Ahab’s boat was central; and cheering his men, he told
      them he would take the whale head-and-head,—that is, pull straight up
      to his forehead,—a not uncommon thing; for when within a certain limit,
      such a course excludes the coming onset from the whale’s sidelong
      vision. But ere that close limit was gained, and while yet all three
      boats were plain as the ship’s three masts to his eye; the White Whale
      churning himself into furious speed, almost in an instant as it were,
      rushing among the boats with open jaws, and a lashing tail, offered
      appalling battle on every side; and heedless of the irons darted at him
      from every boat, seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank
      of which those boats were made. But skilfully manœuvred, incessantly
      wheeling like trained chargers in the field; the boats for a while
      eluded him; though, at times, but by a plank’s breadth; while all the
      time, Ahab’s unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds.
      
      But at last in his untraceable evolutions, the White Whale so crossed
      and recrossed, and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three
      lines now fast to him, that they foreshortened, and, of themselves,
      warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him; though now
      for a moment the whale drew aside a little, as if to rally for a more
      tremendous charge. Seizing that opportunity, Ahab first paid out more
      line: and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it again—hoping
      that way to disencumber it of some snarls—when lo!—a sight more savage
      than the embattled teeth of sharks!
      
      Caught and twisted—corkscrewed in the mazes of the line, loose harpoons
      and lances, with all their bristling barbs and points, came flashing
      and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of Ahab’s boat. Only one
      thing could be done. Seizing the boat-knife, he critically reached
      within—through—and then, without—the rays of steel; dragged in the line
      beyond, passed it, inboard, to the bowsman, and then, twice sundering
      the rope near the chocks—dropped the intercepted fagot of steel into
      the sea; and was all fast again. That instant, the White Whale made a
      sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines; by so
      doing, irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of Stubb and Flask
      towards his flukes; dashed them together like two rolling husks on a
      surf-beaten beach, and then, diving down into the sea, disappeared in a
      boiling maelstrom, in which, for a space, the odorous cedar chips of
      the wrecks danced round and round, like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly
      stirred bowl of punch.
      
      While the two crews were yet circling in the waters, reaching out after
      the revolving line-tubs, oars, and other floating furniture, while
      aslope little Flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial, twitching
      his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks; and Stubb was
      lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up; and while the old
      man’s line—now parting—admitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to
      rescue whom he could;—in that wild simultaneousness of a thousand
      concreted perils,—Ahab’s yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards
      Heaven by invisible wires,—as, arrow-like, shooting perpendicularly
      from the sea, the White Whale dashed his broad forehead against its
      bottom, and sent it, turning over and over, into the air; till it fell
      again—gunwale downwards—and Ahab and his men struggled out from under
      it, like seals from a sea-side cave.
      
      The first uprising momentum of the whale—modifying its direction as he
      struck the surface—involuntarily launched him along it, to a little
      distance from the centre of the destruction he had made; and with his
      back to it, he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from
      side to side; and whenever a stray oar, bit of plank, the least chip or
      crumb of the boats touched his skin, his tail swiftly drew back, and
      came sideways smiting the sea. But soon, as if satisfied that his work
      for that time was done, he pushed his pleated forehead through the
      ocean, and trailing after him the intertangled lines, continued his
      leeward way at a traveller’s methodic pace.
      
      As before, the attentive ship having descried the whole fight, again
      came bearing down to the rescue, and dropping a boat, picked up the
      floating mariners, tubs, oars, and whatever else could be caught at,
      and safely landed them on her decks. Some sprained shoulders, wrists,
      and ankles; livid contusions; wrenched harpoons and lances;
      inextricable intricacies of rope; shattered oars and planks; all these
      were there; but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen
      any one. As with Fedallah the day before, so Ahab was now found grimly
      clinging to his boat’s broken half, which afforded a comparatively easy
      float; nor did it so exhaust him as the previous day’s mishap.
      
      But when he was helped to the deck, all eyes were fastened upon him; as
      instead of standing by himself he still half-hung upon the shoulder of
      Starbuck, who had thus far been the foremost to assist him. His ivory
      leg had been snapped off, leaving but one short sharp splinter.
      
      “Aye, aye, Starbuck, ’tis sweet to lean sometimes, be the leaner who he
      will; and would old Ahab had leaned oftener than he has.”
      
      “The ferrule has not stood, sir,” said the carpenter, now coming up; “I
      put good work into that leg.”
      
      “But no bones broken, sir, I hope,” said Stubb with true concern.
      
      “Aye! and all splintered to pieces, Stubb!—d’ye see it.—But even with a
      broken bone, old Ahab is untouched; and I account no living bone of
      mine one jot more me, than this dead one that’s lost. Nor white whale,
      nor man, nor fiend, can so much as graze old Ahab in his own proper and
      inaccessible being. Can any lead touch yonder floor, any mast scrape
      yonder roof?—Aloft there! which way?”
      
      “Dead to leeward, sir.”
      
      “Up helm, then; pile on the sail again, ship keepers! down the rest of
      the spare boats and rig them—Mr. Starbuck away, and muster the boat’s
      crews.”
      
      “Let me first help thee towards the bulwarks, sir.”
      
      “Oh, oh, oh! how this splinter gores me now! Accursed fate! that the
      unconquerable captain in the soul should have such a craven mate!”
      
      “Sir?”
      
      “My body, man, not thee. Give me something for a cane—there, that
      shivered lance will do. Muster the men. Surely I have not seen him yet.
      By heaven it cannot be!—missing?—quick! call them all.”
      
      The old man’s hinted thought was true. Upon mustering the company, the
      Parsee was not there.
      
      “The Parsee!” cried Stubb—“he must have been caught in——”
      
      “The black vomit wrench thee!—run all of ye above, alow, cabin,
      forecastle—find him—not gone—not gone!”
      
      But quickly they returned to him with the tidings that the Parsee was
      nowhere to be found.
      
      “Aye, sir,” said Stubb—“caught among the tangles of your line—I thought
      I saw him dragging under.”
      
      “_My_ line! _my_ line? Gone?—gone? What means that little word?—What
      death-knell rings in it, that old Ahab shakes as if he were the belfry.
      The harpoon, too!—toss over the litter there,—d’ye see it?—the forged
      iron, men, the white whale’s—no, no, no,—blistered fool! this hand did
      dart it!—’tis in the fish!—Aloft there! Keep him nailed—Quick!—all
      hands to the rigging of the boats—collect the oars—harpooneers! the
      irons, the irons!—hoist the royals higher—a pull on all the
      sheets!—helm there! steady, steady for your life! I’ll ten times girdle
      the unmeasured globe; yea and dive straight through it, but I’ll slay
      him yet!”
      
      “Great God! but for one single instant show thyself,” cried Starbuck;
      “never, never wilt thou capture him, old man—In Jesus’ name no more of
      this, that’s worse than devil’s madness. Two days chased; twice stove
      to splinters; thy very leg once more snatched from under thee; thy evil
      shadow gone—all good angels mobbing thee with warnings:—what more
      wouldst thou have?—Shall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he
      swamps the last man? Shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the
      sea? Shall we be towed by him to the infernal world? Oh, oh,—Impiety
      and blasphemy to hunt him more!”
      
      “Starbuck, of late I’ve felt strangely moved to thee; ever since that
      hour we both saw—thou know’st what, in one another’s eyes. But in this
      matter of the whale, be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this
      hand—a lipless, unfeatured blank. Ahab is for ever Ahab, man. This
      whole act’s immutably decreed. ’Twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion
      years before this ocean rolled. Fool! I am the Fates’ lieutenant; I act
      under orders. Look thou, underling! that thou obeyest mine.—Stand round
      me, men. Ye see an old man cut down to the stump; leaning on a shivered
      lance; propped up on a lonely foot. ’Tis Ahab—his body’s part; but
      Ahab’s soul’s a centipede, that moves upon a hundred legs. I feel
      strained, half stranded, as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a
      gale; and I may look so. But ere I break, ye’ll hear me crack; and till
      ye hear _that_, know that Ahab’s hawser tows his purpose yet. Believe
      ye, men, in the things called omens? Then laugh aloud, and cry encore!
      For ere they drown, drowning things will twice rise to the surface;
      then rise again, to sink for evermore. So with Moby Dick—two days he’s
      floated—tomorrow will be the third. Aye, men, he’ll rise once more,—but
      only to spout his last! D’ye feel brave men, brave?”
      
      “As fearless fire,” cried Stubb.
      
      “And as mechanical,” muttered Ahab. Then as the men went forward, he
      muttered on: “The things called omens! And yesterday I talked the same
      to Starbuck there, concerning my broken boat. Oh! how valiantly I seek
      to drive out of others’ hearts what’s clinched so fast in mine!—The
      Parsee—the Parsee!—gone, gone? and he was to go before:—but still was
      to be seen again ere I could perish—How’s that?—There’s a riddle now
      might baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the whole line of
      judges:—like a hawk’s beak it pecks my brain. _I’ll_, _I’ll_ solve it,
      though!”
      
      When dusk descended, the whale was still in sight to leeward.
      
      So once more the sail was shortened, and everything passed nearly as on
      the previous night; only, the sound of hammers, and the hum of the
      grindstone was heard till nearly daylight, as the men toiled by
      lanterns in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and
      sharpening their fresh weapons for the morrow. Meantime, of the broken
      keel of Ahab’s wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg; while
      still as on the night before, slouched Ahab stood fixed within his
      scuttle; his hid, heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its
      dial; sat due eastward for the earliest sun.
      
      
      CHAPTER 135. The Chase.—Third Day.
      
      The morning of the third day dawned fair and fresh, and once more the
      solitary night-man at the fore-mast-head was relieved by crowds of the
      daylight look-outs, who dotted every mast and almost every spar.
      
      “D’ye see him?” cried Ahab; but the whale was not yet in sight.
      
      “In his infallible wake, though; but follow that wake, that’s all. Helm
      there; steady, as thou goest, and hast been going. What a lovely day
      again! were it a new-made world, and made for a summer-house to the
      angels, and this morning the first of its throwing open to them, a
      fairer day could not dawn upon that world. Here’s food for thought, had
      Ahab time to think; but Ahab never thinks; he only feels, feels, feels;
      _that’s_ tingling enough for mortal man! to think’s audacity. God only
      has that right and privilege. Thinking is, or ought to be, a coolness
      and a calmness; and our poor hearts throb, and our poor brains beat too
      much for that. And yet, I’ve sometimes thought my brain was very
      calm—frozen calm, this old skull cracks so, like a glass in which the
      contents turned to ice, and shiver it. And still this hair is growing
      now; this moment growing, and heat must breed it; but no, it’s like
      that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere, between the earthy
      clefts of Greenland ice or in Vesuvius lava. How the wild winds blow
      it; they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the
      tossed ship they cling to. A vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this
      through prison corridors and cells, and wards of hospitals, and
      ventilated them, and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces.
      Out upon it!—it’s tainted. Were I the wind, I’d blow no more on such a
      wicked, miserable world. I’d crawl somewhere to a cave, and slink
      there. And yet, ’tis a noble and heroic thing, the wind! who ever
      conquered it? In every fight it has the last and bitterest blow. Run
      tilting at it, and you but run through it. Ha! a coward wind that
      strikes stark naked men, but will not stand to receive a single blow.
      Even Ahab is a braver thing—a nobler thing than _that_. Would now the
      wind but had a body; but all the things that most exasperate and
      outrage mortal man, all these things are bodiless, but only bodiless as
      objects, not as agents. There’s a most special, a most cunning, oh, a
      most malicious difference! And yet, I say again, and swear it now, that
      there’s something all glorious and gracious in the wind. These warm
      Trade Winds, at least, that in the clear heavens blow straight on, in
      strong and steadfast, vigorous mildness; and veer not from their mark,
      however the baser currents of the sea may turn and tack, and mightiest
      Mississippies of the land swift and swerve about, uncertain where to go
      at last. And by the eternal Poles! these same Trades that so directly
      blow my good ship on; these Trades, or something like them—something so
      unchangeable, and full as strong, blow my keeled soul along! To it!
      Aloft there! What d’ye see?”
      
      “Nothing, sir.”
      
      “Nothing! and noon at hand! The doubloon goes a-begging! See the sun!
      Aye, aye, it must be so. I’ve oversailed him. How, got the start? Aye,
      he’s chasing _me_ now; not I, _him_—that’s bad; I might have known it,
      too. Fool! the lines—the harpoons he’s towing. Aye, aye, I have run him
      by last night. About! about! Come down, all of ye, but the regular look
      outs! Man the braces!”
      
      Steering as she had done, the wind had been somewhat on the Pequod’s
      quarter, so that now being pointed in the reverse direction, the braced
      ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own
      white wake.
      
      “Against the wind he now steers for the open jaw,” murmured Starbuck to
      himself, as he coiled the new-hauled main-brace upon the rail. “God
      keep us, but already my bones feel damp within me, and from the inside
      wet my flesh. I misdoubt me that I disobey my God in obeying him!”
      
      “Stand by to sway me up!” cried Ahab, advancing to the hempen basket.
      “We should meet him soon.”
      
      “Aye, aye, sir,” and straightway Starbuck did Ahab’s bidding, and once
      more Ahab swung on high.
      
      A whole hour now passed; gold-beaten out to ages. Time itself now held
      long breaths with keen suspense. But at last, some three points off the
      weather bow, Ahab descried the spout again, and instantly from the
      three mast-heads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had
      voiced it.
      
      “Forehead to forehead I meet thee, this third time, Moby Dick! On deck
      there!—brace sharper up; crowd her into the wind’s eye. He’s too far
      off to lower yet, Mr. Starbuck. The sails shake! Stand over that
      helmsman with a top-maul! So, so; he travels fast, and I must down. But
      let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea; there’s
      time for that. An old, old sight, and yet somehow so young; aye, and
      not changed a wink since I first saw it, a boy, from the sand-hills of
      Nantucket! The same!—the same!—the same to Noah as to me. There’s a
      soft shower to leeward. Such lovely leewardings! They must lead
      somewhere—to something else than common land, more palmy than the
      palms. Leeward! the white whale goes that way; look to windward, then;
      the better if the bitterer quarter. But good bye, good bye, old
      mast-head! What’s this?—green? aye, tiny mosses in these warped cracks.
      No such green weather stains on Ahab’s head! There’s the difference now
      between man’s old age and matter’s. But aye, old mast, we both grow old
      together; sound in our hulls, though, are we not, my ship? Aye, minus a
      leg, that’s all. By heaven this dead wood has the better of my live
      flesh every way. I can’t compare with it; and I’ve known some ships
      made of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the most vital
      stuff of vital fathers. What’s that he said? he should still go before
      me, my pilot; and yet to be seen again? But where? Will I have eyes at
      the bottom of the sea, supposing I descend those endless stairs? and
      all night I’ve been sailing from him, wherever he did sink to. Aye,
      aye, like many more thou told’st direful truth as touching thyself, O
      Parsee; but, Ahab, there thy shot fell short. Good-bye, mast-head—keep
      a good eye upon the whale, the while I’m gone. We’ll talk to-morrow,
      nay, to-night, when the white whale lies down there, tied by head and
      tail.”
      
      He gave the word; and still gazing round him, was steadily lowered
      through the cloven blue air to the deck.
      
      In due time the boats were lowered; but as standing in his shallop’s
      stern, Ahab just hovered upon the point of the descent, he waved to the
      mate,—who held one of the tackle-ropes on deck—and bade him pause.
      
      “Starbuck!”
      
      “Sir?”
      
      “For the third time my soul’s ship starts upon this voyage, Starbuck.”
      
      “Aye, sir, thou wilt have it so.”
      
      “Some ships sail from their ports, and ever afterwards are missing,
      Starbuck!”
      
      “Truth, sir: saddest truth.”
      
      “Some men die at ebb tide; some at low water; some at the full of the
      flood;—and I feel now like a billow that’s all one crested comb,
      Starbuck. I am old;—shake hands with me, man.”
      
      Their hands met; their eyes fastened; Starbuck’s tears the glue.
      
      “Oh, my captain, my captain!—noble heart—go not—go not!—see, it’s a
      brave man that weeps; how great the agony of the persuasion then!”
      
      “Lower away!”—cried Ahab, tossing the mate’s arm from him. “Stand by
      the crew!”
      
      In an instant the boat was pulling round close under the stern.
      
      “The sharks! the sharks!” cried a voice from the low cabin-window
      there; “O master, my master, come back!”
      
      But Ahab heard nothing; for his own voice was high-lifted then; and the
      boat leaped on.
      
      Yet the voice spake true; for scarce had he pushed from the ship, when
      numbers of sharks, seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath
      the hull, maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars, every time
      they dipped in the water; and in this way accompanied the boat with
      their bites. It is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whale-boats
      in those swarming seas; the sharks at times apparently following them
      in the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of
      marching regiments in the east. But these were the first sharks that
      had been observed by the Pequod since the White Whale had been first
      descried; and whether it was that Ahab’s crew were all such
      tiger-yellow barbarians, and therefore their flesh more musky to the
      senses of the sharks—a matter sometimes well known to affect
      them,—however it was, they seemed to follow that one boat without
      molesting the others.
      
      “Heart of wrought steel!” murmured Starbuck gazing over the side, and
      following with his eyes the receding boat—“canst thou yet ring boldly
      to that sight?—lowering thy keel among ravening sharks, and followed by
      them, open-mouthed to the chase; and this the critical third day?—For
      when three days flow together in one continuous intense pursuit; be
      sure the first is the morning, the second the noon, and the third the
      evening and the end of that thing—be that end what it may. Oh! my God!
      what is this that shoots through me, and leaves me so deadly calm, yet
      expectant,—fixed at the top of a shudder! Future things swim before me,
      as in empty outlines and skeletons; all the past is somehow grown dim.
      Mary, girl! thou fadest in pale glories behind me; boy! I seem to see
      but thy eyes grown wondrous blue. Strangest problems of life seem
      clearing; but clouds sweep between—Is my journey’s end coming? My legs
      feel faint; like his who has footed it all day. Feel thy heart,—beats
      it yet? Stir thyself, Starbuck!—stave it off—move, move! speak
      aloud!—Mast-head there! See ye my boy’s hand on the hill?—Crazed;—aloft
      there!—keep thy keenest eye upon the boats:—mark well the whale!—Ho!
      again!—drive off that hawk! see! he pecks—he tears the vane”—pointing
      to the red flag flying at the main-truck—“Ha! he soars away with
      it!—Where’s the old man now? see’st thou that sight, oh Ahab!—shudder,
      shudder!”
      
      The boats had not gone very far, when by a signal from the mast-heads—a
      downward pointed arm, Ahab knew that the whale had sounded; but
      intending to be near him at the next rising, he held on his way a
      little sideways from the vessel; the becharmed crew maintaining the
      profoundest silence, as the head-beat waves hammered and hammered
      against the opposing bow.
      
      “Drive, drive in your nails, oh ye waves! to their uttermost heads
      drive them in! ye but strike a thing without a lid; and no coffin and
      no hearse can be mine:—and hemp only can kill me! Ha! ha!”
      
      Suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles; then
      quickly upheaved, as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice,
      swiftly rising to the surface. A low rumbling sound was heard; a
      subterraneous hum; and then all held their breaths; as bedraggled with
      trailing ropes, and harpoons, and lances, a vast form shot lengthwise,
      but obliquely from the sea. Shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist,
      it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air; and then fell swamping
      back into the deep. Crushed thirty feet upwards, the waters flashed for
      an instant like heaps of fountains, then brokenly sank in a shower of
      flakes, leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the
      marble trunk of the whale.
      
      “Give way!” cried Ahab to the oarsmen, and the boats darted forward to
      the attack; but maddened by yesterday’s fresh irons that corroded in
      him, Moby Dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell
      from heaven. The wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad
      white forehead, beneath the transparent skin, looked knitted together;
      as head on, he came churning his tail among the boats; and once more
      flailed them apart; spilling out the irons and lances from the two
      mates’ boats, and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows,
      but leaving Ahab’s almost without a scar.
      
      While Daggoo and Queequeg were stopping the strained planks; and as the
      whale swimming out from them, turned, and showed one entire flank as he
      shot by them again; at that moment a quick cry went up. Lashed round
      and round to the fish’s back; pinioned in the turns upon turns in
      which, during the past night, the whale had reeled the involutions of
      the lines around him, the half torn body of the Parsee was seen; his
      sable raiment frayed to shreds; his distended eyes turned full upon old
      Ahab.
      
      The harpoon dropped from his hand.
      
      “Befooled, befooled!”—drawing in a long lean breath—“Aye, Parsee! I see
      thee again.—Aye, and thou goest before; and this, _this_ then is the
      hearse that thou didst promise. But I hold thee to the last letter of
      thy word. Where is the second hearse? Away, mates, to the ship! those
      boats are useless now; repair them if ye can in time, and return to me;
      if not, Ahab is enough to die—Down, men! the first thing that but
      offers to jump from this boat I stand in, that thing I harpoon. Ye are
      not other men, but my arms and my legs; and so obey me.—Where’s the
      whale? gone down again?”
      
      But he looked too nigh the boat; for as if bent upon escaping with the
      corpse he bore, and as if the particular place of the last encounter
      had been but a stage in his leeward voyage, Moby Dick was now again
      steadily swimming forward; and had almost passed the ship,—which thus
      far had been sailing in the contrary direction to him, though for the
      present her headway had been stopped. He seemed swimming with his
      utmost velocity, and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight
      path in the sea.
      
      “Oh! Ahab,” cried Starbuck, “not too late is it, even now, the third
      day, to desist. See! Moby Dick seeks thee not. It is thou, thou, that
      madly seekest him!”
      
      Setting sail to the rising wind, the lonely boat was swiftly impelled
      to leeward, by both oars and canvas. And at last when Ahab was sliding
      by the vessel, so near as plainly to distinguish Starbuck’s face as he
      leaned over the rail, he hailed him to turn the vessel about, and
      follow him, not too swiftly, at a judicious interval. Glancing upwards,
      he saw Tashtego, Queequeg, and Daggoo, eagerly mounting to the three
      mast-heads; while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats
      which had but just been hoisted to the side, and were busily at work in
      repairing them. One after the other, through the port-holes, as he
      sped, he also caught flying glimpses of Stubb and Flask, busying
      themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances. As he saw all
      this; as he heard the hammers in the broken boats; far other hammers
      seemed driving a nail into his heart. But he rallied. And now marking
      that the vane or flag was gone from the main-mast-head, he shouted to
      Tashtego, who had just gained that perch, to descend again for another
      flag, and a hammer and nails, and so nail it to the mast.
      
      Whether fagged by the three days’ running chase, and the resistance to
      his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore; or whether it was some
      latent deceitfulness and malice in him: whichever was true, the White
      Whale’s way now began to abate, as it seemed, from the boat so rapidly
      nearing him once more; though indeed the whale’s last start had not
      been so long a one as before. And still as Ahab glided over the waves
      the unpitying sharks accompanied him; and so pertinaciously stuck to
      the boat; and so continually bit at the plying oars, that the blades
      became jagged and crunched, and left small splinters in the sea, at
      almost every dip.
      
      “Heed them not! those teeth but give new rowlocks to your oars. Pull
      on! ’tis the better rest, the shark’s jaw than the yielding water.”
      
      “But at every bite, sir, the thin blades grow smaller and smaller!”
      
      “They will last long enough! pull on!—But who can tell”—he
      muttered—“whether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on
      Ahab?—But pull on! Aye, all alive, now—we near him. The helm! take the
      helm! let me pass,”—and so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward
      to the bows of the still flying boat.
      
      At length as the craft was cast to one side, and ran ranging along with
      the White Whale’s flank, he seemed strangely oblivious of its
      advance—as the whale sometimes will—and Ahab was fairly within the
      smoky mountain mist, which, thrown off from the whale’s spout, curled
      round his great, Monadnock hump; he was even thus close to him; when,
      with body arched back, and both arms lengthwise high-lifted to the
      poise, he darted his fierce iron, and his far fiercer curse into the
      hated whale. As both steel and curse sank to the socket, as if sucked
      into a morass, Moby Dick sideways writhed; spasmodically rolled his
      nigh flank against the bow, and, without staving a hole in it, so
      suddenly canted the boat over, that had it not been for the elevated
      part of the gunwale to which he then clung, Ahab would once more have
      been tossed into the sea. As it was, three of the oarsmen—who foreknew
      not the precise instant of the dart, and were therefore unprepared for
      its effects—these were flung out; but so fell, that, in an instant two
      of them clutched the gunwale again, and rising to its level on a
      combing wave, hurled themselves bodily inboard again; the third man
      helplessly dropping astern, but still afloat and swimming.
      
      Almost simultaneously, with a mighty volition of ungraduated,
      instantaneous swiftness, the White Whale darted through the weltering
      sea. But when Ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with
      the line, and hold it so; and commanded the crew to turn round on their
      seats, and tow the boat up to the mark; the moment the treacherous line
      felt that double strain and tug, it snapped in the empty air!
      
      “What breaks in me? Some sinew cracks!—’tis whole again; oars! oars!
      Burst in upon him!”
      
      Hearing the tremendous rush of the sea-crashing boat, the whale wheeled
      round to present his blank forehead at bay; but in that evolution,
      catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship; seemingly seeing
      in it the source of all his persecutions; bethinking it—it may be—a
      larger and nobler foe; of a sudden, he bore down upon its advancing
      prow, smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam.
      
      Ahab staggered; his hand smote his forehead. “I grow blind; hands!
      stretch out before me that I may yet grope my way. Is’t night?”
      
      “The whale! The ship!” cried the cringing oarsmen.
      
      “Oars! oars! Slope downwards to thy depths, O sea, that ere it be for
      ever too late, Ahab may slide this last, last time upon his mark! I
      see: the ship! the ship! Dash on, my men! Will ye not save my ship?”
      
      But as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the
      sledge-hammering seas, the before whale-smitten bow-ends of two planks
      burst through, and in an instant almost, the temporarily disabled boat
      lay nearly level with the waves; its half-wading, splashing crew,
      trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water.
      
      Meantime, for that one beholding instant, Tashtego’s mast-head hammer
      remained suspended in his hand; and the red flag, half-wrapping him as
      with a plaid, then streamed itself straight out from him, as his own
      forward-flowing heart; while Starbuck and Stubb, standing upon the
      bowsprit beneath, caught sight of the down-coming monster just as soon
      as he.
      
      “The whale, the whale! Up helm, up helm! Oh, all ye sweet powers of
      air, now hug me close! Let not Starbuck die, if die he must, in a
      woman’s fainting fit. Up helm, I say—ye fools, the jaw! the jaw! Is
      this the end of all my bursting prayers? all my life-long fidelities?
      Oh, Ahab, Ahab, lo, thy work. Steady! helmsman, steady. Nay, nay! Up
      helm again! He turns to meet us! Oh, his unappeasable brow drives on
      towards one, whose duty tells him he cannot depart. My God, stand by me
      now!”
      
      “Stand not by me, but stand under me, whoever you are that will now
      help Stubb; for Stubb, too, sticks here. I grin at thee, thou grinning
      whale! Who ever helped Stubb, or kept Stubb awake, but Stubb’s own
      unwinking eye? And now poor Stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is
      all too soft; would it were stuffed with brushwood! I grin at thee,
      thou grinning whale! Look ye, sun, moon, and stars! I call ye assassins
      of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost. For all that, I would
      yet ring glasses with ye, would ye but hand the cup! Oh, oh! oh, oh!
      thou grinning whale, but there’ll be plenty of gulping soon! Why fly ye
      not, O Ahab! For me, off shoes and jacket to it; let Stubb die in his
      drawers! A most mouldy and over salted death, though;—cherries!
      cherries! cherries! Oh, Flask, for one red cherry ere we die!”
      
      “Cherries? I only wish that we were where they grow. Oh, Stubb, I hope
      my poor mother’s drawn my part-pay ere this; if not, few coppers will
      now come to her, for the voyage is up.”
      
      From the ship’s bows, nearly all the seamen now hung inactive; hammers,
      bits of plank, lances, and harpoons, mechanically retained in their
      hands, just as they had darted from their various employments; all
      their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale, which from side to side
      strangely vibrating his predestinating head, sent a broad band of
      overspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed. Retribution,
      swift vengeance, eternal malice were in his whole aspect, and spite of
      all that mortal man could do, the solid white buttress of his forehead
      smote the ship’s starboard bow, till men and timbers reeled. Some fell
      flat upon their faces. Like dislodged trucks, the heads of the
      harpooneers aloft shook on their bull-like necks. Through the breach,
      they heard the waters pour, as mountain torrents down a flume.
      
      “The ship! The hearse!—the second hearse!” cried Ahab from the boat;
      “its wood could only be American!”
      
      Diving beneath the settling ship, the whale ran quivering along its
      keel; but turning under water, swiftly shot to the surface again, far
      off the other bow, but within a few yards of Ahab’s boat, where, for a
      time, he lay quiescent.
      
      “I turn my body from the sun. What ho, Tashtego! let me hear thy
      hammer. Oh! ye three unsurrendered spires of mine; thou uncracked keel;
      and only god-bullied hull; thou firm deck, and haughty helm, and
      Pole-pointed prow,—death-glorious ship! must ye then perish, and
      without me? Am I cut off from the last fond pride of meanest
      shipwrecked captains? Oh, lonely death on lonely life! Oh, now I feel
      my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief. Ho, ho! from all your
      furthest bounds, pour ye now in, ye bold billows of my whole foregone
      life, and top this one piled comber of my death! Towards thee I roll,
      thou all-destroying but unconquering whale; to the last I grapple with
      thee; from hell’s heart I stab at thee; for hate’s sake I spit my last
      breath at thee. Sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool!
      and since neither can be mine, let me then tow to pieces, while still
      chasing thee, though tied to thee, thou damned whale! _Thus_, I give up
      the spear!”
      
      The harpoon was darted; the stricken whale flew forward; with igniting
      velocity the line ran through the grooves;—ran foul. Ahab stooped to
      clear it; he did clear it; but the flying turn caught him round the
      neck, and voicelessly as Turkish mutes bowstring their victim, he was
      shot out of the boat, ere the crew knew he was gone. Next instant, the
      heavy eye-splice in the rope’s final end flew out of the stark-empty
      tub, knocked down an oarsman, and smiting the sea, disappeared in its
      depths.
      
      For an instant, the tranced boat’s crew stood still; then turned. “The
      ship? Great God, where is the ship?” Soon they through dim, bewildering
      mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom, as in the gaseous Fata
      Morgana; only the uppermost masts out of water; while fixed by
      infatuation, or fidelity, or fate, to their once lofty perches, the
      pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea.
      And now, concentric circles seized the lone boat itself, and all its
      crew, and each floating oar, and every lance-pole, and spinning,
      animate and inanimate, all round and round in one vortex, carried the
      smallest chip of the Pequod out of sight.
      
      But as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the
      sunken head of the Indian at the mainmast, leaving a few inches of the
      erect spar yet visible, together with long streaming yards of the flag,
      which calmly undulated, with ironical coincidings, over the destroying
      billows they almost touched;—at that instant, a red arm and a hammer
      hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air, in the act of nailing the
      flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar. A sky-hawk that
      tauntingly had followed the main-truck downwards from its natural home
      among the stars, pecking at the flag, and incommoding Tashtego there;
      this bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between
      the hammer and the wood; and simultaneously feeling that etherial
      thrill, the submerged savage beneath, in his death-gasp, kept his
      hammer frozen there; and so the bird of heaven, with archangelic
      shrieks, and his imperial beak thrust upwards, and his whole captive
      form folded in the flag of Ahab, went down with his ship, which, like
      Satan, would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of
      heaven along with her, and helmeted herself with it.
      
      Now small fowls flew screaming over the yet yawning gulf; a sullen
      white surf beat against its steep sides; then all collapsed, and the
      great shroud of the sea rolled on as it rolled five thousand years ago.
      
      
      Epilogue
      
      “AND I ONLY AM ESCAPED ALONE TO TELL THEE” Job.
      
      The drama’s done. Why then here does any one step forth?—Because one
      did survive the wreck.
      
      It so chanced, that after the Parsee’s disappearance, I was he whom the
      Fates ordained to take the place of Ahab’s bowsman, when that bowsman
      assumed the vacant post; the same, who, when on the last day the three
      men were tossed from out of the rocking boat, was dropped astern. So,
      floating on the margin of the ensuing scene, and in full sight of it,
      when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me, I was then, but
      slowly, drawn towards the closing vortex. When I reached it, it had
      subsided to a creamy pool. Round and round, then, and ever contracting
      towards the button-like black bubble at the axis of that slowly
      wheeling circle, like another Ixion I did revolve. Till, gaining that
      vital centre, the black bubble upward burst; and now, liberated by
      reason of its cunning spring, and, owing to its great buoyancy, rising
      with great force, the coffin life-buoy shot lengthwise from the sea,
      fell over, and floated by my side. Buoyed up by that coffin, for almost
      one whole day and night, I floated on a soft and dirgelike main. The
      unharming sharks, they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths;
      the savage sea-hawks sailed with sheathed beaks. On the second day, a
      sail drew near, nearer, and picked me up at last. It was the
      devious-cruising Rachel, that in her retracing search after her missing
      children, only found another orphan.
     
      




      THE GOLDEN BIRD

A certain king had a beautiful garden, and in the garden stood a tree
which bore golden apples. These apples were always counted, and about
the time when they began to grow ripe it was found that every night one
of them was gone. The king became very angry at this, and ordered the
gardener to keep watch all night under the tree. The gardener set his
eldest son to watch; but about twelve o’clock he fell asleep, and in
the morning another of the apples was missing. Then the second son was
ordered to watch; and at midnight he too fell asleep, and in the morning
another apple was gone. Then the third son offered to keep watch; but
the gardener at first would not let him, for fear some harm should come
to him: however, at last he consented, and the young man laid himself
under the tree to watch. As the clock struck twelve he heard a rustling
noise in the air, and a bird came flying that was of pure gold; and as
it was snapping at one of the apples with its beak, the gardener’s son
jumped up and shot an arrow at it. But the arrow did the bird no harm;
only it dropped a golden feather from its tail, and then flew away.
The golden feather was brought to the king in the morning, and all the
council was called together. Everyone agreed that it was worth more than
all the wealth of the kingdom: but the king said, ‘One feather is of no
use to me, I must have the whole bird.’

Then the gardener’s eldest son set out and thought to find the golden
bird very easily; and when he had gone but a little way, he came to a
wood, and by the side of the wood he saw a fox sitting; so he took his
bow and made ready to shoot at it. Then the fox said, ‘Do not shoot me,
for I will give you good counsel; I know what your business is, and
that you want to find the golden bird. You will reach a village in the
evening; and when you get there, you will see two inns opposite to each
other, one of which is very pleasant and beautiful to look at: go not in
there, but rest for the night in the other, though it may appear to you
to be very poor and mean.’ But the son thought to himself, ‘What can
such a beast as this know about the matter?’ So he shot his arrow at
the fox; but he missed it, and it set up its tail above its back and
ran into the wood. Then he went his way, and in the evening came to
the village where the two inns were; and in one of these were people
singing, and dancing, and feasting; but the other looked very dirty,
and poor. ‘I should be very silly,’ said he, ‘if I went to that shabby
house, and left this charming place’; so he went into the smart house,
and ate and drank at his ease, and forgot the bird, and his country too.

Time passed on; and as the eldest son did not come back, and no tidings
were heard of him, the second son set out, and the same thing happened
to him. He met the fox, who gave him the good advice: but when he came
to the two inns, his eldest brother was standing at the window where
the merrymaking was, and called to him to come in; and he could not
withstand the temptation, but went in, and forgot the golden bird and
his country in the same manner.

Time passed on again, and the youngest son too wished to set out into
the wide world to seek for the golden bird; but his father would not
listen to it for a long while, for he was very fond of his son, and
was afraid that some ill luck might happen to him also, and prevent his
coming back. However, at last it was agreed he should go, for he would
not rest at home; and as he came to the wood, he met the fox, and heard
the same good counsel. But he was thankful to the fox, and did not
attempt his life as his brothers had done; so the fox said, ‘Sit upon my
tail, and you will travel faster.’ So he sat down, and the fox began to
run, and away they went over stock and stone so quick that their hair
whistled in the wind.

When they came to the village, the son followed the fox’s counsel, and
without looking about him went to the shabby inn and rested there all
night at his ease. In the morning came the fox again and met him as he
was beginning his journey, and said, ‘Go straight forward, till you come
to a castle, before which lie a whole troop of soldiers fast asleep and
snoring: take no notice of them, but go into the castle and pass on and
on till you come to a room, where the golden bird sits in a wooden cage;
close by it stands a beautiful golden cage; but do not try to take the
bird out of the shabby cage and put it into the handsome one, otherwise
you will repent it.’ Then the fox stretched out his tail again, and the
young man sat himself down, and away they went over stock and stone till
their hair whistled in the wind.

Before the castle gate all was as the fox had said: so the son went in
and found the chamber where the golden bird hung in a wooden cage, and
below stood the golden cage, and the three golden apples that had been
lost were lying close by it. Then thought he to himself, ‘It will be a
very droll thing to bring away such a fine bird in this shabby cage’; so
he opened the door and took hold of it and put it into the golden cage.
But the bird set up such a loud scream that all the soldiers awoke, and
they took him prisoner and carried him before the king. The next morning
the court sat to judge him; and when all was heard, it sentenced him to
die, unless he should bring the king the golden horse which could run as
swiftly as the wind; and if he did this, he was to have the golden bird
given him for his own.

So he set out once more on his journey, sighing, and in great despair,
when on a sudden his friend the fox met him, and said, ‘You see now
what has happened on account of your not listening to my counsel. I will
still, however, tell you how to find the golden horse, if you will do as
I bid you. You must go straight on till you come to the castle where the
horse stands in his stall: by his side will lie the groom fast asleep
and snoring: take away the horse quietly, but be sure to put the old
leathern saddle upon him, and not the golden one that is close by it.’
Then the son sat down on the fox’s tail, and away they went over stock
and stone till their hair whistled in the wind.

All went right, and the groom lay snoring with his hand upon the golden
saddle. But when the son looked at the horse, he thought it a great pity
to put the leathern saddle upon it. ‘I will give him the good one,’
said he; ‘I am sure he deserves it.’ As he took up the golden saddle the
groom awoke and cried out so loud, that all the guards ran in and took
him prisoner, and in the morning he was again brought before the court
to be judged, and was sentenced to die. But it was agreed, that, if he
could bring thither the beautiful princess, he should live, and have the
bird and the horse given him for his own.

Then he went his way very sorrowful; but the old fox came and said, ‘Why
did not you listen to me? If you had, you would have carried away
both the bird and the horse; yet will I once more give you counsel. Go
straight on, and in the evening you will arrive at a castle. At twelve
o’clock at night the princess goes to the bathing-house: go up to her
and give her a kiss, and she will let you lead her away; but take care
you do not suffer her to go and take leave of her father and mother.’
Then the fox stretched out his tail, and so away they went over stock
and stone till their hair whistled again.

As they came to the castle, all was as the fox had said, and at twelve
o’clock the young man met the princess going to the bath and gave her the
kiss, and she agreed to run away with him, but begged with many tears
that he would let her take leave of her father. At first he refused,
but she wept still more and more, and fell at his feet, till at last
he consented; but the moment she came to her father’s house the guards
awoke and he was taken prisoner again.

Then he was brought before the king, and the king said, ‘You shall never
have my daughter unless in eight days you dig away the hill that stops
the view from my window.’ Now this hill was so big that the whole world
could not take it away: and when he had worked for seven days, and had
done very little, the fox came and said. ‘Lie down and go to sleep; I
will work for you.’ And in the morning he awoke and the hill was gone;
so he went merrily to the king, and told him that now that it was
removed he must give him the princess.

Then the king was obliged to keep his word, and away went the young man
and the princess; and the fox came and said to him, ‘We will have all
three, the princess, the horse, and the bird.’ ‘Ah!’ said the young man,
‘that would be a great thing, but how can you contrive it?’

‘If you will only listen,’ said the fox, ‘it can be done. When you come
to the king, and he asks for the beautiful princess, you must say, “Here
she is!” Then he will be very joyful; and you will mount the golden
horse that they are to give you, and put out your hand to take leave of
them; but shake hands with the princess last. Then lift her quickly on
to the horse behind you; clap your spurs to his side, and gallop away as
fast as you can.’

All went right: then the fox said, ‘When you come to the castle where
the bird is, I will stay with the princess at the door, and you will
ride in and speak to the king; and when he sees that it is the right
horse, he will bring out the bird; but you must sit still, and say that
you want to look at it, to see whether it is the true golden bird; and
when you get it into your hand, ride away.’

This, too, happened as the fox said; they carried off the bird, the
princess mounted again, and they rode on to a great wood. Then the fox
came, and said, ‘Pray kill me, and cut off my head and my feet.’ But the
young man refused to do it: so the fox said, ‘I will at any rate give
you good counsel: beware of two things; ransom no one from the gallows,
and sit down by the side of no river.’ Then away he went. ‘Well,’
thought the young man, ‘it is no hard matter to keep that advice.’

He rode on with the princess, till at last he came to the village where
he had left his two brothers. And there he heard a great noise and
uproar; and when he asked what was the matter, the people said, ‘Two men
are going to be hanged.’ As he came nearer, he saw that the two men were
his brothers, who had turned robbers; so he said, ‘Cannot they in any
way be saved?’ But the people said ‘No,’ unless he would bestow all his
money upon the rascals and buy their liberty. Then he did not stay to
think about the matter, but paid what was asked, and his brothers were
given up, and went on with him towards their home.

And as they came to the wood where the fox first met them, it was so
cool and pleasant that the two brothers said, ‘Let us sit down by the
side of the river, and rest a while, to eat and drink.’ So he said,
‘Yes,’ and forgot the fox’s counsel, and sat down on the side of the
river; and while he suspected nothing, they came behind, and threw him
down the bank, and took the princess, the horse, and the bird, and went
home to the king their master, and said. ‘All this have we won by our
labour.’ Then there was great rejoicing made; but the horse would not
eat, the bird would not sing, and the princess wept.

The youngest son fell to the bottom of the river’s bed: luckily it was
nearly dry, but his bones were almost broken, and the bank was so steep
that he could find no way to get out. Then the old fox came once more,
and scolded him for not following his advice; otherwise no evil would
have befallen him: ‘Yet,’ said he, ‘I cannot leave you here, so lay hold
of my tail and hold fast.’ Then he pulled him out of the river, and said
to him, as he got upon the bank, ‘Your brothers have set watch to kill
you, if they find you in the kingdom.’ So he dressed himself as a poor
man, and came secretly to the king’s court, and was scarcely within the
doors when the horse began to eat, and the bird to sing, and the princess
left off weeping. Then he went to the king, and told him all his
brothers’ roguery; and they were seized and punished, and he had the
princess given to him again; and after the king’s death he was heir to
his kingdom.

A long while after, he went to walk one day in the wood, and the old fox
met him, and besought him with tears in his eyes to kill him, and cut
off his head and feet. And at last he did so, and in a moment the
fox was changed into a man, and turned out to be the brother of the
princess, who had been lost a great many many years.




HANS IN LUCK

Some men are born to good luck: all they do or try to do comes
right--all that falls to them is so much gain--all their geese are
swans--all their cards are trumps--toss them which way you will, they
will always, like poor puss, alight upon their legs, and only move on so
much the faster. The world may very likely not always think of them as
they think of themselves, but what care they for the world? what can it
know about the matter?

One of these lucky beings was neighbour Hans. Seven long years he had
worked hard for his master. At last he said, ‘Master, my time is up; I
must go home and see my poor mother once more: so pray pay me my wages
and let me go.’ And the master said, ‘You have been a faithful and good
servant, Hans, so your pay shall be handsome.’ Then he gave him a lump
of silver as big as his head.

Hans took out his pocket-handkerchief, put the piece of silver into it,
threw it over his shoulder, and jogged off on his road homewards. As he
went lazily on, dragging one foot after another, a man came in sight,
trotting gaily along on a capital horse. ‘Ah!’ said Hans aloud, ‘what a
fine thing it is to ride on horseback! There he sits as easy and happy
as if he was at home, in the chair by his fireside; he trips against no
stones, saves shoe-leather, and gets on he hardly knows how.’ Hans did
not speak so softly but the horseman heard it all, and said, ‘Well,
friend, why do you go on foot then?’ ‘Ah!’ said he, ‘I have this load to
carry: to be sure it is silver, but it is so heavy that I can’t hold up
my head, and you must know it hurts my shoulder sadly.’ ‘What do you say
of making an exchange?’ said the horseman. ‘I will give you my horse,
and you shall give me the silver; which will save you a great deal of
trouble in carrying such a heavy load about with you.’ ‘With all my
heart,’ said Hans: ‘but as you are so kind to me, I must tell you one
thing--you will have a weary task to draw that silver about with you.’
However, the horseman got off, took the silver, helped Hans up, gave him
the bridle into one hand and the whip into the other, and said, ‘When
you want to go very fast, smack your lips loudly together, and cry
“Jip!”’

Hans was delighted as he sat on the horse, drew himself up, squared his
elbows, turned out his toes, cracked his whip, and rode merrily off, one
minute whistling a merry tune, and another singing,

‘No care and no sorrow,
A fig for the morrow!
We’ll laugh and be merry,
Sing neigh down derry!’

After a time he thought he should like to go a little faster, so he
smacked his lips and cried ‘Jip!’ Away went the horse full gallop; and
before Hans knew what he was about, he was thrown off, and lay on his
back by the road-side. His horse would have ran off, if a shepherd who
was coming by, driving a cow, had not stopped it. Hans soon came to
himself, and got upon his legs again, sadly vexed, and said to the
shepherd, ‘This riding is no joke, when a man has the luck to get upon
a beast like this that stumbles and flings him off as if it would break
his neck. However, I’m off now once for all: I like your cow now a great
deal better than this smart beast that played me this trick, and has
spoiled my best coat, you see, in this puddle; which, by the by, smells
not very like a nosegay. One can walk along at one’s leisure behind that
cow--keep good company, and have milk, butter, and cheese, every day,
into the bargain. What would I give to have such a prize!’ ‘Well,’ said
the shepherd, ‘if you are so fond of her, I will change my cow for your
horse; I like to do good to my neighbours, even though I lose by it
myself.’ ‘Done!’ said Hans, merrily. ‘What a noble heart that good man
has!’ thought he. Then the shepherd jumped upon the horse, wished Hans
and the cow good morning, and away he rode.

Hans brushed his coat, wiped his face and hands, rested a while, and
then drove off his cow quietly, and thought his bargain a very lucky
one. ‘If I have only a piece of bread (and I certainly shall always be
able to get that), I can, whenever I like, eat my butter and cheese with
it; and when I am thirsty I can milk my cow and drink the milk: and what
can I wish for more?’ When he came to an inn, he halted, ate up all his
bread, and gave away his last penny for a glass of beer. When he had
rested himself he set off again, driving his cow towards his mother’s
village. But the heat grew greater as soon as noon came on, till at
last, as he found himself on a wide heath that would take him more than
an hour to cross, he began to be so hot and parched that his tongue
clave to the roof of his mouth. ‘I can find a cure for this,’ thought
he; ‘now I will milk my cow and quench my thirst’: so he tied her to the
stump of a tree, and held his leathern cap to milk into; but not a drop
was to be had. Who would have thought that this cow, which was to bring
him milk and butter and cheese, was all that time utterly dry? Hans had
not thought of looking to that.

While he was trying his luck in milking, and managing the matter very
clumsily, the uneasy beast began to think him very troublesome; and at
last gave him such a kick on the head as knocked him down; and there he
lay a long while senseless. Luckily a butcher soon came by, driving a
pig in a wheelbarrow. ‘What is the matter with you, my man?’ said the
butcher, as he helped him up. Hans told him what had happened, how he
was dry, and wanted to milk his cow, but found the cow was dry too. Then
the butcher gave him a flask of ale, saying, ‘There, drink and refresh
yourself; your cow will give you no milk: don’t you see she is an old
beast, good for nothing but the slaughter-house?’ ‘Alas, alas!’ said
Hans, ‘who would have thought it? What a shame to take my horse, and
give me only a dry cow! If I kill her, what will she be good for? I hate
cow-beef; it is not tender enough for me. If it were a pig now--like
that fat gentleman you are driving along at his ease--one could do
something with it; it would at any rate make sausages.’ ‘Well,’ said
the butcher, ‘I don’t like to say no, when one is asked to do a kind,
neighbourly thing. To please you I will change, and give you my fine fat
pig for the cow.’ ‘Heaven reward you for your kindness and self-denial!’
said Hans, as he gave the butcher the cow; and taking the pig off the
wheel-barrow, drove it away, holding it by the string that was tied to
its leg.

So on he jogged, and all seemed now to go right with him: he had met
with some misfortunes, to be sure; but he was now well repaid for all.
How could it be otherwise with such a travelling companion as he had at
last got?

The next man he met was a countryman carrying a fine white goose. The
countryman stopped to ask what was o’clock; this led to further chat;
and Hans told him all his luck, how he had so many good bargains, and
how all the world went gay and smiling with him. The countryman then
began to tell his tale, and said he was going to take the goose to a
christening. ‘Feel,’ said he, ‘how heavy it is, and yet it is only eight
weeks old. Whoever roasts and eats it will find plenty of fat upon it,
it has lived so well!’ ‘You’re right,’ said Hans, as he weighed it in
his hand; ‘but if you talk of fat, my pig is no trifle.’ Meantime the
countryman began to look grave, and shook his head. ‘Hark ye!’ said he,
‘my worthy friend, you seem a good sort of fellow, so I can’t help doing
you a kind turn. Your pig may get you into a scrape. In the village I
just came from, the squire has had a pig stolen out of his sty. I was
dreadfully afraid when I saw you that you had got the squire’s pig. If
you have, and they catch you, it will be a bad job for you. The least
they will do will be to throw you into the horse-pond. Can you swim?’

Poor Hans was sadly frightened. ‘Good man,’ cried he, ‘pray get me out
of this scrape. I know nothing of where the pig was either bred or born;
but he may have been the squire’s for aught I can tell: you know this
country better than I do, take my pig and give me the goose.’ ‘I ought
to have something into the bargain,’ said the countryman; ‘give a fat
goose for a pig, indeed! ‘Tis not everyone would do so much for you as
that. However, I will not be hard upon you, as you are in trouble.’ Then
he took the string in his hand, and drove off the pig by a side path;
while Hans went on the way homewards free from care. ‘After all,’
thought he, ‘that chap is pretty well taken in. I don’t care whose pig
it is, but wherever it came from it has been a very good friend to me. I
have much the best of the bargain. First there will be a capital roast;
then the fat will find me in goose-grease for six months; and then there
are all the beautiful white feathers. I will put them into my pillow,
and then I am sure I shall sleep soundly without rocking. How happy my
mother will be! Talk of a pig, indeed! Give me a fine fat goose.’

As he came to the next village, he saw a scissor-grinder with his wheel,
working and singing,

‘O’er hill and o’er dale
So happy I roam,
Work light and live well,
All the world is my home;
Then who so blythe, so merry as I?’

Hans stood looking on for a while, and at last said, ‘You must be well
off, master grinder! you seem so happy at your work.’ ‘Yes,’ said the
other, ‘mine is a golden trade; a good grinder never puts his hand
into his pocket without finding money in it--but where did you get that
beautiful goose?’ ‘I did not buy it, I gave a pig for it.’ ‘And where
did you get the pig?’ ‘I gave a cow for it.’ ‘And the cow?’ ‘I gave a
horse for it.’ ‘And the horse?’ ‘I gave a lump of silver as big as my
head for it.’ ‘And the silver?’ ‘Oh! I worked hard for that seven long
years.’ ‘You have thriven well in the world hitherto,’ said the grinder,
‘now if you could find money in your pocket whenever you put your hand
in it, your fortune would be made.’ ‘Very true: but how is that to be
managed?’ ‘How? Why, you must turn grinder like myself,’ said the other;
‘you only want a grindstone; the rest will come of itself. Here is one
that is but little the worse for wear: I would not ask more than the
value of your goose for it--will you buy?’ ‘How can you ask?’ said
Hans; ‘I should be the happiest man in the world, if I could have money
whenever I put my hand in my pocket: what could I want more? there’s
the goose.’ ‘Now,’ said the grinder, as he gave him a common rough stone
that lay by his side, ‘this is a most capital stone; do but work it well
enough, and you can make an old nail cut with it.’

Hans took the stone, and went his way with a light heart: his eyes
sparkled for joy, and he said to himself, ‘Surely I must have been born
in a lucky hour; everything I could want or wish for comes of itself.
People are so kind; they seem really to think I do them a favour in
letting them make me rich, and giving me good bargains.’

Meantime he began to be tired, and hungry too, for he had given away his
last penny in his joy at getting the cow.

At last he could go no farther, for the stone tired him sadly: and he
dragged himself to the side of a river, that he might take a drink of
water, and rest a while. So he laid the stone carefully by his side on
the bank: but, as he stooped down to drink, he forgot it, pushed it a
little, and down it rolled, plump into the stream.

For a while he watched it sinking in the deep clear water; then sprang
up and danced for joy, and again fell upon his knees and thanked Heaven,
with tears in his eyes, for its kindness in taking away his only plague,
the ugly heavy stone.

‘How happy am I!’ cried he; ‘nobody was ever so lucky as I.’ Then up he
got with a light heart, free from all his troubles, and walked on till
he reached his mother’s house, and told her how very easy the road to
good luck was.




JORINDA AND JORINDEL

There was once an old castle, that stood in the middle of a deep gloomy
wood, and in the castle lived an old fairy. Now this fairy could take
any shape she pleased. All the day long she flew about in the form of
an owl, or crept about the country like a cat; but at night she always
became an old woman again. When any young man came within a hundred
paces of her castle, he became quite fixed, and could not move a step
till she came and set him free; which she would not do till he had given
her his word never to come there again: but when any pretty maiden came
within that space she was changed into a bird, and the fairy put her
into a cage, and hung her up in a chamber in the castle. There were
seven hundred of these cages hanging in the castle, and all with
beautiful birds in them.

Now there was once a maiden whose name was Jorinda. She was prettier
than all the pretty girls that ever were seen before, and a shepherd
lad, whose name was Jorindel, was very fond of her, and they were soon
to be married. One day they went to walk in the wood, that they might be
alone; and Jorindel said, ‘We must take care that we don’t go too near
to the fairy’s castle.’ It was a beautiful evening; the last rays of the
setting sun shone bright through the long stems of the trees upon
the green underwood beneath, and the turtle-doves sang from the tall
birches.

Jorinda sat down to gaze upon the sun; Jorindel sat by her side; and
both felt sad, they knew not why; but it seemed as if they were to be
parted from one another for ever. They had wandered a long way; and when
they looked to see which way they should go home, they found themselves
at a loss to know what path to take.

The sun was setting fast, and already half of its circle had sunk behind
the hill: Jorindel on a sudden looked behind him, and saw through the
bushes that they had, without knowing it, sat down close under the old
walls of the castle. Then he shrank for fear, turned pale, and trembled.
Jorinda was just singing,

‘The ring-dove sang from the willow spray,
Well-a-day! Well-a-day!
He mourn’d for the fate of his darling mate,
Well-a-day!’

when her song stopped suddenly. Jorindel turned to see the reason, and
beheld his Jorinda changed into a nightingale, so that her song ended
with a mournful _jug, jug_. An owl with fiery eyes flew three times
round them, and three times screamed:

‘Tu whu! Tu whu! Tu whu!’

Jorindel could not move; he stood fixed as a stone, and could neither
weep, nor speak, nor stir hand or foot. And now the sun went quite down;
the gloomy night came; the owl flew into a bush; and a moment after the
old fairy came forth pale and meagre, with staring eyes, and a nose and
chin that almost met one another.

She mumbled something to herself, seized the nightingale, and went away
with it in her hand. Poor Jorindel saw the nightingale was gone--but
what could he do? He could not speak, he could not move from the spot
where he stood. At last the fairy came back and sang with a hoarse
voice:

‘Till the prisoner is fast,
And her doom is cast,
There stay! Oh, stay!
When the charm is around her,
And the spell has bound her,
Hie away! away!’

On a sudden Jorindel found himself free. Then he fell on his knees
before the fairy, and prayed her to give him back his dear Jorinda: but
she laughed at him, and said he should never see her again; then she
went her way.

He prayed, he wept, he sorrowed, but all in vain. ‘Alas!’ he said, ‘what
will become of me?’ He could not go back to his own home, so he went to
a strange village, and employed himself in keeping sheep. Many a time
did he walk round and round as near to the hated castle as he dared go,
but all in vain; he heard or saw nothing of Jorinda.

At last he dreamt one night that he found a beautiful purple flower,
and that in the middle of it lay a costly pearl; and he dreamt that he
plucked the flower, and went with it in his hand into the castle, and
that everything he touched with it was disenchanted, and that there he
found his Jorinda again.

In the morning when he awoke, he began to search over hill and dale for
this pretty flower; and eight long days he sought for it in vain: but
on the ninth day, early in the morning, he found the beautiful purple
flower; and in the middle of it was a large dewdrop, as big as a costly
pearl. Then he plucked the flower, and set out and travelled day and
night, till he came again to the castle.

He walked nearer than a hundred paces to it, and yet he did not become
fixed as before, but found that he could go quite close up to the door.
Jorindel was very glad indeed to see this. Then he touched the door with
the flower, and it sprang open; so that he went in through the court,
and listened when he heard so many birds singing. At last he came to the
chamber where the fairy sat, with the seven hundred birds singing in
the seven hundred cages. When she saw Jorindel she was very angry, and
screamed with rage; but she could not come within two yards of him, for
the flower he held in his hand was his safeguard. He looked around at
the birds, but alas! there were many, many nightingales, and how then
should he find out which was his Jorinda? While he was thinking what to
do, he saw the fairy had taken down one of the cages, and was making the
best of her way off through the door. He ran or flew after her, touched
the cage with the flower, and Jorinda stood before him, and threw her
arms round his neck looking as beautiful as ever, as beautiful as when
they walked together in the wood.

Then he touched all the other birds with the flower, so that they all
took their old forms again; and he took Jorinda home, where they were
married, and lived happily together many years: and so did a good many
other lads, whose maidens had been forced to sing in the old fairy’s
cages by themselves, much longer than they liked.




THE TRAVELLING MUSICIANS

An honest farmer had once an ass that had been a faithful servant to him
a great many years, but was now growing old and every day more and more
unfit for work. His master therefore was tired of keeping him and
began to think of putting an end to him; but the ass, who saw that some
mischief was in the wind, took himself slyly off, and began his journey
towards the great city, ‘For there,’ thought he, ‘I may turn musician.’

After he had travelled a little way, he spied a dog lying by the
roadside and panting as if he were tired. ‘What makes you pant so, my
friend?’ said the ass. ‘Alas!’ said the dog, ‘my master was going to
knock me on the head, because I am old and weak, and can no longer make
myself useful to him in hunting; so I ran away; but what can I do to
earn my livelihood?’ ‘Hark ye!’ said the ass, ‘I am going to the great
city to turn musician: suppose you go with me, and try what you can
do in the same way?’ The dog said he was willing, and they jogged on
together.

They had not gone far before they saw a cat sitting in the middle of the
road and making a most rueful face. ‘Pray, my good lady,’ said the ass,
‘what’s the matter with you? You look quite out of spirits!’ ‘Ah, me!’
said the cat, ‘how can one be in good spirits when one’s life is in
danger? Because I am beginning to grow old, and had rather lie at my
ease by the fire than run about the house after the mice, my mistress
laid hold of me, and was going to drown me; and though I have been lucky
enough to get away from her, I do not know what I am to live upon.’
‘Oh,’ said the ass, ‘by all means go with us to the great city; you are
a good night singer, and may make your fortune as a musician.’ The cat
was pleased with the thought, and joined the party.

Soon afterwards, as they were passing by a farmyard, they saw a cock
perched upon a gate, and screaming out with all his might and main.
‘Bravo!’ said the ass; ‘upon my word, you make a famous noise; pray what
is all this about?’ ‘Why,’ said the cock, ‘I was just now saying that
we should have fine weather for our washing-day, and yet my mistress and
the cook don’t thank me for my pains, but threaten to cut off my
head tomorrow, and make broth of me for the guests that are coming
on Sunday!’ ‘Heaven forbid!’ said the ass, ‘come with us Master
Chanticleer; it will be better, at any rate, than staying here to have
your head cut off! Besides, who knows? If we care to sing in tune, we
may get up some kind of a concert; so come along with us.’ ‘With all my
heart,’ said the cock: so they all four went on jollily together.

They could not, however, reach the great city the first day; so when
night came on, they went into a wood to sleep. The ass and the dog laid
themselves down under a great tree, and the cat climbed up into the
branches; while the cock, thinking that the higher he sat the safer he
should be, flew up to the very top of the tree, and then, according to
his custom, before he went to sleep, looked out on all sides of him to
see that everything was well. In doing this, he saw afar off something
bright and shining and calling to his companions said, ‘There must be a
house no great way off, for I see a light.’ ‘If that be the case,’ said
the ass, ‘we had better change our quarters, for our lodging is not the
best in the world!’ ‘Besides,’ added the dog, ‘I should not be the
worse for a bone or two, or a bit of meat.’ So they walked off together
towards the spot where Chanticleer had seen the light, and as they drew
near it became larger and brighter, till they at last came close to a
house in which a gang of robbers lived.

The ass, being the tallest of the company, marched up to the window and
peeped in. ‘Well, Donkey,’ said Chanticleer, ‘what do you see?’ ‘What
do I see?’ replied the ass. ‘Why, I see a table spread with all kinds of
good things, and robbers sitting round it making merry.’ ‘That would
be a noble lodging for us,’ said the cock. ‘Yes,’ said the ass, ‘if we
could only get in’; so they consulted together how they should contrive
to get the robbers out; and at last they hit upon a plan. The ass placed
himself upright on his hind legs, with his forefeet resting against the
window; the dog got upon his back; the cat scrambled up to the dog’s
shoulders, and the cock flew up and sat upon the cat’s head. When
all was ready a signal was given, and they began their music. The ass
brayed, the dog barked, the cat mewed, and the cock screamed; and then
they all broke through the window at once, and came tumbling into
the room, amongst the broken glass, with a most hideous clatter! The
robbers, who had been not a little frightened by the opening concert,
had now no doubt that some frightful hobgoblin had broken in upon them,
and scampered away as fast as they could.

The coast once clear, our travellers soon sat down and dispatched what
the robbers had left, with as much eagerness as if they had not expected
to eat again for a month. As soon as they had satisfied themselves, they
put out the lights, and each once more sought out a resting-place to
his own liking. The donkey laid himself down upon a heap of straw in
the yard, the dog stretched himself upon a mat behind the door, the
cat rolled herself up on the hearth before the warm ashes, and the
cock perched upon a beam on the top of the house; and, as they were all
rather tired with their journey, they soon fell asleep.

But about midnight, when the robbers saw from afar that the lights were
out and that all seemed quiet, they began to think that they had been in
too great a hurry to run away; and one of them, who was bolder than
the rest, went to see what was going on. Finding everything still, he
marched into the kitchen, and groped about till he found a match in
order to light a candle; and then, espying the glittering fiery eyes of
the cat, he mistook them for live coals, and held the match to them to
light it. But the cat, not understanding this joke, sprang at his face,
and spat, and scratched at him. This frightened him dreadfully, and away
he ran to the back door; but there the dog jumped up and bit him in the
leg; and as he was crossing over the yard the ass kicked him; and the
cock, who had been awakened by the noise, crowed with all his might. At
this the robber ran back as fast as he could to his comrades, and told
the captain how a horrid witch had got into the house, and had spat at
him and scratched his face with her long bony fingers; how a man with a
knife in his hand had hidden himself behind the door, and stabbed him
in the leg; how a black monster stood in the yard and struck him with a
club, and how the devil had sat upon the top of the house and cried out,
‘Throw the rascal up here!’ After this the robbers never dared to go
back to the house; but the musicians were so pleased with their quarters
that they took up their abode there; and there they are, I dare say, at
this very day.




OLD SULTAN

A shepherd had a faithful dog, called Sultan, who was grown very old,
and had lost all his teeth. And one day when the shepherd and his wife
were standing together before the house the shepherd said, ‘I will shoot
old Sultan tomorrow morning, for he is of no use now.’ But his wife
said, ‘Pray let the poor faithful creature live; he has served us well a
great many years, and we ought to give him a livelihood for the rest of
his days.’ ‘But what can we do with him?’ said the shepherd, ‘he has not
a tooth in his head, and the thieves don’t care for him at all; to
be sure he has served us, but then he did it to earn his livelihood;
tomorrow shall be his last day, depend upon it.’

Poor Sultan, who was lying close by them, heard all that the shepherd
and his wife said to one another, and was very much frightened to think
tomorrow would be his last day; so in the evening he went to his good
friend the wolf, who lived in the wood, and told him all his sorrows,
and how his master meant to kill him in the morning. ‘Make yourself
easy,’ said the wolf, ‘I will give you some good advice. Your master,
you know, goes out every morning very early with his wife into the
field; and they take their little child with them, and lay it down
behind the hedge in the shade while they are at work. Now do you lie
down close by the child, and pretend to be watching it, and I will come
out of the wood and run away with it; you must run after me as fast as
you can, and I will let it drop; then you may carry it back, and they
will think you have saved their child, and will be so thankful to you
that they will take care of you as long as you live.’ The dog liked this
plan very well; and accordingly so it was managed. The wolf ran with the
child a little way; the shepherd and his wife screamed out; but Sultan
soon overtook him, and carried the poor little thing back to his master
and mistress. Then the shepherd patted him on the head, and said, ‘Old
Sultan has saved our child from the wolf, and therefore he shall live
and be well taken care of, and have plenty to eat. Wife, go home, and
give him a good dinner, and let him have my old cushion to sleep on
as long as he lives.’ So from this time forward Sultan had all that he
could wish for.

Soon afterwards the wolf came and wished him joy, and said, ‘Now, my
good fellow, you must tell no tales, but turn your head the other way
when I want to taste one of the old shepherd’s fine fat sheep.’ ‘No,’
said the Sultan; ‘I will be true to my master.’ However, the wolf
thought he was in joke, and came one night to get a dainty morsel. But
Sultan had told his master what the wolf meant to do; so he laid wait
for him behind the barn door, and when the wolf was busy looking out for
a good fat sheep, he had a stout cudgel laid about his back, that combed
his locks for him finely.

Then the wolf was very angry, and called Sultan ‘an old rogue,’ and
swore he would have his revenge. So the next morning the wolf sent the
boar to challenge Sultan to come into the wood to fight the matter. Now
Sultan had nobody he could ask to be his second but the shepherd’s old
three-legged cat; so he took her with him, and as the poor thing limped
along with some trouble, she stuck up her tail straight in the air.

The wolf and the wild boar were first on the ground; and when they
espied their enemies coming, and saw the cat’s long tail standing
straight in the air, they thought she was carrying a sword for Sultan to
fight with; and every time she limped, they thought she was picking up
a stone to throw at them; so they said they should not like this way of
fighting, and the boar lay down behind a bush, and the wolf jumped
up into a tree. Sultan and the cat soon came up, and looked about and
wondered that no one was there. The boar, however, had not quite hidden
himself, for his ears stuck out of the bush; and when he shook one of
them a little, the cat, seeing something move, and thinking it was a
mouse, sprang upon it, and bit and scratched it, so that the boar jumped
up and grunted, and ran away, roaring out, ‘Look up in the tree, there
sits the one who is to blame.’ So they looked up, and espied the wolf
sitting amongst the branches; and they called him a cowardly rascal,
and would not suffer him to come down till he was heartily ashamed of
himself, and had promised to be good friends again with old Sultan.




THE STRAW, THE COAL, AND THE BEAN

In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish
of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and
that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw.
When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her
observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards
a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw
began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?’ The coal
replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped
by sheer force, my death would have been certain,--I should have been
burnt to ashes.’ The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin,
but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made
into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.’ ‘And would a better
fate have fallen to my lot?’ said the straw. ‘The old woman has
destroyed all my brethren in fire and smoke; she seized sixty of them at
once, and took their lives. I luckily slipped through her fingers.’

‘But what are we to do now?’ said the coal.

‘I think,’ answered the bean, ‘that as we have so fortunately escaped
death, we should keep together like good companions, and lest a new
mischance should overtake us here, we should go away together, and
repair to a foreign country.’

The proposition pleased the two others, and they set out on their way
together. Soon, however, they came to a little brook, and as there was
no bridge or foot-plank, they did not know how they were to get over
it. The straw hit on a good idea, and said: ‘I will lay myself straight
across, and then you can walk over on me as on a bridge.’ The straw
therefore stretched itself from one bank to the other, and the coal,
who was of an impetuous disposition, tripped quite boldly on to the
newly-built bridge. But when she had reached the middle, and heard the
water rushing beneath her, she was after all, afraid, and stood still,
and ventured no farther. The straw, however, began to burn, broke in
two pieces, and fell into the stream. The coal slipped after her, hissed
when she got into the water, and breathed her last. The bean, who had
prudently stayed behind on the shore, could not but laugh at the event,
was unable to stop, and laughed so heartily that she burst. It would
have been all over with her, likewise, if, by good fortune, a tailor who
was travelling in search of work, had not sat down to rest by the brook.
As he had a compassionate heart he pulled out his needle and thread,
and sewed her together. The bean thanked him most prettily, but as the
tailor used black thread, all beans since then have a black seam.




BRIAR ROSE

A king and queen once upon a time reigned in a country a great way off,
where there were in those days fairies. Now this king and queen had
plenty of money, and plenty of fine clothes to wear, and plenty of
good things to eat and drink, and a coach to ride out in every day: but
though they had been married many years they had no children, and this
grieved them very much indeed. But one day as the queen was walking
by the side of the river, at the bottom of the garden, she saw a poor
little fish, that had thrown itself out of the water, and lay gasping
and nearly dead on the bank. Then the queen took pity on the little
fish, and threw it back again into the river; and before it swam away
it lifted its head out of the water and said, ‘I know what your wish is,
and it shall be fulfilled, in return for your kindness to me--you will
soon have a daughter.’ What the little fish had foretold soon came to
pass; and the queen had a little girl, so very beautiful that the king
could not cease looking on it for joy, and said he would hold a great
feast and make merry, and show the child to all the land. So he asked
his kinsmen, and nobles, and friends, and neighbours. But the queen
said, ‘I will have the fairies also, that they might be kind and good
to our little daughter.’ Now there were thirteen fairies in the kingdom;
but as the king and queen had only twelve golden dishes for them to eat
out of, they were forced to leave one of the fairies without asking her.
So twelve fairies came, each with a high red cap on her head, and red
shoes with high heels on her feet, and a long white wand in her hand:
and after the feast was over they gathered round in a ring and gave all
their best gifts to the little princess. One gave her goodness, another
beauty, another riches, and so on till she had all that was good in the
world.

Just as eleven of them had done blessing her, a great noise was heard in
the courtyard, and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy was
come, with a black cap on her head, and black shoes on her feet, and a
broomstick in her hand: and presently up she came into the dining-hall.
Now, as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry, and
scolded the king and queen very much, and set to work to take her
revenge. So she cried out, ‘The king’s daughter shall, in her fifteenth
year, be wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead.’ Then the twelfth of
the friendly fairies, who had not yet given her gift, came forward, and
said that the evil wish must be fulfilled, but that she could soften its
mischief; so her gift was, that the king’s daughter, when the spindle
wounded her, should not really die, but should only fall asleep for a
hundred years.

However, the king hoped still to save his dear child altogether from
the threatened evil; so he ordered that all the spindles in the kingdom
should be bought up and burnt. But all the gifts of the first eleven
fairies were in the meantime fulfilled; for the princess was so
beautiful, and well behaved, and good, and wise, that everyone who knew
her loved her.

It happened that, on the very day she was fifteen years old, the king
and queen were not at home, and she was left alone in the palace. So she
roved about by herself, and looked at all the rooms and chambers, till
at last she came to an old tower, to which there was a narrow staircase
ending with a little door. In the door there was a golden key, and when
she turned it the door sprang open, and there sat an old lady spinning
away very busily. ‘Why, how now, good mother,’ said the princess; ‘what
are you doing there?’ ‘Spinning,’ said the old lady, and nodded her
head, humming a tune, while buzz! went the wheel. ‘How prettily that
little thing turns round!’ said the princess, and took the spindle
and began to try and spin. But scarcely had she touched it, before the
fairy’s prophecy was fulfilled; the spindle wounded her, and she fell
down lifeless on the ground.

However, she was not dead, but had only fallen into a deep sleep; and
the king and the queen, who had just come home, and all their court,
fell asleep too; and the horses slept in the stables, and the dogs in
the court, the pigeons on the house-top, and the very flies slept upon
the walls. Even the fire on the hearth left off blazing, and went to
sleep; the jack stopped, and the spit that was turning about with a
goose upon it for the king’s dinner stood still; and the cook, who was
at that moment pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give him a box
on the ear for something he had done amiss, let him go, and both fell
asleep; the butler, who was slyly tasting the ale, fell asleep with the
jug at his lips: and thus everything stood still, and slept soundly.

A large hedge of thorns soon grew round the palace, and every year it
became higher and thicker; till at last the old palace was surrounded
and hidden, so that not even the roof or the chimneys could be seen. But
there went a report through all the land of the beautiful sleeping Briar
Rose (for so the king’s daughter was called): so that, from time to
time, several kings’ sons came, and tried to break through the thicket
into the palace. This, however, none of them could ever do; for the
thorns and bushes laid hold of them, as it were with hands; and there
they stuck fast, and died wretchedly.

After many, many years there came a king’s son into that land: and an
old man told him the story of the thicket of thorns; and how a beautiful
palace stood behind it, and how a wonderful princess, called Briar Rose,
lay in it asleep, with all her court. He told, too, how he had heard
from his grandfather that many, many princes had come, and had tried to
break through the thicket, but that they had all stuck fast in it, and
died. Then the young prince said, ‘All this shall not frighten me; I
will go and see this Briar Rose.’ The old man tried to hinder him, but
he was bent upon going.

Now that very day the hundred years were ended; and as the prince came
to the thicket he saw nothing but beautiful flowering shrubs, through
which he went with ease, and they shut in after him as thick as ever.
Then he came at last to the palace, and there in the court lay the dogs
asleep; and the horses were standing in the stables; and on the roof sat
the pigeons fast asleep, with their heads under their wings. And when he
came into the palace, the flies were sleeping on the walls; the spit
was standing still; the butler had the jug of ale at his lips, going
to drink a draught; the maid sat with a fowl in her lap ready to be
plucked; and the cook in the kitchen was still holding up her hand, as
if she was going to beat the boy.

Then he went on still farther, and all was so still that he could hear
every breath he drew; till at last he came to the old tower, and opened
the door of the little room in which Briar Rose was; and there she lay,
fast asleep on a couch by the window. She looked so beautiful that he
could not take his eyes off her, so he stooped down and gave her a kiss.
But the moment he kissed her she opened her eyes and awoke, and smiled
upon him; and they went out together; and soon the king and queen also
awoke, and all the court, and gazed on each other with great wonder.
And the horses shook themselves, and the dogs jumped up and barked; the
pigeons took their heads from under their wings, and looked about and
flew into the fields; the flies on the walls buzzed again; the fire in
the kitchen blazed up; round went the jack, and round went the spit,
with the goose for the king’s dinner upon it; the butler finished his
draught of ale; the maid went on plucking the fowl; and the cook gave
the boy the box on his ear.

And then the prince and Briar Rose were married, and the wedding feast
was given; and they lived happily together all their lives long.




THE DOG AND THE SPARROW

A shepherd’s dog had a master who took no care of him, but often let him
suffer the greatest hunger. At last he could bear it no longer; so he
took to his heels, and off he ran in a very sad and sorrowful mood.
On the road he met a sparrow that said to him, ‘Why are you so sad,
my friend?’ ‘Because,’ said the dog, ‘I am very very hungry, and have
nothing to eat.’ ‘If that be all,’ answered the sparrow, ‘come with me
into the next town, and I will soon find you plenty of food.’ So on they
went together into the town: and as they passed by a butcher’s shop,
the sparrow said to the dog, ‘Stand there a little while till I peck you
down a piece of meat.’ So the sparrow perched upon the shelf: and having
first looked carefully about her to see if anyone was watching her, she
pecked and scratched at a steak that lay upon the edge of the shelf,
till at last down it fell. Then the dog snapped it up, and scrambled
away with it into a corner, where he soon ate it all up. ‘Well,’ said
the sparrow, ‘you shall have some more if you will; so come with me to
the next shop, and I will peck you down another steak.’ When the dog had
eaten this too, the sparrow said to him, ‘Well, my good friend, have you
had enough now?’ ‘I have had plenty of meat,’ answered he, ‘but I should
like to have a piece of bread to eat after it.’ ‘Come with me then,’
said the sparrow, ‘and you shall soon have that too.’ So she took him
to a baker’s shop, and pecked at two rolls that lay in the window, till
they fell down: and as the dog still wished for more, she took him to
another shop and pecked down some more for him. When that was eaten, the
sparrow asked him whether he had had enough now. ‘Yes,’ said he; ‘and
now let us take a walk a little way out of the town.’ So they both went
out upon the high road; but as the weather was warm, they had not gone
far before the dog said, ‘I am very much tired--I should like to take a
nap.’ ‘Very well,’ answered the sparrow, ‘do so, and in the meantime
I will perch upon that bush.’ So the dog stretched himself out on the
road, and fell fast asleep. Whilst he slept, there came by a carter with
a cart drawn by three horses, and loaded with two casks of wine. The
sparrow, seeing that the carter did not turn out of the way, but would
go on in the track in which the dog lay, so as to drive over him, called
out, ‘Stop! stop! Mr Carter, or it shall be the worse for you.’ But the
carter, grumbling to himself, ‘You make it the worse for me, indeed!
what can you do?’ cracked his whip, and drove his cart over the poor
dog, so that the wheels crushed him to death. ‘There,’ cried the
sparrow, ‘thou cruel villain, thou hast killed my friend the dog. Now
mind what I say. This deed of thine shall cost thee all thou art worth.’
‘Do your worst, and welcome,’ said the brute, ‘what harm can you do me?’
and passed on. But the sparrow crept under the tilt of the cart, and
pecked at the bung of one of the casks till she loosened it; and then
all the wine ran out, without the carter seeing it. At last he looked
round, and saw that the cart was dripping, and the cask quite empty.
‘What an unlucky wretch I am!’ cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said
the sparrow, as she alighted upon the head of one of the horses, and
pecked at him till he reared up and kicked. When the carter saw this,
he drew out his hatchet and aimed a blow at the sparrow, meaning to kill
her; but she flew away, and the blow fell upon the poor horse’s head
with such force, that he fell down dead. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’
cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said the sparrow. And as the carter
went on with the other two horses, she again crept under the tilt of the
cart, and pecked out the bung of the second cask, so that all the wine
ran out. When the carter saw this, he again cried out, ‘Miserable wretch
that I am!’ But the sparrow answered, ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ and
perched on the head of the second horse, and pecked at him too. The
carter ran up and struck at her again with his hatchet; but away she
flew, and the blow fell upon the second horse and killed him on the
spot. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’ said he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said
the sparrow; and perching upon the third horse, she began to peck him
too. The carter was mad with fury; and without looking about him, or
caring what he was about, struck again at the sparrow; but killed his
third horse as he done the other two. ‘Alas! miserable wretch that I
am!’ cried he. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ answered the sparrow as she flew
away; ‘now will I plague and punish thee at thy own house.’ The
carter was forced at last to leave his cart behind him, and to go home
overflowing with rage and vexation. ‘Alas!’ said he to his wife, ‘what
ill luck has befallen me!--my wine is all spilt, and my horses all three
dead.’ ‘Alas! husband,’ replied she, ‘and a wicked bird has come into
the house, and has brought with her all the birds in the world, I am
sure, and they have fallen upon our corn in the loft, and are eating it
up at such a rate!’ Away ran the husband upstairs, and saw thousands of
birds sitting upon the floor eating up his corn, with the sparrow in the
midst of them. ‘Unlucky wretch that I am!’ cried the carter; for he saw
that the corn was almost all gone. ‘Not wretch enough yet!’ said the
sparrow; ‘thy cruelty shall cost thee thy life yet!’ and away she flew.

The carter seeing that he had thus lost all that he had, went down
into his kitchen; and was still not sorry for what he had done, but sat
himself angrily and sulkily in the chimney corner. But the sparrow sat
on the outside of the window, and cried ‘Carter! thy cruelty shall cost
thee thy life!’ With that he jumped up in a rage, seized his hatchet,
and threw it at the sparrow; but it missed her, and only broke the
window. The sparrow now hopped in, perched upon the window-seat, and
cried, ‘Carter! it shall cost thee thy life!’ Then he became mad and
blind with rage, and struck the window-seat with such force that he
cleft it in two: and as the sparrow flew from place to place, the carter
and his wife were so furious, that they broke all their furniture,
glasses, chairs, benches, the table, and at last the walls, without
touching the bird at all. In the end, however, they caught her: and the
wife said, ‘Shall I kill her at once?’ ‘No,’ cried he, ‘that is letting
her off too easily: she shall die a much more cruel death; I will eat
her.’ But the sparrow began to flutter about, and stretch out her neck
and cried, ‘Carter! it shall cost thee thy life yet!’ With that he
could wait no longer: so he gave his wife the hatchet, and cried, ‘Wife,
strike at the bird and kill her in my hand.’ And the wife struck; but
she missed her aim, and hit her husband on the head so that he fell down
dead, and the sparrow flew quietly home to her nest.




THE TWELVE DANCING PRINCESSES

There was a king who had twelve beautiful daughters. They slept in
twelve beds all in one room; and when they went to bed, the doors were
shut and locked up; but every morning their shoes were found to be quite
worn through as if they had been danced in all night; and yet nobody
could find out how it happened, or where they had been.

Then the king made it known to all the land, that if any person could
discover the secret, and find out where it was that the princesses
danced in the night, he should have the one he liked best for his
wife, and should be king after his death; but whoever tried and did not
succeed, after three days and nights, should be put to death.

A king’s son soon came. He was well entertained, and in the evening was
taken to the chamber next to the one where the princesses lay in their
twelve beds. There he was to sit and watch where they went to dance;
and, in order that nothing might pass without his hearing it, the door
of his chamber was left open. But the king’s son soon fell asleep; and
when he awoke in the morning he found that the princesses had all been
dancing, for the soles of their shoes were full of holes. The same thing
happened the second and third night: so the king ordered his head to be
cut off. After him came several others; but they had all the same luck,
and all lost their lives in the same manner.

Now it chanced that an old soldier, who had been wounded in battle
and could fight no longer, passed through the country where this king
reigned: and as he was travelling through a wood, he met an old woman,
who asked him where he was going. ‘I hardly know where I am going, or
what I had better do,’ said the soldier; ‘but I think I should like very
well to find out where it is that the princesses dance, and then in time
I might be a king.’ ‘Well,’ said the old dame, ‘that is no very hard
task: only take care not to drink any of the wine which one of the
princesses will bring to you in the evening; and as soon as she leaves
you pretend to be fast asleep.’

Then she gave him a cloak, and said, ‘As soon as you put that on
you will become invisible, and you will then be able to follow the
princesses wherever they go.’ When the soldier heard all this good
counsel, he determined to try his luck: so he went to the king, and said
he was willing to undertake the task.

He was as well received as the others had been, and the king ordered
fine royal robes to be given him; and when the evening came he was led
to the outer chamber. Just as he was going to lie down, the eldest of
the princesses brought him a cup of wine; but the soldier threw it all
away secretly, taking care not to drink a drop. Then he laid himself
down on his bed, and in a little while began to snore very loud as if
he was fast asleep. When the twelve princesses heard this they laughed
heartily; and the eldest said, ‘This fellow too might have done a wiser
thing than lose his life in this way!’ Then they rose up and opened
their drawers and boxes, and took out all their fine clothes, and
dressed themselves at the glass, and skipped about as if they were eager
to begin dancing. But the youngest said, ‘I don’t know how it is, while
you are so happy I feel very uneasy; I am sure some mischance will
befall us.’ ‘You simpleton,’ said the eldest, ‘you are always afraid;
have you forgotten how many kings’ sons have already watched in vain?
And as for this soldier, even if I had not given him his sleeping
draught, he would have slept soundly enough.’

When they were all ready, they went and looked at the soldier; but he
snored on, and did not stir hand or foot: so they thought they were
quite safe; and the eldest went up to her own bed and clapped her hands,
and the bed sank into the floor and a trap-door flew open. The soldier
saw them going down through the trap-door one after another, the eldest
leading the way; and thinking he had no time to lose, he jumped up, put
on the cloak which the old woman had given him, and followed them;
but in the middle of the stairs he trod on the gown of the youngest
princess, and she cried out to her sisters, ‘All is not right; someone
took hold of my gown.’ ‘You silly creature!’ said the eldest, ‘it is
nothing but a nail in the wall.’ Then down they all went, and at the
bottom they found themselves in a most delightful grove of trees; and
the leaves were all of silver, and glittered and sparkled beautifully.
The soldier wished to take away some token of the place; so he broke
off a little branch, and there came a loud noise from the tree. Then the
youngest daughter said again, ‘I am sure all is not right--did not you
hear that noise? That never happened before.’ But the eldest said, ‘It
is only our princes, who are shouting for joy at our approach.’

Then they came to another grove of trees, where all the leaves were of
gold; and afterwards to a third, where the leaves were all glittering
diamonds. And the soldier broke a branch from each; and every time there
was a loud noise, which made the youngest sister tremble with fear; but
the eldest still said, it was only the princes, who were crying for joy.
So they went on till they came to a great lake; and at the side of the
lake there lay twelve little boats with twelve handsome princes in them,
who seemed to be waiting there for the princesses.

One of the princesses went into each boat, and the soldier stepped into
the same boat with the youngest. As they were rowing over the lake, the
prince who was in the boat with the youngest princess and the soldier
said, ‘I do not know why it is, but though I am rowing with all my might
we do not get on so fast as usual, and I am quite tired: the boat
seems very heavy today.’ ‘It is only the heat of the weather,’ said the
princess: ‘I feel it very warm too.’

On the other side of the lake stood a fine illuminated castle, from
which came the merry music of horns and trumpets. There they all landed,
and went into the castle, and each prince danced with his princess; and
the soldier, who was all the time invisible, danced with them too; and
when any of the princesses had a cup of wine set by her, he drank it
all up, so that when she put the cup to her mouth it was empty. At this,
too, the youngest sister was terribly frightened, but the eldest always
silenced her. They danced on till three o’clock in the morning, and then
all their shoes were worn out, so that they were obliged to leave off.
The princes rowed them back again over the lake (but this time the
soldier placed himself in the boat with the eldest princess); and on the
opposite shore they took leave of each other, the princesses promising
to come again the next night.

When they came to the stairs, the soldier ran on before the princesses,
and laid himself down; and as the twelve sisters slowly came up very
much tired, they heard him snoring in his bed; so they said, ‘Now all
is quite safe’; then they undressed themselves, put away their fine
clothes, pulled off their shoes, and went to bed. In the morning the
soldier said nothing about what had happened, but determined to see more
of this strange adventure, and went again the second and third night;
and every thing happened just as before; the princesses danced each time
till their shoes were worn to pieces, and then returned home. However,
on the third night the soldier carried away one of the golden cups as a
token of where he had been.

As soon as the time came when he was to declare the secret, he was taken
before the king with the three branches and the golden cup; and the
twelve princesses stood listening behind the door to hear what he would
say. And when the king asked him. ‘Where do my twelve daughters dance at
night?’ he answered, ‘With twelve princes in a castle under ground.’ And
then he told the king all that had happened, and showed him the three
branches and the golden cup which he had brought with him. Then the king
called for the princesses, and asked them whether what the soldier said
was true: and when they saw that they were discovered, and that it was
of no use to deny what had happened, they confessed it all. And the king
asked the soldier which of them he would choose for his wife; and he
answered, ‘I am not very young, so I will have the eldest.’--And they
were married that very day, and the soldier was chosen to be the king’s
heir.




THE FISHERMAN AND HIS WIFE

There was once a fisherman who lived with his wife in a pigsty, close
by the seaside. The fisherman used to go out all day long a-fishing; and
one day, as he sat on the shore with his rod, looking at the sparkling
waves and watching his line, all on a sudden his float was dragged away
deep into the water: and in drawing it up he pulled out a great fish.
But the fish said, ‘Pray let me live! I am not a real fish; I am an
enchanted prince: put me in the water again, and let me go!’ ‘Oh, ho!’
said the man, ‘you need not make so many words about the matter; I will
have nothing to do with a fish that can talk: so swim away, sir, as soon
as you please!’ Then he put him back into the water, and the fish darted
straight down to the bottom, and left a long streak of blood behind him
on the wave.

When the fisherman went home to his wife in the pigsty, he told her how
he had caught a great fish, and how it had told him it was an enchanted
prince, and how, on hearing it speak, he had let it go again. ‘Did not
you ask it for anything?’ said the wife, ‘we live very wretchedly here,
in this nasty dirty pigsty; do go back and tell the fish we want a snug
little cottage.’

The fisherman did not much like the business: however, he went to the
seashore; and when he came back there the water looked all yellow and
green. And he stood at the water’s edge, and said:

‘O man of the sea!
Hearken to me!
My wife Ilsabill
Will have her own will,
And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’

Then the fish came swimming to him, and said, ‘Well, what is her will?
What does your wife want?’ ‘Ah!’ said the fisherman, ‘she says that when
I had caught you, I ought to have asked you for something before I let
you go; she does not like living any longer in the pigsty, and wants
a snug little cottage.’ ‘Go home, then,’ said the fish; ‘she is in the
cottage already!’ So the man went home, and saw his wife standing at the
door of a nice trim little cottage. ‘Come in, come in!’ said she; ‘is
not this much better than the filthy pigsty we had?’ And there was a
parlour, and a bedchamber, and a kitchen; and behind the cottage there
was a little garden, planted with all sorts of flowers and fruits; and
there was a courtyard behind, full of ducks and chickens. ‘Ah!’ said the
fisherman, ‘how happily we shall live now!’ ‘We will try to do so, at
least,’ said his wife.

Everything went right for a week or two, and then Dame Ilsabill said,
‘Husband, there is not near room enough for us in this cottage; the
courtyard and the garden are a great deal too small; I should like to
have a large stone castle to live in: go to the fish again and tell him
to give us a castle.’ ‘Wife,’ said the fisherman, ‘I don’t like to go to
him again, for perhaps he will be angry; we ought to be easy with this
pretty cottage to live in.’ ‘Nonsense!’ said the wife; ‘he will do it
very willingly, I know; go along and try!’

The fisherman went, but his heart was very heavy: and when he came to
the sea, it looked blue and gloomy, though it was very calm; and he went
close to the edge of the waves, and said:

‘O man of the sea!
Hearken to me!
My wife Ilsabill
Will have her own will,
And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’

‘Well, what does she want now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said the man,
dolefully, ‘my wife wants to live in a stone castle.’ ‘Go home, then,’
said the fish; ‘she is standing at the gate of it already.’ So away went
the fisherman, and found his wife standing before the gate of a great
castle. ‘See,’ said she, ‘is not this grand?’ With that they went into
the castle together, and found a great many servants there, and the
rooms all richly furnished, and full of golden chairs and tables; and
behind the castle was a garden, and around it was a park half a
mile long, full of sheep, and goats, and hares, and deer; and in the
courtyard were stables and cow-houses. ‘Well,’ said the man, ‘now we
will live cheerful and happy in this beautiful castle for the rest of
our lives.’ ‘Perhaps we may,’ said the wife; ‘but let us sleep upon it,
before we make up our minds to that.’ So they went to bed.

The next morning when Dame Ilsabill awoke it was broad daylight, and
she jogged the fisherman with her elbow, and said, ‘Get up, husband,
and bestir yourself, for we must be king of all the land.’ ‘Wife, wife,’
said the man, ‘why should we wish to be the king? I will not be king.’
‘Then I will,’ said she. ‘But, wife,’ said the fisherman, ‘how can you
be king--the fish cannot make you a king?’ ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘say
no more about it, but go and try! I will be king.’ So the man went away
quite sorrowful to think that his wife should want to be king. This time
the sea looked a dark grey colour, and was overspread with curling waves
and the ridges of foam as he cried out:

‘O man of the sea!
Hearken to me!
My wife Ilsabill
Will have her own will,
And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’

‘Well, what would she have now?’ said the fish. ‘Alas!’ said the poor
man, ‘my wife wants to be king.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is king
already.’

Then the fisherman went home; and as he came close to the palace he saw
a troop of soldiers, and heard the sound of drums and trumpets. And when
he went in he saw his wife sitting on a throne of gold and diamonds,
with a golden crown upon her head; and on each side of her stood six
fair maidens, each a head taller than the other. ‘Well, wife,’ said the
fisherman, ‘are you king?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am king.’ And when he had
looked at her for a long time, he said, ‘Ah, wife! what a fine thing it
is to be king! Now we shall never have anything more to wish for as long
as we live.’ ‘I don’t know how that may be,’ said she; ‘never is a long
time. I am king, it is true; but I begin to be tired of that, and I
think I should like to be emperor.’ ‘Alas, wife! why should you wish to
be emperor?’ said the fisherman. ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘go to the fish!
I say I will be emperor.’ ‘Ah, wife!’ replied the fisherman, ‘the fish
cannot make an emperor, I am sure, and I should not like to ask him for
such a thing.’ ‘I am king,’ said Ilsabill, ‘and you are my slave; so go
at once!’

So the fisherman was forced to go; and he muttered as he went along,
‘This will come to no good, it is too much to ask; the fish will be
tired at last, and then we shall be sorry for what we have done.’ He
soon came to the seashore; and the water was quite black and muddy, and
a mighty whirlwind blew over the waves and rolled them about, but he
went as near as he could to the water’s brink, and said:

‘O man of the sea!
Hearken to me!
My wife Ilsabill
Will have her own will,
And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’

‘What would she have now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said the fisherman,
‘she wants to be emperor.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is emperor
already.’

So he went home again; and as he came near he saw his wife Ilsabill
sitting on a very lofty throne made of solid gold, with a great crown on
her head full two yards high; and on each side of her stood her guards
and attendants in a row, each one smaller than the other, from the
tallest giant down to a little dwarf no bigger than my finger. And
before her stood princes, and dukes, and earls: and the fisherman went
up to her and said, ‘Wife, are you emperor?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am
emperor.’ ‘Ah!’ said the man, as he gazed upon her, ‘what a fine thing
it is to be emperor!’ ‘Husband,’ said she, ‘why should we stop at being
emperor? I will be pope next.’ ‘O wife, wife!’ said he, ‘how can you be
pope? there is but one pope at a time in Christendom.’ ‘Husband,’ said
she, ‘I will be pope this very day.’ ‘But,’ replied the husband, ‘the
fish cannot make you pope.’ ‘What nonsense!’ said she; ‘if he can make
an emperor, he can make a pope: go and try him.’

So the fisherman went. But when he came to the shore the wind was raging
and the sea was tossed up and down in boiling waves, and the ships were
in trouble, and rolled fearfully upon the tops of the billows. In the
middle of the heavens there was a little piece of blue sky, but towards
the south all was red, as if a dreadful storm was rising. At this sight
the fisherman was dreadfully frightened, and he trembled so that his
knees knocked together: but still he went down near to the shore, and
said:

‘O man of the sea!
Hearken to me!
My wife Ilsabill
Will have her own will,
And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’

‘What does she want now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said the fisherman, ‘my
wife wants to be pope.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish; ‘she is pope already.’

Then the fisherman went home, and found Ilsabill sitting on a throne
that was two miles high. And she had three great crowns on her head, and
around her stood all the pomp and power of the Church. And on each side
of her were two rows of burning lights, of all sizes, the greatest as
large as the highest and biggest tower in the world, and the least no
larger than a small rushlight. ‘Wife,’ said the fisherman, as he looked
at all this greatness, ‘are you pope?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘I am pope.’
‘Well, wife,’ replied he, ‘it is a grand thing to be pope; and now
you must be easy, for you can be nothing greater.’ ‘I will think about
that,’ said the wife. Then they went to bed: but Dame Ilsabill could not
sleep all night for thinking what she should be next. At last, as she
was dropping asleep, morning broke, and the sun rose. ‘Ha!’ thought she,
as she woke up and looked at it through the window, ‘after all I cannot
prevent the sun rising.’ At this thought she was very angry, and wakened
her husband, and said, ‘Husband, go to the fish and tell him I must
be lord of the sun and moon.’ The fisherman was half asleep, but the
thought frightened him so much that he started and fell out of bed.
‘Alas, wife!’ said he, ‘cannot you be easy with being pope?’ ‘No,’
said she, ‘I am very uneasy as long as the sun and moon rise without my
leave. Go to the fish at once!’

Then the man went shivering with fear; and as he was going down to
the shore a dreadful storm arose, so that the trees and the very rocks
shook. And all the heavens became black with stormy clouds, and the
lightnings played, and the thunders rolled; and you might have seen in
the sea great black waves, swelling up like mountains with crowns of
white foam upon their heads. And the fisherman crept towards the sea,
and cried out, as well as he could:

‘O man of the sea!
Hearken to me!
My wife Ilsabill
Will have her own will,
And hath sent me to beg a boon of thee!’

‘What does she want now?’ said the fish. ‘Ah!’ said he, ‘she wants to
be lord of the sun and moon.’ ‘Go home,’ said the fish, ‘to your pigsty
again.’

And there they live to this very day.




THE WILLOW-WREN AND THE BEAR

Once in summer-time the bear and the wolf were walking in the forest,
and the bear heard a bird singing so beautifully that he said: ‘Brother
wolf, what bird is it that sings so well?’ ‘That is the King of birds,’
said the wolf, ‘before whom we must bow down.’ In reality the bird was
the willow-wren. ‘IF that’s the case,’ said the bear, ‘I should very
much like to see his royal palace; come, take me thither.’ ‘That is not
done quite as you seem to think,’ said the wolf; ‘you must wait until
the Queen comes,’ Soon afterwards, the Queen arrived with some food in
her beak, and the lord King came too, and they began to feed their young
ones. The bear would have liked to go at once, but the wolf held him
back by the sleeve, and said: ‘No, you must wait until the lord and lady
Queen have gone away again.’ So they took stock of the hole where the
nest lay, and trotted away. The bear, however, could not rest until he
had seen the royal palace, and when a short time had passed, went to it
again. The King and Queen had just flown out, so he peeped in and saw
five or six young ones lying there. ‘Is that the royal palace?’ cried
the bear; ‘it is a wretched palace, and you are not King’s children, you
are disreputable children!’ When the young wrens heard that, they were
frightfully angry, and screamed: ‘No, that we are not! Our parents are
honest people! Bear, you will have to pay for that!’

The bear and the wolf grew uneasy, and turned back and went into their
holes. The young willow-wrens, however, continued to cry and scream, and
when their parents again brought food they said: ‘We will not so much as
touch one fly’s leg, no, not if we were dying of hunger, until you have
settled whether we are respectable children or not; the bear has been
here and has insulted us!’ Then the old King said: ‘Be easy, he shall
be punished,’ and he at once flew with the Queen to the bear’s cave, and
called in: ‘Old Growler, why have you insulted my children? You shall
suffer for it--we will punish you by a bloody war.’ Thus war was
announced to the Bear, and all four-footed animals were summoned to take
part in it, oxen, asses, cows, deer, and every other animal the earth
contained. And the willow-wren summoned everything which flew in the
air, not only birds, large and small, but midges, and hornets, bees and
flies had to come.

When the time came for the war to begin, the willow-wren sent out spies
to discover who was the enemy’s commander-in-chief. The gnat, who was
the most crafty, flew into the forest where the enemy was assembled,
and hid herself beneath a leaf of the tree where the password was to be
announced. There stood the bear, and he called the fox before him
and said: ‘Fox, you are the most cunning of all animals, you shall be
general and lead us.’ ‘Good,’ said the fox, ‘but what signal shall we
agree upon?’ No one knew that, so the fox said: ‘I have a fine long
bushy tail, which almost looks like a plume of red feathers. When I lift
my tail up quite high, all is going well, and you must charge; but if I
let it hang down, run away as fast as you can.’ When the gnat had heard
that, she flew away again, and revealed everything, down to the minutest
detail, to the willow-wren. When day broke, and the battle was to begin,
all the four-footed animals came running up with such a noise that the
earth trembled. The willow-wren with his army also came flying through
the air with such a humming, and whirring, and swarming that every one
was uneasy and afraid, and on both sides they advanced against each
other. But the willow-wren sent down the hornet, with orders to settle
beneath the fox’s tail, and sting with all his might. When the fox felt
the first string, he started so that he lifted one leg, from pain, but
he bore it, and still kept his tail high in the air; at the second
sting, he was forced to put it down for a moment; at the third, he could
hold out no longer, screamed, and put his tail between his legs. When
the animals saw that, they thought all was lost, and began to flee, each
into his hole, and the birds had won the battle.

Then the King and Queen flew home to their children and cried:
‘Children, rejoice, eat and drink to your heart’s content, we have won
the battle!’ But the young wrens said: ‘We will not eat yet, the bear
must come to the nest, and beg for pardon and say that we are honourable
children, before we will do that.’ Then the willow-wren flew to the
bear’s hole and cried: ‘Growler, you are to come to the nest to my
children, and beg their pardon, or else every rib of your body shall
be broken.’ So the bear crept thither in the greatest fear, and begged
their pardon. And now at last the young wrens were satisfied, and sat
down together and ate and drank, and made merry till quite late into the
night.




THE FROG-PRINCE

One fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs, and went
out to take a walk by herself in a wood; and when she came to a cool
spring of water, that rose in the midst of it, she sat herself down
to rest a while. Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which was her
favourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the air, and
catching it again as it fell. After a time she threw it up so high that
she missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away, and rolled
along upon the ground, till at last it fell down into the spring. The
princess looked into the spring after her ball, but it was very deep, so
deep that she could not see the bottom of it. Then she began to bewail
her loss, and said, ‘Alas! if I could only get my ball again, I would
give all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the
world.’

Whilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said,
‘Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘what can you
do for me, you nasty frog? My golden ball has fallen into the spring.’
The frog said, ‘I want not your pearls, and jewels, and fine clothes;
but if you will love me, and let me live with you and eat from off
your golden plate, and sleep upon your bed, I will bring you your ball
again.’ ‘What nonsense,’ thought the princess, ‘this silly frog is
talking! He can never even get out of the spring to visit me, though
he may be able to get my ball for me, and therefore I will tell him he
shall have what he asks.’ So she said to the frog, ‘Well, if you will
bring me my ball, I will do all you ask.’ Then the frog put his head
down, and dived deep under the water; and after a little while he came
up again, with the ball in his mouth, and threw it on the edge of the
spring. As soon as the young princess saw her ball, she ran to pick
it up; and she was so overjoyed to have it in her hand again, that she
never thought of the frog, but ran home with it as fast as she could.
The frog called after her, ‘Stay, princess, and take me with you as you
said,’ But she did not stop to hear a word.

The next day, just as the princess had sat down to dinner, she heard a
strange noise--tap, tap--plash, plash--as if something was coming up the
marble staircase: and soon afterwards there was a gentle knock at the
door, and a little voice cried out and said:

‘Open the door, my princess dear,
Open the door to thy true love here!
And mind the words that thou and I said
By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’

Then the princess ran to the door and opened it, and there she saw
the frog, whom she had quite forgotten. At this sight she was sadly
frightened, and shutting the door as fast as she could came back to her
seat. The king, her father, seeing that something had frightened her,
asked her what was the matter. ‘There is a nasty frog,’ said she, ‘at
the door, that lifted my ball for me out of the spring this morning: I
told him that he should live with me here, thinking that he could never
get out of the spring; but there he is at the door, and he wants to come
in.’

While she was speaking the frog knocked again at the door, and said:

‘Open the door, my princess dear,
Open the door to thy true love here!
And mind the words that thou and I said
By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’

Then the king said to the young princess, ‘As you have given your word
you must keep it; so go and let him in.’ She did so, and the frog hopped
into the room, and then straight on--tap, tap--plash, plash--from the
bottom of the room to the top, till he came up close to the table where
the princess sat. ‘Pray lift me upon chair,’ said he to the princess,
‘and let me sit next to you.’ As soon as she had done this, the frog
said, ‘Put your plate nearer to me, that I may eat out of it.’ This
she did, and when he had eaten as much as he could, he said, ‘Now I am
tired; carry me upstairs, and put me into your bed.’ And the princess,
though very unwilling, took him up in her hand, and put him upon the
pillow of her own bed, where he slept all night long. As soon as it was
light he jumped up, hopped downstairs, and went out of the house.
‘Now, then,’ thought the princess, ‘at last he is gone, and I shall be
troubled with him no more.’

But she was mistaken; for when night came again she heard the same
tapping at the door; and the frog came once more, and said:

‘Open the door, my princess dear,
Open the door to thy true love here!
And mind the words that thou and I said
By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade.’

And when the princess opened the door the frog came in, and slept upon
her pillow as before, till the morning broke. And the third night he did
the same. But when the princess awoke on the following morning she was
astonished to see, instead of the frog, a handsome prince, gazing on her
with the most beautiful eyes she had ever seen, and standing at the head
of her bed.

He told her that he had been enchanted by a spiteful fairy, who had
changed him into a frog; and that he had been fated so to abide till
some princess should take him out of the spring, and let him eat from
her plate, and sleep upon her bed for three nights. ‘You,’ said the
prince, ‘have broken his cruel charm, and now I have nothing to wish for
but that you should go with me into my father’s kingdom, where I will
marry you, and love you as long as you live.’

The young princess, you may be sure, was not long in saying ‘Yes’ to
all this; and as they spoke a gay coach drove up, with eight beautiful
horses, decked with plumes of feathers and a golden harness; and behind
the coach rode the prince’s servant, faithful Heinrich, who had bewailed
the misfortunes of his dear master during his enchantment so long and so
bitterly, that his heart had well-nigh burst.

They then took leave of the king, and got into the coach with eight
horses, and all set out, full of joy and merriment, for the prince’s
kingdom, which they reached safely; and there they lived happily a great
many years.




CAT AND MOUSE IN PARTNERSHIP

A certain cat had made the acquaintance of a mouse, and had said so much
to her about the great love and friendship she felt for her, that at
length the mouse agreed that they should live and keep house together.
‘But we must make a provision for winter, or else we shall suffer
from hunger,’ said the cat; ‘and you, little mouse, cannot venture
everywhere, or you will be caught in a trap some day.’ The good advice
was followed, and a pot of fat was bought, but they did not know where
to put it. At length, after much consideration, the cat said: ‘I know no
place where it will be better stored up than in the church, for no one
dares take anything away from there. We will set it beneath the altar,
and not touch it until we are really in need of it.’ So the pot was
placed in safety, but it was not long before the cat had a great
yearning for it, and said to the mouse: ‘I want to tell you something,
little mouse; my cousin has brought a little son into the world, and has
asked me to be godmother; he is white with brown spots, and I am to hold
him over the font at the christening. Let me go out today, and you look
after the house by yourself.’ ‘Yes, yes,’ answered the mouse, ‘by all
means go, and if you get anything very good to eat, think of me. I
should like a drop of sweet red christening wine myself.’ All this,
however, was untrue; the cat had no cousin, and had not been asked to
be godmother. She went straight to the church, stole to the pot of fat,
began to lick at it, and licked the top of the fat off. Then she took a
walk upon the roofs of the town, looked out for opportunities, and then
stretched herself in the sun, and licked her lips whenever she thought
of the pot of fat, and not until it was evening did she return home.
‘Well, here you are again,’ said the mouse, ‘no doubt you have had a
merry day.’ ‘All went off well,’ answered the cat. ‘What name did they
give the child?’ ‘Top off!’ said the cat quite coolly. ‘Top off!’ cried
the mouse, ‘that is a very odd and uncommon name, is it a usual one in
your family?’ ‘What does that matter,’ said the cat, ‘it is no worse
than Crumb-stealer, as your godchildren are called.’

Before long the cat was seized by another fit of yearning. She said to
the mouse: ‘You must do me a favour, and once more manage the house for
a day alone. I am again asked to be godmother, and, as the child has a
white ring round its neck, I cannot refuse.’ The good mouse consented,
but the cat crept behind the town walls to the church, and devoured
half the pot of fat. ‘Nothing ever seems so good as what one keeps to
oneself,’ said she, and was quite satisfied with her day’s work. When
she went home the mouse inquired: ‘And what was the child christened?’
‘Half-done,’ answered the cat. ‘Half-done! What are you saying? I
never heard the name in my life, I’ll wager anything it is not in the
calendar!’

The cat’s mouth soon began to water for some more licking. ‘All good
things go in threes,’ said she, ‘I am asked to stand godmother again.
The child is quite black, only it has white paws, but with that
exception, it has not a single white hair on its whole body; this only
happens once every few years, you will let me go, won’t you?’ ‘Top-off!
Half-done!’ answered the mouse, ‘they are such odd names, they make me
very thoughtful.’ ‘You sit at home,’ said the cat, ‘in your dark-grey
fur coat and long tail, and are filled with fancies, that’s because
you do not go out in the daytime.’ During the cat’s absence the mouse
cleaned the house, and put it in order, but the greedy cat entirely
emptied the pot of fat. ‘When everything is eaten up one has some
peace,’ said she to herself, and well filled and fat she did not return
home till night. The mouse at once asked what name had been given to
the third child. ‘It will not please you more than the others,’ said the
cat. ‘He is called All-gone.’ ‘All-gone,’ cried the mouse ‘that is the
most suspicious name of all! I have never seen it in print. All-gone;
what can that mean?’ and she shook her head, curled herself up, and lay
down to sleep.

From this time forth no one invited the cat to be godmother, but
when the winter had come and there was no longer anything to be found
outside, the mouse thought of their provision, and said: ‘Come, cat,
we will go to our pot of fat which we have stored up for ourselves--we
shall enjoy that.’ ‘Yes,’ answered the cat, ‘you will enjoy it as much
as you would enjoy sticking that dainty tongue of yours out of the
window.’ They set out on their way, but when they arrived, the pot of
fat certainly was still in its place, but it was empty. ‘Alas!’ said the
mouse, ‘now I see what has happened, now it comes to light! You are a true
friend! You have devoured all when you were standing godmother. First
top off, then half-done, then--’ ‘Will you hold your tongue,’ cried the
cat, ‘one word more, and I will eat you too.’ ‘All-gone’ was already on
the poor mouse’s lips; scarcely had she spoken it before the cat sprang
on her, seized her, and swallowed her down. Verily, that is the way of
the world.




THE GOOSE-GIRL

The king of a great land died, and left his queen to take care of their
only child. This child was a daughter, who was very beautiful; and her
mother loved her dearly, and was very kind to her. And there was a good
fairy too, who was fond of the princess, and helped her mother to watch
over her. When she grew up, she was betrothed to a prince who lived a
great way off; and as the time drew near for her to be married, she
got ready to set off on her journey to his country. Then the queen her
mother, packed up a great many costly things; jewels, and gold, and
silver; trinkets, fine dresses, and in short everything that became a
royal bride. And she gave her a waiting-maid to ride with her, and give
her into the bridegroom’s hands; and each had a horse for the journey.
Now the princess’s horse was the fairy’s gift, and it was called Falada,
and could speak.

When the time came for them to set out, the fairy went into her
bed-chamber, and took a little knife, and cut off a lock of her hair,
and gave it to the princess, and said, ‘Take care of it, dear child; for
it is a charm that may be of use to you on the road.’ Then they all took
a sorrowful leave of the princess; and she put the lock of hair into
her bosom, got upon her horse, and set off on her journey to her
bridegroom’s kingdom.

One day, as they were riding along by a brook, the princess began to
feel very thirsty: and she said to her maid, ‘Pray get down, and fetch
me some water in my golden cup out of yonder brook, for I want to
drink.’ ‘Nay,’ said the maid, ‘if you are thirsty, get off yourself, and
stoop down by the water and drink; I shall not be your waiting-maid any
longer.’ Then she was so thirsty that she got down, and knelt over the
little brook, and drank; for she was frightened, and dared not bring out
her golden cup; and she wept and said, ‘Alas! what will become of me?’
And the lock answered her, and said:

‘Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,
Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’

But the princess was very gentle and meek, so she said nothing to her
maid’s ill behaviour, but got upon her horse again.

Then all rode farther on their journey, till the day grew so warm, and
the sun so scorching, that the bride began to feel very thirsty again;
and at last, when they came to a river, she forgot her maid’s rude
speech, and said, ‘Pray get down, and fetch me some water to drink in
my golden cup.’ But the maid answered her, and even spoke more haughtily
than before: ‘Drink if you will, but I shall not be your waiting-maid.’
Then the princess was so thirsty that she got off her horse, and lay
down, and held her head over the running stream, and cried and said,
‘What will become of me?’ And the lock of hair answered her again:

‘Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,
Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’

And as she leaned down to drink, the lock of hair fell from her bosom,
and floated away with the water. Now she was so frightened that she did
not see it; but her maid saw it, and was very glad, for she knew the
charm; and she saw that the poor bride would be in her power, now that
she had lost the hair. So when the bride had done drinking, and would
have got upon Falada again, the maid said, ‘I shall ride upon Falada,
and you may have my horse instead’; so she was forced to give up her
horse, and soon afterwards to take off her royal clothes and put on her
maid’s shabby ones.

At last, as they drew near the end of their journey, this treacherous
servant threatened to kill her mistress if she ever told anyone what had
happened. But Falada saw it all, and marked it well.

Then the waiting-maid got upon Falada, and the real bride rode upon the
other horse, and they went on in this way till at last they came to the
royal court. There was great joy at their coming, and the prince flew to
meet them, and lifted the maid from her horse, thinking she was the one
who was to be his wife; and she was led upstairs to the royal chamber;
but the true princess was told to stay in the court below.

Now the old king happened just then to have nothing else to do; so he
amused himself by sitting at his kitchen window, looking at what was
going on; and he saw her in the courtyard. As she looked very pretty,
and too delicate for a waiting-maid, he went up into the royal chamber
to ask the bride who it was she had brought with her, that was thus left
standing in the court below. ‘I brought her with me for the sake of her
company on the road,’ said she; ‘pray give the girl some work to do,
that she may not be idle.’ The old king could not for some time think
of any work for her to do; but at last he said, ‘I have a lad who takes
care of my geese; she may go and help him.’ Now the name of this lad,
that the real bride was to help in watching the king’s geese, was
Curdken.

But the false bride said to the prince, ‘Dear husband, pray do me one
piece of kindness.’ ‘That I will,’ said the prince. ‘Then tell one of
your slaughterers to cut off the head of the horse I rode upon, for it
was very unruly, and plagued me sadly on the road’; but the truth was,
she was very much afraid lest Falada should some day or other speak, and
tell all she had done to the princess. She carried her point, and the
faithful Falada was killed; but when the true princess heard of it, she
wept, and begged the man to nail up Falada’s head against a large
dark gate of the city, through which she had to pass every morning
and evening, that there she might still see him sometimes. Then the
slaughterer said he would do as she wished; and cut off the head, and
nailed it up under the dark gate.

Early the next morning, as she and Curdken went out through the gate,
she said sorrowfully:

‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’

and the head answered:

‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!
Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,
Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’

Then they went out of the city, and drove the geese on. And when she
came to the meadow, she sat down upon a bank there, and let down her
waving locks of hair, which were all of pure silver; and when Curdken
saw it glitter in the sun, he ran up, and would have pulled some of the
locks out, but she cried:

‘Blow, breezes, blow!
Let Curdken’s hat go!
Blow, breezes, blow!
Let him after it go!
O’er hills, dales, and rocks,
Away be it whirl’d
Till the silvery locks
Are all comb’d and curl’d!

Then there came a wind, so strong that it blew off Curdken’s hat; and
away it flew over the hills: and he was forced to turn and run after
it; till, by the time he came back, she had done combing and curling her
hair, and had put it up again safe. Then he was very angry and sulky,
and would not speak to her at all; but they watched the geese until it
grew dark in the evening, and then drove them homewards.

The next morning, as they were going through the dark gate, the poor
girl looked up at Falada’s head, and cried:

‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’

and the head answered:

‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!
Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,
Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’

Then she drove on the geese, and sat down again in the meadow, and began
to comb out her hair as before; and Curdken ran up to her, and wanted to
take hold of it; but she cried out quickly:

‘Blow, breezes, blow!
Let Curdken’s hat go!
Blow, breezes, blow!
Let him after it go!
O’er hills, dales, and rocks,
Away be it whirl’d
Till the silvery locks
Are all comb’d and curl’d!

Then the wind came and blew away his hat; and off it flew a great way,
over the hills and far away, so that he had to run after it; and when
he came back she had bound up her hair again, and all was safe. So they
watched the geese till it grew dark.

In the evening, after they came home, Curdken went to the old king, and
said, ‘I cannot have that strange girl to help me to keep the geese any
longer.’ ‘Why?’ said the king. ‘Because, instead of doing any good, she
does nothing but tease me all day long.’ Then the king made him tell him
what had happened. And Curdken said, ‘When we go in the morning through
the dark gate with our flock of geese, she cries and talks with the head
of a horse that hangs upon the wall, and says:

‘Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!’

and the head answers:

‘Bride, bride, there thou gangest!
Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,
Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.’

And Curdken went on telling the king what had happened upon the meadow
where the geese fed; how his hat was blown away; and how he was forced
to run after it, and to leave his flock of geese to themselves. But the
old king told the boy to go out again the next day: and when morning
came, he placed himself behind the dark gate, and heard how she spoke
to Falada, and how Falada answered. Then he went into the field, and
hid himself in a bush by the meadow’s side; and he soon saw with his own
eyes how they drove the flock of geese; and how, after a little time,
she let down her hair that glittered in the sun. And then he heard her
say:

‘Blow, breezes, blow!
Let Curdken’s hat go!
Blow, breezes, blow!
Let him after it go!
O’er hills, dales, and rocks,
Away be it whirl’d
Till the silvery locks
Are all comb’d and curl’d!

And soon came a gale of wind, and carried away Curdken’s hat, and away
went Curdken after it, while the girl went on combing and curling her
hair. All this the old king saw: so he went home without being seen; and
when the little goose-girl came back in the evening he called her aside,
and asked her why she did so: but she burst into tears, and said, ‘That
I must not tell you or any man, or I shall lose my life.’

But the old king begged so hard, that she had no peace till she had told
him all the tale, from beginning to end, word for word. And it was very
lucky for her that she did so, for when she had done the king ordered
royal clothes to be put upon her, and gazed on her with wonder, she was
so beautiful. Then he called his son and told him that he had only a
false bride; for that she was merely a waiting-maid, while the true
bride stood by. And the young king rejoiced when he saw her beauty, and
heard how meek and patient she had been; and without saying anything to
the false bride, the king ordered a great feast to be got ready for all
his court. The bridegroom sat at the top, with the false princess on one
side, and the true one on the other; but nobody knew her again, for her
beauty was quite dazzling to their eyes; and she did not seem at all
like the little goose-girl, now that she had her brilliant dress on.

When they had eaten and drank, and were very merry, the old king said
he would tell them a tale. So he began, and told all the story of the
princess, as if it was one that he had once heard; and he asked the
true waiting-maid what she thought ought to be done to anyone who would
behave thus. ‘Nothing better,’ said this false bride, ‘than that she
should be thrown into a cask stuck round with sharp nails, and that
two white horses should be put to it, and should drag it from street to
street till she was dead.’ ‘Thou art she!’ said the old king; ‘and as
thou has judged thyself, so shall it be done to thee.’ And the young
king was then married to his true wife, and they reigned over the
kingdom in peace and happiness all their lives; and the good fairy came
to see them, and restored the faithful Falada to life again.




THE ADVENTURES OF CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET


1. HOW THEY WENT TO THE MOUNTAINS TO EAT NUTS

‘The nuts are quite ripe now,’ said Chanticleer to his wife Partlet,
‘suppose we go together to the mountains, and eat as many as we can,
before the squirrel takes them all away.’ ‘With all my heart,’ said
Partlet, ‘let us go and make a holiday of it together.’

So they went to the mountains; and as it was a lovely day, they stayed
there till the evening. Now, whether it was that they had eaten so many
nuts that they could not walk, or whether they were lazy and would not,
I do not know: however, they took it into their heads that it did not
become them to go home on foot. So Chanticleer began to build a little
carriage of nutshells: and when it was finished, Partlet jumped into
it and sat down, and bid Chanticleer harness himself to it and draw her
home. ‘That’s a good joke!’ said Chanticleer; ‘no, that will never do;
I had rather by half walk home; I’ll sit on the box and be coachman,
if you like, but I’ll not draw.’ While this was passing, a duck came
quacking up and cried out, ‘You thieving vagabonds, what business have
you in my grounds? I’ll give it you well for your insolence!’ and upon
that she fell upon Chanticleer most lustily. But Chanticleer was no
coward, and returned the duck’s blows with his sharp spurs so fiercely
that she soon began to cry out for mercy; which was only granted her
upon condition that she would draw the carriage home for them. This she
agreed to do; and Chanticleer got upon the box, and drove, crying, ‘Now,
duck, get on as fast as you can.’ And away they went at a pretty good
pace.

After they had travelled along a little way, they met a needle and a pin
walking together along the road: and the needle cried out, ‘Stop, stop!’
and said it was so dark that they could hardly find their way, and such
dirty walking they could not get on at all: he told them that he and his
friend, the pin, had been at a public-house a few miles off, and had sat
drinking till they had forgotten how late it was; he begged therefore
that the travellers would be so kind as to give them a lift in their
carriage. Chanticleer observing that they were but thin fellows, and not
likely to take up much room, told them they might ride, but made them
promise not to dirty the wheels of the carriage in getting in, nor to
tread on Partlet’s toes.

Late at night they arrived at an inn; and as it was bad travelling in
the dark, and the duck seemed much tired, and waddled about a good
deal from one side to the other, they made up their minds to fix their
quarters there: but the landlord at first was unwilling, and said his
house was full, thinking they might not be very respectable company:
however, they spoke civilly to him, and gave him the egg which Partlet
had laid by the way, and said they would give him the duck, who was in
the habit of laying one every day: so at last he let them come in, and
they bespoke a handsome supper, and spent the evening very jollily.

Early in the morning, before it was quite light, and when nobody was
stirring in the inn, Chanticleer awakened his wife, and, fetching the
egg, they pecked a hole in it, ate it up, and threw the shells into the
fireplace: they then went to the pin and needle, who were fast asleep,
and seizing them by the heads, stuck one into the landlord’s easy chair
and the other into his handkerchief; and, having done this, they crept
away as softly as possible. However, the duck, who slept in the open
air in the yard, heard them coming, and jumping into the brook which ran
close by the inn, soon swam out of their reach.

An hour or two afterwards the landlord got up, and took his handkerchief
to wipe his face, but the pin ran into him and pricked him: then he
walked into the kitchen to light his pipe at the fire, but when he
stirred it up the eggshells flew into his eyes, and almost blinded him.
‘Bless me!’ said he, ‘all the world seems to have a design against my
head this morning’: and so saying, he threw himself sulkily into his
easy chair; but, oh dear! the needle ran into him; and this time the
pain was not in his head. He now flew into a very great passion, and,
suspecting the company who had come in the night before, he went to look
after them, but they were all off; so he swore that he never again
would take in such a troop of vagabonds, who ate a great deal, paid no
reckoning, and gave him nothing for his trouble but their apish tricks.


2. HOW CHANTICLEER AND PARTLET WENT TO VISIT MR KORBES

Another day, Chanticleer and Partlet wished to ride out together;
so Chanticleer built a handsome carriage with four red wheels, and
harnessed six mice to it; and then he and Partlet got into the carriage,
and away they drove. Soon afterwards a cat met them, and said, ‘Where
are you going?’ And Chanticleer replied,

‘All on our way
A visit to pay
To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.’

Then the cat said, ‘Take me with you,’ Chanticleer said, ‘With all my
heart: get up behind, and be sure you do not fall off.’

‘Take care of this handsome coach of mine,
Nor dirty my pretty red wheels so fine!
Now, mice, be ready,
And, wheels, run steady!
For we are going a visit to pay
To Mr Korbes, the fox, today.’

Soon after came up a millstone, an egg, a duck, and a pin; and
Chanticleer gave them all leave to get into the carriage and go with
them.

When they arrived at Mr Korbes’s house, he was not at home; so the mice
drew the carriage into the coach-house, Chanticleer and Partlet flew
upon a beam, the cat sat down in the fireplace, the duck got into
the washing cistern, the pin stuck himself into the bed pillow, the
millstone laid himself over the house door, and the egg rolled himself
up in the towel.

When Mr Korbes came home, he went to the fireplace to make a fire; but
the cat threw all the ashes in his eyes: so he ran to the kitchen to
wash himself; but there the duck splashed all the water in his face; and
when he tried to wipe himself, the egg broke to pieces in the towel all
over his face and eyes. Then he was very angry, and went without his
supper to bed; but when he laid his head on the pillow, the pin ran into
his cheek: at this he became quite furious, and, jumping up, would have
run out of the house; but when he came to the door, the millstone fell
down on his head, and killed him on the spot.


3. HOW PARTLET DIED AND WAS BURIED, AND HOW CHANTICLEER DIED OF GRIEF

Another day Chanticleer and Partlet agreed to go again to the mountains
to eat nuts; and it was settled that all the nuts which they found
should be shared equally between them. Now Partlet found a very large
nut; but she said nothing about it to Chanticleer, and kept it all to
herself: however, it was so big that she could not swallow it, and it
stuck in her throat. Then she was in a great fright, and cried out to
Chanticleer, ‘Pray run as fast as you can, and fetch me some water, or I
shall be choked.’ Chanticleer ran as fast as he could to the river, and
said, ‘River, give me some water, for Partlet lies in the mountain, and
will be choked by a great nut.’ The river said, ‘Run first to the bride,
and ask her for a silken cord to draw up the water.’ Chanticleer ran to
the bride, and said, ‘Bride, you must give me a silken cord, for then
the river will give me water, and the water I will carry to Partlet, who
lies on the mountain, and will be choked by a great nut.’ But the bride
said, ‘Run first, and bring me my garland that is hanging on a willow
in the garden.’ Then Chanticleer ran to the garden, and took the garland
from the bough where it hung, and brought it to the bride; and then
the bride gave him the silken cord, and he took the silken cord to
the river, and the river gave him water, and he carried the water to
Partlet; but in the meantime she was choked by the great nut, and lay
quite dead, and never moved any more.

Then Chanticleer was very sorry, and cried bitterly; and all the beasts
came and wept with him over poor Partlet. And six mice built a little
hearse to carry her to her grave; and when it was ready they harnessed
themselves before it, and Chanticleer drove them. On the way they
met the fox. ‘Where are you going, Chanticleer?’ said he. ‘To bury my
Partlet,’ said the other. ‘May I go with you?’ said the fox. ‘Yes; but
you must get up behind, or my horses will not be able to draw you.’ Then
the fox got up behind; and presently the wolf, the bear, the goat, and
all the beasts of the wood, came and climbed upon the hearse.

So on they went till they came to a rapid stream. ‘How shall we get
over?’ said Chanticleer. Then said a straw, ‘I will lay myself across,
and you may pass over upon me.’ But as the mice were going over, the
straw slipped away and fell into the water, and the six mice all fell in
and were drowned. What was to be done? Then a large log of wood came
and said, ‘I am big enough; I will lay myself across the stream, and you
shall pass over upon me.’ So he laid himself down; but they managed
so clumsily, that the log of wood fell in and was carried away by the
stream. Then a stone, who saw what had happened, came up and kindly
offered to help poor Chanticleer by laying himself across the stream;
and this time he got safely to the other side with the hearse, and
managed to get Partlet out of it; but the fox and the other mourners,
who were sitting behind, were too heavy, and fell back into the water
and were all carried away by the stream and drowned.

Thus Chanticleer was left alone with his dead Partlet; and having dug
a grave for her, he laid her in it, and made a little hillock over her.
Then he sat down by the grave, and wept and mourned, till at last he
died too; and so all were dead.




RAPUNZEL

There were once a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a
child. At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire.
These people had a little window at the back of their house from which
a splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful
flowers and herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no
one dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had
great power and was dreaded by all the world. One day the woman was
standing by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a
bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion (rapunzel), and it
looked so fresh and green that she longed for it, she quite pined away,
and began to look pale and miserable. Then her husband was alarmed, and
asked: ‘What ails you, dear wife?’ ‘Ah,’ she replied, ‘if I can’t eat
some of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, I shall
die.’ The man, who loved her, thought: ‘Sooner than let your wife die,
bring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will.’
At twilight, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the
enchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his
wife. She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily. It
tasted so good to her--so very good, that the next day she longed for it
three times as much as before. If he was to have any rest, her husband
must once more descend into the garden. In the gloom of evening
therefore, he let himself down again; but when he had clambered down the
wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before
him. ‘How can you dare,’ said she with angry look, ‘descend into my
garden and steal my rampion like a thief? You shall suffer for it!’
‘Ah,’ answered he, ‘let mercy take the place of justice, I only made
up my mind to do it out of necessity. My wife saw your rampion from the
window, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she
had not got some to eat.’ Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be
softened, and said to him: ‘If the case be as you say, I will allow
you to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one
condition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring into
the world; it shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a
mother.’ The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the
woman was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the
child the name of Rapunzel, and took it away with her.

Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun. When she was
twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay in
a forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a
little window. When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself
beneath it and cried:

‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
Let down your hair to me.’

Rapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she
heard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresses,
wound them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair
fell twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed up by it.

After a year or two, it came to pass that the king’s son rode through
the forest and passed by the tower. Then he heard a song, which was so
charming that he stood still and listened. This was Rapunzel, who in her
solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound. The king’s
son wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower,
but none was to be found. He rode home, but the singing had so deeply
touched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and
listened to it. Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw
that an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried:

‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
Let down your hair to me.’

Then Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress
climbed up to her. ‘If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I too
will try my fortune,’ said he, and the next day when it began to grow
dark, he went to the tower and cried:

‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
Let down your hair to me.’

Immediately the hair fell down and the king’s son climbed up.

At first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as her eyes
had never yet beheld, came to her; but the king’s son began to talk to
her quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred
that it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her.
Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take
him for her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she
thought: ‘He will love me more than old Dame Gothel does’; and she said
yes, and laid her hand in his. She said: ‘I will willingly go away with
you, but I do not know how to get down. Bring with you a skein of silk
every time that you come, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when
that is ready I will descend, and you will take me on your horse.’ They
agreed that until that time he should come to her every evening, for the
old woman came by day. The enchantress remarked nothing of this, until
once Rapunzel said to her: ‘Tell me, Dame Gothel, how it happens that
you are so much heavier for me to draw up than the young king’s son--he
is with me in a moment.’ ‘Ah! you wicked child,’ cried the enchantress.
‘What do I hear you say! I thought I had separated you from all
the world, and yet you have deceived me!’ In her anger she clutched
Rapunzel’s beautiful tresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand,
seized a pair of scissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut
off, and the lovely braids lay on the ground. And she was so pitiless
that she took poor Rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great
grief and misery.

On the same day that she cast out Rapunzel, however, the enchantress
fastened the braids of hair, which she had cut off, to the hook of the
window, and when the king’s son came and cried:

‘Rapunzel, Rapunzel,
Let down your hair to me.’

she let the hair down. The king’s son ascended, but instead of finding
his dearest Rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed at him with
wicked and venomous looks. ‘Aha!’ she cried mockingly, ‘you would fetch
your dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest;
the cat has got it, and will scratch out your eyes as well. Rapunzel is
lost to you; you will never see her again.’ The king’s son was beside
himself with pain, and in his despair he leapt down from the tower. He
escaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell pierced his
eyes. Then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but
roots and berries, and did naught but lament and weep over the loss of
his dearest wife. Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at
length came to the desert where Rapunzel, with the twins to which she
had given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness. He heard a
voice, and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it, and
when he approached, Rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept. Two
of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could
see with them as before. He led her to his kingdom where he was
joyfully received, and they lived for a long time afterwards, happy and
contented.




FUNDEVOGEL

There was once a forester who went into the forest to hunt, and as
he entered it he heard a sound of screaming as if a little child were
there. He followed the sound, and at last came to a high tree, and at
the top of this a little child was sitting, for the mother had fallen
asleep under the tree with the child, and a bird of prey had seen it in
her arms, had flown down, snatched it away, and set it on the high tree.

The forester climbed up, brought the child down, and thought to himself:
‘You will take him home with you, and bring him up with your Lina.’ He
took it home, therefore, and the two children grew up together. And the
one, which he had found on a tree was called Fundevogel, because a bird
had carried it away. Fundevogel and Lina loved each other so dearly that
when they did not see each other they were sad.

Now the forester had an old cook, who one evening took two pails and
began to fetch water, and did not go once only, but many times, out
to the spring. Lina saw this and said, ‘Listen, old Sanna, why are you
fetching so much water?’ ‘If you will never repeat it to anyone, I will
tell you why.’ So Lina said, no, she would never repeat it to anyone,
and then the cook said: ‘Early tomorrow morning, when the forester
is out hunting, I will heat the water, and when it is boiling in the
kettle, I will throw in Fundevogel, and will boil him in it.’

Early next morning the forester got up and went out hunting, and when he
was gone the children were still in bed. Then Lina said to Fundevogel:
‘If you will never leave me, I too will never leave you.’ Fundevogel
said: ‘Neither now, nor ever will I leave you.’ Then said Lina: ‘Then
will I tell you. Last night, old Sanna carried so many buckets of water
into the house that I asked her why she was doing that, and she said
that if I would promise not to tell anyone, and she said that early
tomorrow morning when father was out hunting, she would set the kettle
full of water, throw you into it and boil you; but we will get up
quickly, dress ourselves, and go away together.’

The two children therefore got up, dressed themselves quickly, and went
away. When the water in the kettle was boiling, the cook went into the
bedroom to fetch Fundevogel and throw him into it. But when she came in,
and went to the beds, both the children were gone. Then she was terribly
alarmed, and she said to herself: ‘What shall I say now when the
forester comes home and sees that the children are gone? They must be
followed instantly to get them back again.’

Then the cook sent three servants after them, who were to run and
overtake the children. The children, however, were sitting outside the
forest, and when they saw from afar the three servants running, Lina
said to Fundevogel: ‘Never leave me, and I will never leave you.’
Fundevogel said: ‘Neither now, nor ever.’ Then said Lina: ‘Do you become
a rose-tree, and I the rose upon it.’ When the three servants came to
the forest, nothing was there but a rose-tree and one rose on it, but
the children were nowhere. Then said they: ‘There is nothing to be done
here,’ and they went home and told the cook that they had seen nothing
in the forest but a little rose-bush with one rose on it. Then the
old cook scolded and said: ‘You simpletons, you should have cut the
rose-bush in two, and have broken off the rose and brought it home with
you; go, and do it at once.’ They had therefore to go out and look for
the second time. The children, however, saw them coming from a distance.
Then Lina said: ‘Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will never leave
you.’ Fundevogel said: ‘Neither now; nor ever.’ Said Lina: ‘Then do you
become a church, and I’ll be the chandelier in it.’ So when the three
servants came, nothing was there but a church, with a chandelier in
it. They said therefore to each other: ‘What can we do here, let us go
home.’ When they got home, the cook asked if they had not found them;
so they said no, they had found nothing but a church, and there was a
chandelier in it. And the cook scolded them and said: ‘You fools! why
did you not pull the church to pieces, and bring the chandelier home
with you?’ And now the old cook herself got on her legs, and went with
the three servants in pursuit of the children. The children, however,
saw from afar that the three servants were coming, and the cook waddling
after them. Then said Lina: ‘Fundevogel, never leave me, and I will
never leave you.’ Then said Fundevogel: ‘Neither now, nor ever.’
Said Lina: ‘Be a fishpond, and I will be the duck upon it.’ The cook,
however, came up to them, and when she saw the pond she lay down by it,
and was about to drink it up. But the duck swam quickly to her, seized
her head in its beak and drew her into the water, and there the old
witch had to drown. Then the children went home together, and were
heartily delighted, and if they have not died, they are living still.




THE VALIANT LITTLE TAILOR

One summer’s morning a little tailor was sitting on his table by the
window; he was in good spirits, and sewed with all his might. Then came
a peasant woman down the street crying: ‘Good jams, cheap! Good jams,
cheap!’ This rang pleasantly in the tailor’s ears; he stretched his
delicate head out of the window, and called: ‘Come up here, dear woman;
here you will get rid of your goods.’ The woman came up the three steps
to the tailor with her heavy basket, and he made her unpack all the pots
for him. He inspected each one, lifted it up, put his nose to it, and
at length said: ‘The jam seems to me to be good, so weigh me out four
ounces, dear woman, and if it is a quarter of a pound that is of no
consequence.’ The woman who had hoped to find a good sale, gave him
what he desired, but went away quite angry and grumbling. ‘Now, this jam
shall be blessed by God,’ cried the little tailor, ‘and give me health
and strength’; so he brought the bread out of the cupboard, cut himself
a piece right across the loaf and spread the jam over it. ‘This won’t
taste bitter,’ said he, ‘but I will just finish the jacket before I
take a bite.’ He laid the bread near him, sewed on, and in his joy, made
bigger and bigger stitches. In the meantime the smell of the sweet jam
rose to where the flies were sitting in great numbers, and they were
attracted and descended on it in hosts. ‘Hi! who invited you?’ said the
little tailor, and drove the unbidden guests away. The flies, however,
who understood no German, would not be turned away, but came back
again in ever-increasing companies. The little tailor at last lost all
patience, and drew a piece of cloth from the hole under his work-table,
and saying: ‘Wait, and I will give it to you,’ struck it mercilessly on
them. When he drew it away and counted, there lay before him no fewer
than seven, dead and with legs stretched out. ‘Are you a fellow of that
sort?’ said he, and could not help admiring his own bravery. ‘The whole
town shall know of this!’ And the little tailor hastened to cut himself
a girdle, stitched it, and embroidered on it in large letters: ‘Seven at
one stroke!’ ‘What, the town!’ he continued, ‘the whole world shall hear
of it!’ and his heart wagged with joy like a lamb’s tail. The tailor
put on the girdle, and resolved to go forth into the world, because he
thought his workshop was too small for his valour. Before he went away,
he sought about in the house to see if there was anything which he could
take with him; however, he found nothing but an old cheese, and that
he put in his pocket. In front of the door he observed a bird which
had caught itself in the thicket. It had to go into his pocket with the
cheese. Now he took to the road boldly, and as he was light and nimble,
he felt no fatigue. The road led him up a mountain, and when he had
reached the highest point of it, there sat a powerful giant looking
peacefully about him. The little tailor went bravely up, spoke to him,
and said: ‘Good day, comrade, so you are sitting there overlooking the
wide-spread world! I am just on my way thither, and want to try my luck.
Have you any inclination to go with me?’ The giant looked contemptuously
at the tailor, and said: ‘You ragamuffin! You miserable creature!’

‘Oh, indeed?’ answered the little tailor, and unbuttoned his coat, and
showed the giant the girdle, ‘there may you read what kind of a man I
am!’ The giant read: ‘Seven at one stroke,’ and thought that they had
been men whom the tailor had killed, and began to feel a little respect
for the tiny fellow. Nevertheless, he wished to try him first, and took
a stone in his hand and squeezed it together so that water dropped out
of it. ‘Do that likewise,’ said the giant, ‘if you have strength.’ ‘Is
that all?’ said the tailor, ‘that is child’s play with us!’ and put his
hand into his pocket, brought out the soft cheese, and pressed it until
the liquid ran out of it. ‘Faith,’ said he, ‘that was a little better,
wasn’t it?’ The giant did not know what to say, and could not believe it
of the little man. Then the giant picked up a stone and threw it so high
that the eye could scarcely follow it. ‘Now, little mite of a man, do
that likewise,’ ‘Well thrown,’ said the tailor, ‘but after all the stone
came down to earth again; I will throw you one which shall never come
back at all,’ and he put his hand into his pocket, took out the bird,
and threw it into the air. The bird, delighted with its liberty,
rose, flew away and did not come back. ‘How does that shot please you,
comrade?’ asked the tailor. ‘You can certainly throw,’ said the giant,
‘but now we will see if you are able to carry anything properly.’ He
took the little tailor to a mighty oak tree which lay there felled on
the ground, and said: ‘If you are strong enough, help me to carry the
tree out of the forest.’ ‘Readily,’ answered the little man; ‘take you
the trunk on your shoulders, and I will raise up the branches and twigs;
after all, they are the heaviest.’ The giant took the trunk on his
shoulder, but the tailor seated himself on a branch, and the giant, who
could not look round, had to carry away the whole tree, and the little
tailor into the bargain: he behind, was quite merry and happy, and
whistled the song: ‘Three tailors rode forth from the gate,’ as if
carrying the tree were child’s play. The giant, after he had dragged the
heavy burden part of the way, could go no further, and cried: ‘Hark
you, I shall have to let the tree fall!’ The tailor sprang nimbly down,
seized the tree with both arms as if he had been carrying it, and said
to the giant: ‘You are such a great fellow, and yet cannot even carry
the tree!’

They went on together, and as they passed a cherry-tree, the giant laid
hold of the top of the tree where the ripest fruit was hanging, bent it
down, gave it into the tailor’s hand, and bade him eat. But the little
tailor was much too weak to hold the tree, and when the giant let it go,
it sprang back again, and the tailor was tossed into the air with it.
When he had fallen down again without injury, the giant said: ‘What is
this? Have you not strength enough to hold the weak twig?’ ‘There is no
lack of strength,’ answered the little tailor. ‘Do you think that could
be anything to a man who has struck down seven at one blow? I leapt over
the tree because the huntsmen are shooting down there in the thicket.
Jump as I did, if you can do it.’ The giant made the attempt but he
could not get over the tree, and remained hanging in the branches, so
that in this also the tailor kept the upper hand.

The giant said: ‘If you are such a valiant fellow, come with me into our
cavern and spend the night with us.’ The little tailor was willing, and
followed him. When they went into the cave, other giants were sitting
there by the fire, and each of them had a roasted sheep in his hand and
was eating it. The little tailor looked round and thought: ‘It is much
more spacious here than in my workshop.’ The giant showed him a bed, and
said he was to lie down in it and sleep. The bed, however, was too
big for the little tailor; he did not lie down in it, but crept into
a corner. When it was midnight, and the giant thought that the little
tailor was lying in a sound sleep, he got up, took a great iron bar,
cut through the bed with one blow, and thought he had finished off the
grasshopper for good. With the earliest dawn the giants went into the
forest, and had quite forgotten the little tailor, when all at once he
walked up to them quite merrily and boldly. The giants were terrified,
they were afraid that he would strike them all dead, and ran away in a
great hurry.

The little tailor went onwards, always following his own pointed nose.
After he had walked for a long time, he came to the courtyard of a royal
palace, and as he felt weary, he lay down on the grass and fell asleep.
Whilst he lay there, the people came and inspected him on all sides, and
read on his girdle: ‘Seven at one stroke.’ ‘Ah!’ said they, ‘what does
the great warrior want here in the midst of peace? He must be a mighty
lord.’ They went and announced him to the king, and gave it as their
opinion that if war should break out, this would be a weighty and useful
man who ought on no account to be allowed to depart. The counsel pleased
the king, and he sent one of his courtiers to the little tailor to offer
him military service when he awoke. The ambassador remained standing by
the sleeper, waited until he stretched his limbs and opened his eyes,
and then conveyed to him this proposal. ‘For this very reason have
I come here,’ the tailor replied, ‘I am ready to enter the king’s
service.’ He was therefore honourably received, and a special dwelling
was assigned him.

The soldiers, however, were set against the little tailor, and wished
him a thousand miles away. ‘What is to be the end of this?’ they said
among themselves. ‘If we quarrel with him, and he strikes about him,
seven of us will fall at every blow; not one of us can stand against
him.’ They came therefore to a decision, betook themselves in a body to
the king, and begged for their dismissal. ‘We are not prepared,’ said
they, ‘to stay with a man who kills seven at one stroke.’ The king was
sorry that for the sake of one he should lose all his faithful servants,
wished that he had never set eyes on the tailor, and would willingly
have been rid of him again. But he did not venture to give him his
dismissal, for he dreaded lest he should strike him and all his people
dead, and place himself on the royal throne. He thought about it for a
long time, and at last found good counsel. He sent to the little tailor
and caused him to be informed that as he was a great warrior, he had one
request to make to him. In a forest of his country lived two giants,
who caused great mischief with their robbing, murdering, ravaging,
and burning, and no one could approach them without putting himself in
danger of death. If the tailor conquered and killed these two giants, he
would give him his only daughter to wife, and half of his kingdom as a
dowry, likewise one hundred horsemen should go with him to assist him.
‘That would indeed be a fine thing for a man like me!’ thought the
little tailor. ‘One is not offered a beautiful princess and half a
kingdom every day of one’s life!’ ‘Oh, yes,’ he replied, ‘I will soon
subdue the giants, and do not require the help of the hundred horsemen
to do it; he who can hit seven with one blow has no need to be afraid of
two.’

The little tailor went forth, and the hundred horsemen followed him.
When he came to the outskirts of the forest, he said to his followers:
‘Just stay waiting here, I alone will soon finish off the giants.’ Then
he bounded into the forest and looked about right and left. After a
while he perceived both giants. They lay sleeping under a tree, and
snored so that the branches waved up and down. The little tailor, not
idle, gathered two pocketsful of stones, and with these climbed up the
tree. When he was halfway up, he slipped down by a branch, until he sat
just above the sleepers, and then let one stone after another fall on
the breast of one of the giants. For a long time the giant felt nothing,
but at last he awoke, pushed his comrade, and said: ‘Why are you
knocking me?’ ‘You must be dreaming,’ said the other, ‘I am not knocking
you.’ They laid themselves down to sleep again, and then the tailor
threw a stone down on the second. ‘What is the meaning of this?’ cried
the other ‘Why are you pelting me?’ ‘I am not pelting you,’ answered
the first, growling. They disputed about it for a time, but as they were
weary they let the matter rest, and their eyes closed once more. The
little tailor began his game again, picked out the biggest stone, and
threw it with all his might on the breast of the first giant. ‘That
is too bad!’ cried he, and sprang up like a madman, and pushed his
companion against the tree until it shook. The other paid him back in
the same coin, and they got into such a rage that they tore up trees and
belaboured each other so long, that at last they both fell down dead on
the ground at the same time. Then the little tailor leapt down. ‘It is
a lucky thing,’ said he, ‘that they did not tear up the tree on which
I was sitting, or I should have had to sprint on to another like a
squirrel; but we tailors are nimble.’ He drew out his sword and gave
each of them a couple of thrusts in the breast, and then went out to the
horsemen and said: ‘The work is done; I have finished both of them
off, but it was hard work! They tore up trees in their sore need, and
defended themselves with them, but all that is to no purpose when a man
like myself comes, who can kill seven at one blow.’ ‘But are you not
wounded?’ asked the horsemen. ‘You need not concern yourself about
that,’ answered the tailor, ‘they have not bent one hair of mine.’ The
horsemen would not believe him, and rode into the forest; there they
found the giants swimming in their blood, and all round about lay the
torn-up trees.

The little tailor demanded of the king the promised reward; he, however,
repented of his promise, and again bethought himself how he could get
rid of the hero. ‘Before you receive my daughter, and the half of my
kingdom,’ said he to him, ‘you must perform one more heroic deed. In
the forest roams a unicorn which does great harm, and you must catch
it first.’ ‘I fear one unicorn still less than two giants. Seven at one
blow, is my kind of affair.’ He took a rope and an axe with him, went
forth into the forest, and again bade those who were sent with him to
wait outside. He had not long to seek. The unicorn soon came towards
him, and rushed directly on the tailor, as if it would gore him with its
horn without more ado. ‘Softly, softly; it can’t be done as quickly as
that,’ said he, and stood still and waited until the animal was quite
close, and then sprang nimbly behind the tree. The unicorn ran against
the tree with all its strength, and stuck its horn so fast in the trunk
that it had not the strength enough to draw it out again, and thus it
was caught. ‘Now, I have got the bird,’ said the tailor, and came out
from behind the tree and put the rope round its neck, and then with his
axe he hewed the horn out of the tree, and when all was ready he led the
beast away and took it to the king.

The king still would not give him the promised reward, and made a third
demand. Before the wedding the tailor was to catch him a wild boar that
made great havoc in the forest, and the huntsmen should give him their
help. ‘Willingly,’ said the tailor, ‘that is child’s play!’ He did not
take the huntsmen with him into the forest, and they were well pleased
that he did not, for the wild boar had several times received them in
such a manner that they had no inclination to lie in wait for him. When
the boar perceived the tailor, it ran on him with foaming mouth and
whetted tusks, and was about to throw him to the ground, but the hero
fled and sprang into a chapel which was near and up to the window at
once, and in one bound out again. The boar ran after him, but the tailor
ran round outside and shut the door behind it, and then the raging
beast, which was much too heavy and awkward to leap out of the window,
was caught. The little tailor called the huntsmen thither that they
might see the prisoner with their own eyes. The hero, however, went to
the king, who was now, whether he liked it or not, obliged to keep his
promise, and gave his daughter and the half of his kingdom. Had he known
that it was no warlike hero, but a little tailor who was standing before
him, it would have gone to his heart still more than it did. The wedding
was held with great magnificence and small joy, and out of a tailor a
king was made.

After some time the young queen heard her husband say in his dreams at
night: ‘Boy, make me the doublet, and patch the pantaloons, or else I
will rap the yard-measure over your ears.’ Then she discovered in what
state of life the young lord had been born, and next morning complained
of her wrongs to her father, and begged him to help her to get rid of
her husband, who was nothing else but a tailor. The king comforted her
and said: ‘Leave your bedroom door open this night, and my servants
shall stand outside, and when he has fallen asleep shall go in, bind
him, and take him on board a ship which shall carry him into the wide
world.’ The woman was satisfied with this; but the king’s armour-bearer,
who had heard all, was friendly with the young lord, and informed him of
the whole plot. ‘I’ll put a screw into that business,’ said the little
tailor. At night he went to bed with his wife at the usual time, and
when she thought that he had fallen asleep, she got up, opened the door,
and then lay down again. The little tailor, who was only pretending to
be asleep, began to cry out in a clear voice: ‘Boy, make me the doublet
and patch me the pantaloons, or I will rap the yard-measure over your
ears. I smote seven at one blow. I killed two giants, I brought away one
unicorn, and caught a wild boar, and am I to fear those who are standing
outside the room.’ When these men heard the tailor speaking thus, they
were overcome by a great dread, and ran as if the wild huntsman were
behind them, and none of them would venture anything further against
him. So the little tailor was and remained a king to the end of his
life.




HANSEL AND GRETEL

Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter with his wife and his
two children. The boy was called Hansel and the girl Gretel. He had
little to bite and to break, and once when great dearth fell on the
land, he could no longer procure even daily bread. Now when he thought
over this by night in his bed, and tossed about in his anxiety, he
groaned and said to his wife: ‘What is to become of us? How are we
to feed our poor children, when we no longer have anything even for
ourselves?’ ‘I’ll tell you what, husband,’ answered the woman, ‘early
tomorrow morning we will take the children out into the forest to where
it is the thickest; there we will light a fire for them, and give each
of them one more piece of bread, and then we will go to our work and
leave them alone. They will not find the way home again, and we shall be
rid of them.’ ‘No, wife,’ said the man, ‘I will not do that; how can I
bear to leave my children alone in the forest?--the wild animals would
soon come and tear them to pieces.’ ‘O, you fool!’ said she, ‘then we
must all four die of hunger, you may as well plane the planks for our
coffins,’ and she left him no peace until he consented. ‘But I feel very
sorry for the poor children, all the same,’ said the man.

The two children had also not been able to sleep for hunger, and had
heard what their stepmother had said to their father. Gretel wept
bitter tears, and said to Hansel: ‘Now all is over with us.’ ‘Be quiet,
Gretel,’ said Hansel, ‘do not distress yourself, I will soon find a way
to help us.’ And when the old folks had fallen asleep, he got up, put
on his little coat, opened the door below, and crept outside. The moon
shone brightly, and the white pebbles which lay in front of the house
glittered like real silver pennies. Hansel stooped and stuffed the
little pocket of his coat with as many as he could get in. Then he went
back and said to Gretel: ‘Be comforted, dear little sister, and sleep in
peace, God will not forsake us,’ and he lay down again in his bed. When
day dawned, but before the sun had risen, the woman came and awoke the
two children, saying: ‘Get up, you sluggards! we are going into the
forest to fetch wood.’ She gave each a little piece of bread, and said:
‘There is something for your dinner, but do not eat it up before then,
for you will get nothing else.’ Gretel took the bread under her apron,
as Hansel had the pebbles in his pocket. Then they all set out together
on the way to the forest. When they had walked a short time, Hansel
stood still and peeped back at the house, and did so again and again.
His father said: ‘Hansel, what are you looking at there and staying
behind for? Pay attention, and do not forget how to use your legs.’ ‘Ah,
father,’ said Hansel, ‘I am looking at my little white cat, which is
sitting up on the roof, and wants to say goodbye to me.’ The wife said:
‘Fool, that is not your little cat, that is the morning sun which is
shining on the chimneys.’ Hansel, however, had not been looking back at
the cat, but had been constantly throwing one of the white pebble-stones
out of his pocket on the road.

When they had reached the middle of the forest, the father said: ‘Now,
children, pile up some wood, and I will light a fire that you may not
be cold.’ Hansel and Gretel gathered brushwood together, as high as a
little hill. The brushwood was lighted, and when the flames were burning
very high, the woman said: ‘Now, children, lay yourselves down by the
fire and rest, we will go into the forest and cut some wood. When we
have done, we will come back and fetch you away.’

Hansel and Gretel sat by the fire, and when noon came, each ate a little
piece of bread, and as they heard the strokes of the wood-axe they
believed that their father was near. It was not the axe, however, but
a branch which he had fastened to a withered tree which the wind was
blowing backwards and forwards. And as they had been sitting such a long
time, their eyes closed with fatigue, and they fell fast asleep. When
at last they awoke, it was already dark night. Gretel began to cry and
said: ‘How are we to get out of the forest now?’ But Hansel comforted
her and said: ‘Just wait a little, until the moon has risen, and then we
will soon find the way.’ And when the full moon had risen, Hansel took
his little sister by the hand, and followed the pebbles which shone like
newly-coined silver pieces, and showed them the way.

They walked the whole night long, and by break of day came once more
to their father’s house. They knocked at the door, and when the woman
opened it and saw that it was Hansel and Gretel, she said: ‘You naughty
children, why have you slept so long in the forest?--we thought you were
never coming back at all!’ The father, however, rejoiced, for it had cut
him to the heart to leave them behind alone.

Not long afterwards, there was once more great dearth throughout the
land, and the children heard their mother saying at night to their
father: ‘Everything is eaten again, we have one half loaf left, and that
is the end. The children must go, we will take them farther into the
wood, so that they will not find their way out again; there is no other
means of saving ourselves!’ The man’s heart was heavy, and he thought:
‘It would be better for you to share the last mouthful with your
children.’ The woman, however, would listen to nothing that he had to
say, but scolded and reproached him. He who says A must say B, likewise,
and as he had yielded the first time, he had to do so a second time
also.

The children, however, were still awake and had heard the conversation.
When the old folks were asleep, Hansel again got up, and wanted to go
out and pick up pebbles as he had done before, but the woman had locked
the door, and Hansel could not get out. Nevertheless he comforted his
little sister, and said: ‘Do not cry, Gretel, go to sleep quietly, the
good God will help us.’

Early in the morning came the woman, and took the children out of their
beds. Their piece of bread was given to them, but it was still smaller
than the time before. On the way into the forest Hansel crumbled his
in his pocket, and often stood still and threw a morsel on the ground.
‘Hansel, why do you stop and look round?’ said the father, ‘go on.’ ‘I
am looking back at my little pigeon which is sitting on the roof, and
wants to say goodbye to me,’ answered Hansel. ‘Fool!’ said the woman,
‘that is not your little pigeon, that is the morning sun that is shining
on the chimney.’ Hansel, however little by little, threw all the crumbs
on the path.

The woman led the children still deeper into the forest, where they had
never in their lives been before. Then a great fire was again made, and
the mother said: ‘Just sit there, you children, and when you are tired
you may sleep a little; we are going into the forest to cut wood, and in
the evening when we are done, we will come and fetch you away.’ When
it was noon, Gretel shared her piece of bread with Hansel, who had
scattered his by the way. Then they fell asleep and evening passed, but
no one came to the poor children. They did not awake until it was dark
night, and Hansel comforted his little sister and said: ‘Just wait,
Gretel, until the moon rises, and then we shall see the crumbs of bread
which I have strewn about, they will show us our way home again.’ When
the moon came they set out, but they found no crumbs, for the many
thousands of birds which fly about in the woods and fields had picked
them all up. Hansel said to Gretel: ‘We shall soon find the way,’ but
they did not find it. They walked the whole night and all the next day
too from morning till evening, but they did not get out of the forest,
and were very hungry, for they had nothing to eat but two or three
berries, which grew on the ground. And as they were so weary that their
legs would carry them no longer, they lay down beneath a tree and fell
asleep.

It was now three mornings since they had left their father’s house. They
began to walk again, but they always came deeper into the forest, and if
help did not come soon, they must die of hunger and weariness. When it
was mid-day, they saw a beautiful snow-white bird sitting on a bough,
which sang so delightfully that they stood still and listened to it. And
when its song was over, it spread its wings and flew away before them,
and they followed it until they reached a little house, on the roof of
which it alighted; and when they approached the little house they saw
that it was built of bread and covered with cakes, but that the windows
were of clear sugar. ‘We will set to work on that,’ said Hansel, ‘and
have a good meal. I will eat a bit of the roof, and you Gretel, can eat
some of the window, it will taste sweet.’ Hansel reached up above, and
broke off a little of the roof to try how it tasted, and Gretel leant
against the window and nibbled at the panes. Then a soft voice cried
from the parlour:

‘Nibble, nibble, gnaw,
Who is nibbling at my little house?’

The children answered:

‘The wind, the wind,
The heaven-born wind,’

and went on eating without disturbing themselves. Hansel, who liked the
taste of the roof, tore down a great piece of it, and Gretel pushed out
the whole of one round window-pane, sat down, and enjoyed herself with
it. Suddenly the door opened, and a woman as old as the hills, who
supported herself on crutches, came creeping out. Hansel and Gretel were
so terribly frightened that they let fall what they had in their
hands. The old woman, however, nodded her head, and said: ‘Oh, you dear
children, who has brought you here? do come in, and stay with me. No
harm shall happen to you.’ She took them both by the hand, and led them
into her little house. Then good food was set before them, milk and
pancakes, with sugar, apples, and nuts. Afterwards two pretty little
beds were covered with clean white linen, and Hansel and Gretel lay down
in them, and thought they were in heaven.

The old woman had only pretended to be so kind; she was in reality
a wicked witch, who lay in wait for children, and had only built the
little house of bread in order to entice them there. When a child fell
into her power, she killed it, cooked and ate it, and that was a feast
day with her. Witches have red eyes, and cannot see far, but they have
a keen scent like the beasts, and are aware when human beings draw near.
When Hansel and Gretel came into her neighbourhood, she laughed with
malice, and said mockingly: ‘I have them, they shall not escape me
again!’ Early in the morning before the children were awake, she was
already up, and when she saw both of them sleeping and looking so
pretty, with their plump and rosy cheeks she muttered to herself: ‘That
will be a dainty mouthful!’ Then she seized Hansel with her shrivelled
hand, carried him into a little stable, and locked him in behind a
grated door. Scream as he might, it would not help him. Then she went to
Gretel, shook her till she awoke, and cried: ‘Get up, lazy thing, fetch
some water, and cook something good for your brother, he is in the
stable outside, and is to be made fat. When he is fat, I will eat him.’
Gretel began to weep bitterly, but it was all in vain, for she was
forced to do what the wicked witch commanded.

And now the best food was cooked for poor Hansel, but Gretel got nothing
but crab-shells. Every morning the woman crept to the little stable, and
cried: ‘Hansel, stretch out your finger that I may feel if you will soon
be fat.’ Hansel, however, stretched out a little bone to her, and
the old woman, who had dim eyes, could not see it, and thought it was
Hansel’s finger, and was astonished that there was no way of fattening
him. When four weeks had gone by, and Hansel still remained thin, she
was seized with impatience and would not wait any longer. ‘Now, then,
Gretel,’ she cried to the girl, ‘stir yourself, and bring some water.
Let Hansel be fat or lean, tomorrow I will kill him, and cook him.’ Ah,
how the poor little sister did lament when she had to fetch the water,
and how her tears did flow down her cheeks! ‘Dear God, do help us,’ she
cried. ‘If the wild beasts in the forest had but devoured us, we should
at any rate have died together.’ ‘Just keep your noise to yourself,’
said the old woman, ‘it won’t help you at all.’

Early in the morning, Gretel had to go out and hang up the cauldron with
the water, and light the fire. ‘We will bake first,’ said the old woman,
‘I have already heated the oven, and kneaded the dough.’ She pushed poor
Gretel out to the oven, from which flames of fire were already darting.
‘Creep in,’ said the witch, ‘and see if it is properly heated, so that
we can put the bread in.’ And once Gretel was inside, she intended to
shut the oven and let her bake in it, and then she would eat her, too.
But Gretel saw what she had in mind, and said: ‘I do not know how I am
to do it; how do I get in?’ ‘Silly goose,’ said the old woman. ‘The door
is big enough; just look, I can get in myself!’ and she crept up and
thrust her head into the oven. Then Gretel gave her a push that drove
her far into it, and shut the iron door, and fastened the bolt. Oh! then
she began to howl quite horribly, but Gretel ran away and the godless
witch was miserably burnt to death.

Gretel, however, ran like lightning to Hansel, opened his little stable,
and cried: ‘Hansel, we are saved! The old witch is dead!’ Then Hansel
sprang like a bird from its cage when the door is opened. How they did
rejoice and embrace each other, and dance about and kiss each other! And
as they had no longer any need to fear her, they went into the witch’s
house, and in every corner there stood chests full of pearls and jewels.
‘These are far better than pebbles!’ said Hansel, and thrust into his
pockets whatever could be got in, and Gretel said: ‘I, too, will take
something home with me,’ and filled her pinafore full. ‘But now we must
be off,’ said Hansel, ‘that we may get out of the witch’s forest.’

When they had walked for two hours, they came to a great stretch of
water. ‘We cannot cross,’ said Hansel, ‘I see no foot-plank, and no
bridge.’ ‘And there is also no ferry,’ answered Gretel, ‘but a white
duck is swimming there: if I ask her, she will help us over.’ Then she
cried:

‘Little duck, little duck, dost thou see,
Hansel and Gretel are waiting for thee?
There’s never a plank, or bridge in sight,
Take us across on thy back so white.’

The duck came to them, and Hansel seated himself on its back, and told
his sister to sit by him. ‘No,’ replied Gretel, ‘that will be too heavy
for the little duck; she shall take us across, one after the other.’ The
good little duck did so, and when they were once safely across and had
walked for a short time, the forest seemed to be more and more familiar
to them, and at length they saw from afar their father’s house. Then
they began to run, rushed into the parlour, and threw themselves round
their father’s neck. The man had not known one happy hour since he had
left the children in the forest; the woman, however, was dead. Gretel
emptied her pinafore until pearls and precious stones ran about the
room, and Hansel threw one handful after another out of his pocket to
add to them. Then all anxiety was at an end, and they lived together
in perfect happiness. My tale is done, there runs a mouse; whosoever
catches it, may make himself a big fur cap out of it.




THE MOUSE, THE BIRD, AND THE SAUSAGE

Once upon a time, a mouse, a bird, and a sausage, entered into
partnership and set up house together. For a long time all went well;
they lived in great comfort, and prospered so far as to be able to add
considerably to their stores. The bird’s duty was to fly daily into the
wood and bring in fuel; the mouse fetched the water, and the sausage saw
to the cooking.

When people are too well off they always begin to long for something
new. And so it came to pass, that the bird, while out one day, met a
fellow bird, to whom he boastfully expatiated on the excellence of his
household arrangements. But the other bird sneered at him for being a
poor simpleton, who did all the hard work, while the other two stayed
at home and had a good time of it. For, when the mouse had made the fire
and fetched in the water, she could retire into her little room and rest
until it was time to set the table. The sausage had only to watch the
pot to see that the food was properly cooked, and when it was near
dinner-time, he just threw himself into the broth, or rolled in and out
among the vegetables three or four times, and there they were, buttered,
and salted, and ready to be served. Then, when the bird came home and
had laid aside his burden, they sat down to table, and when they had
finished their meal, they could sleep their fill till the following
morning: and that was really a very delightful life.

Influenced by those remarks, the bird next morning refused to bring in
the wood, telling the others that he had been their servant long enough,
and had been a fool into the bargain, and that it was now time to make a
change, and to try some other way of arranging the work. Beg and pray
as the mouse and the sausage might, it was of no use; the bird remained
master of the situation, and the venture had to be made. They therefore
drew lots, and it fell to the sausage to bring in the wood, to the mouse
to cook, and to the bird to fetch the water.

And now what happened? The sausage started in search of wood, the bird
made the fire, and the mouse put on the pot, and then these two waited
till the sausage returned with the fuel for the following day. But the
sausage remained so long away, that they became uneasy, and the bird
flew out to meet him. He had not flown far, however, when he came across
a dog who, having met the sausage, had regarded him as his legitimate
booty, and so seized and swallowed him. The bird complained to the dog
of this bare-faced robbery, but nothing he said was of any avail, for
the dog answered that he found false credentials on the sausage, and
that was the reason his life had been forfeited.

He picked up the wood, and flew sadly home, and told the mouse all he
had seen and heard. They were both very unhappy, but agreed to make the
best of things and to remain with one another.

So now the bird set the table, and the mouse looked after the food and,
wishing to prepare it in the same way as the sausage, by rolling in and
out among the vegetables to salt and butter them, she jumped into the
pot; but she stopped short long before she reached the bottom, having
already parted not only with her skin and hair, but also with life.

Presently the bird came in and wanted to serve up the dinner, but he
could nowhere see the cook. In his alarm and flurry, he threw the wood
here and there about the floor, called and searched, but no cook was to
be found. Then some of the wood that had been carelessly thrown down,
caught fire and began to blaze. The bird hastened to fetch some water,
but his pail fell into the well, and he after it, and as he was unable
to recover himself, he was drowned.




MOTHER HOLLE

Once upon a time there was a widow who had two daughters; one of them
was beautiful and industrious, the other ugly and lazy. The mother,
however, loved the ugly and lazy one best, because she was her own
daughter, and so the other, who was only her stepdaughter, was made
to do all the work of the house, and was quite the Cinderella of the
family. Her stepmother sent her out every day to sit by the well in
the high road, there to spin until she made her fingers bleed. Now it
chanced one day that some blood fell on to the spindle, and as the girl
stopped over the well to wash it off, the spindle suddenly sprang out
of her hand and fell into the well. She ran home crying to tell of her
misfortune, but her stepmother spoke harshly to her, and after giving
her a violent scolding, said unkindly, ‘As you have let the spindle fall
into the well you may go yourself and fetch it out.’

The girl went back to the well not knowing what to do, and at last in
her distress she jumped into the water after the spindle.

She remembered nothing more until she awoke and found herself in a
beautiful meadow, full of sunshine, and with countless flowers blooming
in every direction.

She walked over the meadow, and presently she came upon a baker’s oven
full of bread, and the loaves cried out to her, ‘Take us out, take us
out, or alas! we shall be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long
ago.’ So she took the bread-shovel and drew them all out.

She went on a little farther, till she came to a tree full of apples.
‘Shake me, shake me, I pray,’ cried the tree; ‘my apples, one and all,
are ripe.’ So she shook the tree, and the apples came falling down upon
her like rain; but she continued shaking until there was not a single
apple left upon it. Then she carefully gathered the apples together in a
heap and walked on again.

The next thing she came to was a little house, and there she saw an old
woman looking out, with such large teeth, that she was terrified, and
turned to run away. But the old woman called after her, ‘What are you
afraid of, dear child? Stay with me; if you will do the work of my house
properly for me, I will make you very happy. You must be very careful,
however, to make my bed in the right way, for I wish you always to shake
it thoroughly, so that the feathers fly about; then they say, down there
in the world, that it is snowing; for I am Mother Holle.’ The old woman
spoke so kindly, that the girl summoned up courage and agreed to enter
into her service.

She took care to do everything according to the old woman’s bidding and
every time she made the bed she shook it with all her might, so that the
feathers flew about like so many snowflakes. The old woman was as good
as her word: she never spoke angrily to her, and gave her roast and
boiled meats every day.

So she stayed on with Mother Holle for some time, and then she began
to grow unhappy. She could not at first tell why she felt sad, but she
became conscious at last of great longing to go home; then she knew she
was homesick, although she was a thousand times better off with Mother
Holle than with her mother and sister. After waiting awhile, she went
to Mother Holle and said, ‘I am so homesick, that I cannot stay with
you any longer, for although I am so happy here, I must return to my own
people.’

Then Mother Holle said, ‘I am pleased that you should want to go back
to your own people, and as you have served me so well and faithfully, I
will take you home myself.’

Thereupon she led the girl by the hand up to a broad gateway. The gate
was opened, and as the girl passed through, a shower of gold fell upon
her, and the gold clung to her, so that she was covered with it from
head to foot.

‘That is a reward for your industry,’ said Mother Holle, and as she
spoke she handed her the spindle which she had dropped into the well.

The gate was then closed, and the girl found herself back in the old
world close to her mother’s house. As she entered the courtyard, the
cock who was perched on the well, called out:

‘Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Your golden daughter’s come back to you.’

Then she went in to her mother and sister, and as she was so richly
covered with gold, they gave her a warm welcome. She related to them
all that had happened, and when the mother heard how she had come by her
great riches, she thought she should like her ugly, lazy daughter to go
and try her fortune. So she made the sister go and sit by the well
and spin, and the girl pricked her finger and thrust her hand into a
thorn-bush, so that she might drop some blood on to the spindle; then
she threw it into the well, and jumped in herself.

Like her sister she awoke in the beautiful meadow, and walked over it
till she came to the oven. ‘Take us out, take us out, or alas! we shall
be burnt to a cinder; we were baked through long ago,’ cried the loaves
as before. But the lazy girl answered, ‘Do you think I am going to dirty
my hands for you?’ and walked on.

Presently she came to the apple-tree. ‘Shake me, shake me, I pray; my
apples, one and all, are ripe,’ it cried. But she only answered, ‘A nice
thing to ask me to do, one of the apples might fall on my head,’ and
passed on.

At last she came to Mother Holle’s house, and as she had heard all about
the large teeth from her sister, she was not afraid of them, and engaged
herself without delay to the old woman.

The first day she was very obedient and industrious, and exerted herself
to please Mother Holle, for she thought of the gold she should get in
return. The next day, however, she began to dawdle over her work, and
the third day she was more idle still; then she began to lie in bed in
the mornings and refused to get up. Worse still, she neglected to
make the old woman’s bed properly, and forgot to shake it so that the
feathers might fly about. So Mother Holle very soon got tired of her,
and told her she might go. The lazy girl was delighted at this, and
thought to herself, ‘The gold will soon be mine.’ Mother Holle led her,
as she had led her sister, to the broad gateway; but as she was passing
through, instead of the shower of gold, a great bucketful of pitch came
pouring over her.

‘That is in return for your services,’ said the old woman, and she shut
the gate.

So the lazy girl had to go home covered with pitch, and the cock on the
well called out as she saw her:

‘Cock-a-doodle-doo!
Your dirty daughter’s come back to you.’

But, try what she would, she could not get the pitch off and it stuck to
her as long as she lived.




LITTLE RED-CAP [LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD]

Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by everyone
who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there was
nothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a
little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never
wear anything else; so she was always called ‘Little Red-Cap.’

One day her mother said to her: ‘Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece
of cake and a bottle of wine; take them to your grandmother, she is ill
and weak, and they will do her good. Set out before it gets hot, and
when you are going, walk nicely and quietly and do not run off the path,
or you may fall and break the bottle, and then your grandmother will
get nothing; and when you go into her room, don’t forget to say, “Good
morning”, and don’t peep into every corner before you do it.’

‘I will take great care,’ said Little Red-Cap to her mother, and gave
her hand on it.

The grandmother lived out in the wood, half a league from the village,
and just as Little Red-Cap entered the wood, a wolf met her. Red-Cap
did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of
him.

‘Good day, Little Red-Cap,’ said he.

‘Thank you kindly, wolf.’

‘Whither away so early, Little Red-Cap?’

‘To my grandmother’s.’

‘What have you got in your apron?’

‘Cake and wine; yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick grandmother is to
have something good, to make her stronger.’

‘Where does your grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?’

‘A good quarter of a league farther on in the wood; her house stands
under the three large oak-trees, the nut-trees are just below; you
surely must know it,’ replied Little Red-Cap.

The wolf thought to himself: ‘What a tender young creature! what a nice
plump mouthful--she will be better to eat than the old woman. I must
act craftily, so as to catch both.’ So he walked for a short time by
the side of Little Red-Cap, and then he said: ‘See, Little Red-Cap, how
pretty the flowers are about here--why do you not look round? I believe,
too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing; you
walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else
out here in the wood is merry.’

Little Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing
here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere,
she thought: ‘Suppose I take grandmother a fresh nosegay; that would
please her too. It is so early in the day that I shall still get there
in good time’; and so she ran from the path into the wood to look for
flowers. And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a
still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and so got deeper and
deeper into the wood.

Meanwhile the wolf ran straight to the grandmother’s house and knocked
at the door.

‘Who is there?’

‘Little Red-Cap,’ replied the wolf. ‘She is bringing cake and wine; open
the door.’

‘Lift the latch,’ called out the grandmother, ‘I am too weak, and cannot
get up.’

The wolf lifted the latch, the door sprang open, and without saying a
word he went straight to the grandmother’s bed, and devoured her. Then
he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap laid himself in bed
and drew the curtains.

Little Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers,
and when she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she
remembered her grandmother, and set out on the way to her.

She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open, and when she
went into the room, she had such a strange feeling that she said to
herself: ‘Oh dear! how uneasy I feel today, and at other times I like
being with grandmother so much.’ She called out: ‘Good morning,’ but
received no answer; so she went to the bed and drew back the curtains.
There lay her grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and
looking very strange.

‘Oh! grandmother,’ she said, ‘what big ears you have!’

‘The better to hear you with, my child,’ was the reply.

‘But, grandmother, what big eyes you have!’ she said.

‘The better to see you with, my dear.’

‘But, grandmother, what large hands you have!’

‘The better to hug you with.’

‘Oh! but, grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!’

‘The better to eat you with!’

And scarcely had the wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of
bed and swallowed up Red-Cap.

When the wolf had appeased his appetite, he lay down again in the bed,
fell asleep and began to snore very loud. The huntsman was just passing
the house, and thought to himself: ‘How the old woman is snoring! I must
just see if she wants anything.’ So he went into the room, and when he
came to the bed, he saw that the wolf was lying in it. ‘Do I find you
here, you old sinner!’ said he. ‘I have long sought you!’ Then just as
he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the wolf might have
devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved, so he did
not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach
of the sleeping wolf. When he had made two snips, he saw the little
Red-Cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl
sprang out, crying: ‘Ah, how frightened I have been! How dark it was
inside the wolf’; and after that the aged grandmother came out alive
also, but scarcely able to breathe. Red-Cap, however, quickly fetched
great stones with which they filled the wolf’s belly, and when he awoke,
he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he collapsed at
once, and fell dead.

Then all three were delighted. The huntsman drew off the wolf’s skin and
went home with it; the grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which
Red-Cap had brought, and revived, but Red-Cap thought to herself: ‘As
long as I live, I will never by myself leave the path, to run into the
wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.’




It also related that once when Red-Cap was again taking cakes to the old
grandmother, another wolf spoke to her, and tried to entice her from the
path. Red-Cap, however, was on her guard, and went straight forward on
her way, and told her grandmother that she had met the wolf, and that he
had said ‘good morning’ to her, but with such a wicked look in his eyes,
that if they had not been on the public road she was certain he would
have eaten her up. ‘Well,’ said the grandmother, ‘we will shut the door,
that he may not come in.’ Soon afterwards the wolf knocked, and cried:
‘Open the door, grandmother, I am Little Red-Cap, and am bringing you
some cakes.’ But they did not speak, or open the door, so the grey-beard
stole twice or thrice round the house, and at last jumped on the roof,
intending to wait until Red-Cap went home in the evening, and then to
steal after her and devour her in the darkness. But the grandmother
saw what was in his thoughts. In front of the house was a great stone
trough, so she said to the child: ‘Take the pail, Red-Cap; I made some
sausages yesterday, so carry the water in which I boiled them to the
trough.’ Red-Cap carried until the great trough was quite full. Then the
smell of the sausages reached the wolf, and he sniffed and peeped down,
and at last stretched out his neck so far that he could no longer keep
his footing and began to slip, and slipped down from the roof straight
into the great trough, and was drowned. But Red-Cap went joyously home,
and no one ever did anything to harm her again.




THE ROBBER BRIDEGROOM

There was once a miller who had one beautiful daughter, and as she was
grown up, he was anxious that she should be well married and provided
for. He said to himself, ‘I will give her to the first suitable man who
comes and asks for her hand.’ Not long after a suitor appeared, and as
he appeared to be very rich and the miller could see nothing in him with
which to find fault, he betrothed his daughter to him. But the girl did
not care for the man as a girl ought to care for her betrothed husband.
She did not feel that she could trust him, and she could not look at him
nor think of him without an inward shudder. One day he said to her, ‘You
have not yet paid me a visit, although we have been betrothed for some
time.’ ‘I do not know where your house is,’ she answered. ‘My house is
out there in the dark forest,’ he said. She tried to excuse herself by
saying that she would not be able to find the way thither. Her betrothed
only replied, ‘You must come and see me next Sunday; I have already
invited guests for that day, and that you may not mistake the way, I
will strew ashes along the path.’

When Sunday came, and it was time for the girl to start, a feeling of
dread came over her which she could not explain, and that she might
be able to find her path again, she filled her pockets with peas and
lentils to sprinkle on the ground as she went along. On reaching the
entrance to the forest she found the path strewed with ashes, and these
she followed, throwing down some peas on either side of her at every
step she took. She walked the whole day until she came to the deepest,
darkest part of the forest. There she saw a lonely house, looking so
grim and mysterious, that it did not please her at all. She stepped
inside, but not a soul was to be seen, and a great silence reigned
throughout. Suddenly a voice cried:

‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,
Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’

The girl looked up and saw that the voice came from a bird hanging in a
cage on the wall. Again it cried:

‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,
Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’

The girl passed on, going from room to room of the house, but they were
all empty, and still she saw no one. At last she came to the cellar,
and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her head from
shaking. ‘Can you tell me,’ asked the girl, ‘if my betrothed husband
lives here?’

‘Ah, you poor child,’ answered the old woman, ‘what a place for you to
come to! This is a murderers’ den. You think yourself a promised bride,
and that your marriage will soon take place, but it is with death that
you will keep your marriage feast. Look, do you see that large cauldron
of water which I am obliged to keep on the fire! As soon as they have
you in their power they will kill you without mercy, and cook and eat
you, for they are eaters of men. If I did not take pity on you and save
you, you would be lost.’

Thereupon the old woman led her behind a large cask, which quite hid her
from view. ‘Keep as still as a mouse,’ she said; ‘do not move or speak,
or it will be all over with you. Tonight, when the robbers are
all asleep, we will flee together. I have long been waiting for an
opportunity to escape.’

The words were hardly out of her mouth when the godless crew returned,
dragging another young girl along with them. They were all drunk, and
paid no heed to her cries and lamentations. They gave her wine to drink,
three glasses full, one of white wine, one of red, and one of yellow,
and with that her heart gave way and she died. Then they tore off her
dainty clothing, laid her on a table, and cut her beautiful body into
pieces, and sprinkled salt upon it.

The poor betrothed girl crouched trembling and shuddering behind the
cask, for she saw what a terrible fate had been intended for her by
the robbers. One of them now noticed a gold ring still remaining on
the little finger of the murdered girl, and as he could not draw it off
easily, he took a hatchet and cut off the finger; but the finger sprang
into the air, and fell behind the cask into the lap of the girl who was
hiding there. The robber took a light and began looking for it, but he
could not find it. ‘Have you looked behind the large cask?’ said one of
the others. But the old woman called out, ‘Come and eat your suppers,
and let the thing be till tomorrow; the finger won’t run away.’

‘The old woman is right,’ said the robbers, and they ceased looking for
the finger and sat down.

The old woman then mixed a sleeping draught with their wine, and before
long they were all lying on the floor of the cellar, fast asleep and
snoring. As soon as the girl was assured of this, she came from behind
the cask. She was obliged to step over the bodies of the sleepers, who
were lying close together, and every moment she was filled with renewed
dread lest she should awaken them. But God helped her, so that she
passed safely over them, and then she and the old woman went upstairs,
opened the door, and hastened as fast as they could from the murderers’
den. They found the ashes scattered by the wind, but the peas and
lentils had sprouted, and grown sufficiently above the ground, to guide
them in the moonlight along the path. All night long they walked, and it
was morning before they reached the mill. Then the girl told her father
all that had happened.

The day came that had been fixed for the marriage. The bridegroom
arrived and also a large company of guests, for the miller had taken
care to invite all his friends and relations. As they sat at the feast,
each guest in turn was asked to tell a tale; the bride sat still and did
not say a word.

‘And you, my love,’ said the bridegroom, turning to her, ‘is there no
tale you know? Tell us something.’

‘I will tell you a dream, then,’ said the bride. ‘I went alone through a
forest and came at last to a house; not a soul could I find within, but
a bird that was hanging in a cage on the wall cried:

‘Turn back, turn back, young maiden fair,
Linger not in this murderers’ lair.’

and again a second time it said these words.’

‘My darling, this is only a dream.’

‘I went on through the house from room to room, but they were all empty,
and everything was so grim and mysterious. At last I went down to the
cellar, and there sat a very, very old woman, who could not keep her
head still. I asked her if my betrothed lived here, and she answered,
“Ah, you poor child, you are come to a murderers’ den; your betrothed
does indeed live here, but he will kill you without mercy and afterwards
cook and eat you.”’

‘My darling, this is only a dream.’

‘The old woman hid me behind a large cask, and scarcely had she done
this when the robbers returned home, dragging a young girl along with
them. They gave her three kinds of wine to drink, white, red, and
yellow, and with that she died.’

‘My darling, this is only a dream.’

‘Then they tore off her dainty clothing, and cut her beautiful body into
pieces and sprinkled salt upon it.’

‘My darling, this is only a dream.’

‘And one of the robbers saw that there was a gold ring still left on her
finger, and as it was difficult to draw off, he took a hatchet and cut
off her finger; but the finger sprang into the air and fell behind the
great cask into my lap. And here is the finger with the ring.’ And
with these words the bride drew forth the finger and shewed it to the
assembled guests.

The bridegroom, who during this recital had grown deadly pale, up and
tried to escape, but the guests seized him and held him fast. They
delivered him up to justice, and he and all his murderous band were
condemned to death for their wicked deeds.




TOM THUMB

A poor woodman sat in his cottage one night, smoking his pipe by the
fireside, while his wife sat by his side spinning. ‘How lonely it is,
wife,’ said he, as he puffed out a long curl of smoke, ‘for you and me
to sit here by ourselves, without any children to play about and amuse
us while other people seem so happy and merry with their children!’
‘What you say is very true,’ said the wife, sighing, and turning round
her wheel; ‘how happy should I be if I had but one child! If it were
ever so small--nay, if it were no bigger than my thumb--I should be very
happy, and love it dearly.’ Now--odd as you may think it--it came to
pass that this good woman’s wish was fulfilled, just in the very way she
had wished it; for, not long afterwards, she had a little boy, who was
quite healthy and strong, but was not much bigger than my thumb. So
they said, ‘Well, we cannot say we have not got what we wished for, and,
little as he is, we will love him dearly.’ And they called him Thomas
Thumb.

They gave him plenty of food, yet for all they could do he never grew
bigger, but kept just the same size as he had been when he was born.
Still, his eyes were sharp and sparkling, and he soon showed himself to
be a clever little fellow, who always knew well what he was about.

One day, as the woodman was getting ready to go into the wood to cut
fuel, he said, ‘I wish I had someone to bring the cart after me, for I
want to make haste.’ ‘Oh, father,’ cried Tom, ‘I will take care of that;
the cart shall be in the wood by the time you want it.’ Then the woodman
laughed, and said, ‘How can that be? you cannot reach up to the horse’s
bridle.’ ‘Never mind that, father,’ said Tom; ‘if my mother will only
harness the horse, I will get into his ear and tell him which way to
go.’ ‘Well,’ said the father, ‘we will try for once.’

When the time came the mother harnessed the horse to the cart, and put
Tom into his ear; and as he sat there the little man told the beast how
to go, crying out, ‘Go on!’ and ‘Stop!’ as he wanted: and thus the horse
went on just as well as if the woodman had driven it himself into the
wood. It happened that as the horse was going a little too fast, and Tom
was calling out, ‘Gently! gently!’ two strangers came up. ‘What an odd
thing that is!’ said one: ‘there is a cart going along, and I hear a
carter talking to the horse, but yet I can see no one.’ ‘That is queer,
indeed,’ said the other; ‘let us follow the cart, and see where it
goes.’ So they went on into the wood, till at last they came to the
place where the woodman was. Then Tom Thumb, seeing his father, cried
out, ‘See, father, here I am with the cart, all right and safe! now take
me down!’ So his father took hold of the horse with one hand, and with
the other took his son out of the horse’s ear, and put him down upon a
straw, where he sat as merry as you please.

The two strangers were all this time looking on, and did not know what
to say for wonder. At last one took the other aside, and said, ‘That
little urchin will make our fortune, if we can get him, and carry him
about from town to town as a show; we must buy him.’ So they went up to
the woodman, and asked him what he would take for the little man. ‘He
will be better off,’ said they, ‘with us than with you.’ ‘I won’t sell
him at all,’ said the father; ‘my own flesh and blood is dearer to me
than all the silver and gold in the world.’ But Tom, hearing of the
bargain they wanted to make, crept up his father’s coat to his shoulder
and whispered in his ear, ‘Take the money, father, and let them have me;
I’ll soon come back to you.’

So the woodman at last said he would sell Tom to the strangers for a
large piece of gold, and they paid the price. ‘Where would you like to
sit?’ said one of them. ‘Oh, put me on the rim of your hat; that will be
a nice gallery for me; I can walk about there and see the country as we
go along.’ So they did as he wished; and when Tom had taken leave of his
father they took him away with them.

They journeyed on till it began to be dusky, and then the little man
said, ‘Let me get down, I’m tired.’ So the man took off his hat, and
put him down on a clod of earth, in a ploughed field by the side of the
road. But Tom ran about amongst the furrows, and at last slipped into
an old mouse-hole. ‘Good night, my masters!’ said he, ‘I’m off! mind and
look sharp after me the next time.’ Then they ran at once to the place,
and poked the ends of their sticks into the mouse-hole, but all in vain;
Tom only crawled farther and farther in; and at last it became quite
dark, so that they were forced to go their way without their prize, as
sulky as could be.

When Tom found they were gone, he came out of his hiding-place. ‘What
dangerous walking it is,’ said he, ‘in this ploughed field! If I were to
fall from one of these great clods, I should undoubtedly break my neck.’
At last, by good luck, he found a large empty snail-shell. ‘This is
lucky,’ said he, ‘I can sleep here very well’; and in he crept.

Just as he was falling asleep, he heard two men passing by, chatting
together; and one said to the other, ‘How can we rob that rich parson’s
house of his silver and gold?’ ‘I’ll tell you!’ cried Tom. ‘What noise
was that?’ said the thief, frightened; ‘I’m sure I heard someone speak.’
They stood still listening, and Tom said, ‘Take me with you, and I’ll
soon show you how to get the parson’s money.’ ‘But where are you?’ said
they. ‘Look about on the ground,’ answered he, ‘and listen where the
sound comes from.’ At last the thieves found him out, and lifted him
up in their hands. ‘You little urchin!’ they said, ‘what can you do for
us?’ ‘Why, I can get between the iron window-bars of the parson’s house,
and throw you out whatever you want.’ ‘That’s a good thought,’ said the
thieves; ‘come along, we shall see what you can do.’

When they came to the parson’s house, Tom slipped through the
window-bars into the room, and then called out as loud as he could bawl,
‘Will you have all that is here?’ At this the thieves were frightened,
and said, ‘Softly, softly! Speak low, that you may not awaken anybody.’
But Tom seemed as if he did not understand them, and bawled out again,
‘How much will you have? Shall I throw it all out?’ Now the cook lay in
the next room; and hearing a noise she raised herself up in her bed and
listened. Meantime the thieves were frightened, and ran off a little
way; but at last they plucked up their hearts, and said, ‘The little
urchin is only trying to make fools of us.’ So they came back and
whispered softly to him, saying, ‘Now let us have no more of your
roguish jokes; but throw us out some of the money.’ Then Tom called out
as loud as he could, ‘Very well! hold your hands! here it comes.’

The cook heard this quite plain, so she sprang out of bed, and ran to
open the door. The thieves ran off as if a wolf was at their tails: and
the maid, having groped about and found nothing, went away for a light.
By the time she came back, Tom had slipped off into the barn; and when
she had looked about and searched every hole and corner, and found
nobody, she went to bed, thinking she must have been dreaming with her
eyes open.

The little man crawled about in the hay-loft, and at last found a snug
place to finish his night’s rest in; so he laid himself down, meaning
to sleep till daylight, and then find his way home to his father and
mother. But alas! how woefully he was undone! what crosses and sorrows
happen to us all in this world! The cook got up early, before daybreak,
to feed the cows; and going straight to the hay-loft, carried away
a large bundle of hay, with the little man in the middle of it, fast
asleep. He still, however, slept on, and did not awake till he found
himself in the mouth of the cow; for the cook had put the hay into the
cow’s rick, and the cow had taken Tom up in a mouthful of it. ‘Good
lack-a-day!’ said he, ‘how came I to tumble into the mill?’ But he soon
found out where he really was; and was forced to have all his wits about
him, that he might not get between the cow’s teeth, and so be crushed to
death. At last down he went into her stomach. ‘It is rather dark,’ said
he; ‘they forgot to build windows in this room to let the sun in; a
candle would be no bad thing.’

Though he made the best of his bad luck, he did not like his quarters at
all; and the worst of it was, that more and more hay was always coming
down, and the space left for him became smaller and smaller. At last he
cried out as loud as he could, ‘Don’t bring me any more hay! Don’t bring
me any more hay!’

The maid happened to be just then milking the cow; and hearing someone
speak, but seeing nobody, and yet being quite sure it was the same voice
that she had heard in the night, she was so frightened that she fell off
her stool, and overset the milk-pail. As soon as she could pick herself
up out of the dirt, she ran off as fast as she could to her master the
parson, and said, ‘Sir, sir, the cow is talking!’ But the parson
said, ‘Woman, thou art surely mad!’ However, he went with her into the
cow-house, to try and see what was the matter.

Scarcely had they set foot on the threshold, when Tom called out, ‘Don’t
bring me any more hay!’ Then the parson himself was frightened; and
thinking the cow was surely bewitched, told his man to kill her on the
spot. So the cow was killed, and cut up; and the stomach, in which Tom
lay, was thrown out upon a dunghill.

Tom soon set himself to work to get out, which was not a very easy
task; but at last, just as he had made room to get his head out, fresh
ill-luck befell him. A hungry wolf sprang out, and swallowed up the
whole stomach, with Tom in it, at one gulp, and ran away.

Tom, however, was still not disheartened; and thinking the wolf would
not dislike having some chat with him as he was going along, he called
out, ‘My good friend, I can show you a famous treat.’ ‘Where’s that?’
said the wolf. ‘In such and such a house,’ said Tom, describing his own
father’s house. ‘You can crawl through the drain into the kitchen and
then into the pantry, and there you will find cakes, ham, beef, cold
chicken, roast pig, apple-dumplings, and everything that your heart can
wish.’

The wolf did not want to be asked twice; so that very night he went to
the house and crawled through the drain into the kitchen, and then into
the pantry, and ate and drank there to his heart’s content. As soon as
he had had enough he wanted to get away; but he had eaten so much that
he could not go out by the same way he came in.

This was just what Tom had reckoned upon; and now he began to set up a
great shout, making all the noise he could. ‘Will you be easy?’ said the
wolf; ‘you’ll awaken everybody in the house if you make such a clatter.’
‘What’s that to me?’ said the little man; ‘you have had your frolic, now
I’ve a mind to be merry myself’; and he began, singing and shouting as
loud as he could.

The woodman and his wife, being awakened by the noise, peeped through
a crack in the door; but when they saw a wolf was there, you may well
suppose that they were sadly frightened; and the woodman ran for his
axe, and gave his wife a scythe. ‘Do you stay behind,’ said the woodman,
‘and when I have knocked him on the head you must rip him up with the
scythe.’ Tom heard all this, and cried out, ‘Father, father! I am here,
the wolf has swallowed me.’ And his father said, ‘Heaven be praised! we
have found our dear child again’; and he told his wife not to use the
scythe for fear she should hurt him. Then he aimed a great blow, and
struck the wolf on the head, and killed him on the spot! and when he was
dead they cut open his body, and set Tommy free. ‘Ah!’ said the father,
‘what fears we have had for you!’ ‘Yes, father,’ answered he; ‘I have
travelled all over the world, I think, in one way or other, since we
parted; and now I am very glad to come home and get fresh air again.’
‘Why, where have you been?’ said his father. ‘I have been in a
mouse-hole--and in a snail-shell--and down a cow’s throat--and in the
wolf’s belly; and yet here I am again, safe and sound.’

‘Well,’ said they, ‘you are come back, and we will not sell you again
for all the riches in the world.’

Then they hugged and kissed their dear little son, and gave him plenty
to eat and drink, for he was very hungry; and then they fetched new
clothes for him, for his old ones had been quite spoiled on his journey.
So Master Thumb stayed at home with his father and mother, in peace; for
though he had been so great a traveller, and had done and seen so many
fine things, and was fond enough of telling the whole story, he always
agreed that, after all, there’s no place like HOME!




RUMPELSTILTSKIN

By the side of a wood, in a country a long way off, ran a fine stream
of water; and upon the stream there stood a mill. The miller’s house was
close by, and the miller, you must know, had a very beautiful daughter.
She was, moreover, very shrewd and clever; and the miller was so proud
of her, that he one day told the king of the land, who used to come and
hunt in the wood, that his daughter could spin gold out of straw. Now
this king was very fond of money; and when he heard the miller’s boast
his greediness was raised, and he sent for the girl to be brought before
him. Then he led her to a chamber in his palace where there was a great
heap of straw, and gave her a spinning-wheel, and said, ‘All this must
be spun into gold before morning, as you love your life.’ It was in vain
that the poor maiden said that it was only a silly boast of her father,
for that she could do no such thing as spin straw into gold: the chamber
door was locked, and she was left alone.

She sat down in one corner of the room, and began to bewail her hard
fate; when on a sudden the door opened, and a droll-looking little man
hobbled in, and said, ‘Good morrow to you, my good lass; what are you
weeping for?’ ‘Alas!’ said she, ‘I must spin this straw into gold, and
I know not how.’ ‘What will you give me,’ said the hobgoblin, ‘to do it
for you?’ ‘My necklace,’ replied the maiden. He took her at her word,
and sat himself down to the wheel, and whistled and sang:

‘Round about, round about,
  Lo and behold!
Reel away, reel away,
  Straw into gold!’

And round about the wheel went merrily; the work was quickly done, and
the straw was all spun into gold.

When the king came and saw this, he was greatly astonished and pleased;
but his heart grew still more greedy of gain, and he shut up the poor
miller’s daughter again with a fresh task. Then she knew not what to do,
and sat down once more to weep; but the dwarf soon opened the door, and
said, ‘What will you give me to do your task?’ ‘The ring on my finger,’
said she. So her little friend took the ring, and began to work at the
wheel again, and whistled and sang:

‘Round about, round about,
  Lo and behold!
Reel away, reel away,
  Straw into gold!’

till, long before morning, all was done again.

The king was greatly delighted to see all this glittering treasure;
but still he had not enough: so he took the miller’s daughter to a yet
larger heap, and said, ‘All this must be spun tonight; and if it is,
you shall be my queen.’ As soon as she was alone that dwarf came in, and
said, ‘What will you give me to spin gold for you this third time?’
‘I have nothing left,’ said she. ‘Then say you will give me,’ said
the little man, ‘the first little child that you may have when you are
queen.’ ‘That may never be,’ thought the miller’s daughter: and as she
knew no other way to get her task done, she said she would do what he
asked. Round went the wheel again to the old song, and the manikin once
more spun the heap into gold. The king came in the morning, and, finding
all he wanted, was forced to keep his word; so he married the miller’s
daughter, and she really became queen.

At the birth of her first little child she was very glad, and forgot the
dwarf, and what she had said. But one day he came into her room, where
she was sitting playing with her baby, and put her in mind of it. Then
she grieved sorely at her misfortune, and said she would give him all
the wealth of the kingdom if he would let her off, but in vain; till at
last her tears softened him, and he said, ‘I will give you three days’
grace, and if during that time you tell me my name, you shall keep your
child.’

Now the queen lay awake all night, thinking of all the odd names that
she had ever heard; and she sent messengers all over the land to find
out new ones. The next day the little man came, and she began with
TIMOTHY, ICHABOD, BENJAMIN, JEREMIAH, and all the names she could
remember; but to all and each of them he said, ‘Madam, that is not my
name.’

The second day she began with all the comical names she could hear of,
BANDY-LEGS, HUNCHBACK, CROOK-SHANKS, and so on; but the little gentleman
still said to every one of them, ‘Madam, that is not my name.’

The third day one of the messengers came back, and said, ‘I have
travelled two days without hearing of any other names; but yesterday, as
I was climbing a high hill, among the trees of the forest where the fox
and the hare bid each other good night, I saw a little hut; and before
the hut burnt a fire; and round about the fire a funny little dwarf was
dancing upon one leg, and singing:

“Merrily the feast I’ll make.
Today I’ll brew, tomorrow bake;
Merrily I’ll dance and sing,
For next day will a stranger bring.
Little does my lady dream
Rumpelstiltskin is my name!”

When the queen heard this she jumped for joy, and as soon as her little
friend came she sat down upon her throne, and called all her court round
to enjoy the fun; and the nurse stood by her side with the baby in her
arms, as if it was quite ready to be given up. Then the little man began
to chuckle at the thought of having the poor child, to take home with
him to his hut in the woods; and he cried out, ‘Now, lady, what is my
name?’ ‘Is it JOHN?’ asked she. ‘No, madam!’ ‘Is it TOM?’ ‘No, madam!’
‘Is it JEMMY?’ ‘It is not.’ ‘Can your name be RUMPELSTILTSKIN?’ said the
lady slyly. ‘Some witch told you that!--some witch told you that!’ cried
the little man, and dashed his right foot in a rage so deep into the
floor, that he was forced to lay hold of it with both hands to pull it
out.

Then he made the best of his way off, while the nurse laughed and the
baby crowed; and all the court jeered at him for having had so much
trouble for nothing, and said, ‘We wish you a very good morning, and a
merry feast, Mr RUMPLESTILTSKIN!’




CLEVER GRETEL

There was once a cook named Gretel, who wore shoes with red heels, and
when she walked out with them on, she turned herself this way and that,
was quite happy and thought: ‘You certainly are a pretty girl!’ And when
she came home she drank, in her gladness of heart, a draught of wine,
and as wine excites a desire to eat, she tasted the best of whatever she
was cooking until she was satisfied, and said: ‘The cook must know what
the food is like.’

It came to pass that the master one day said to her: ‘Gretel, there is a
guest coming this evening; prepare me two fowls very daintily.’ ‘I will
see to it, master,’ answered Gretel. She killed two fowls, scalded them,
plucked them, put them on the spit, and towards evening set them before
the fire, that they might roast. The fowls began to turn brown, and were
nearly ready, but the guest had not yet arrived. Then Gretel called out
to her master: ‘If the guest does not come, I must take the fowls away
from the fire, but it will be a sin and a shame if they are not eaten
the moment they are at their juiciest.’ The master said: ‘I will run
myself, and fetch the guest.’ When the master had turned his back,
Gretel laid the spit with the fowls on one side, and thought: ‘Standing
so long by the fire there, makes one sweat and thirsty; who knows
when they will come? Meanwhile, I will run into the cellar, and take a
drink.’ She ran down, set a jug, said: ‘God bless it for you, Gretel,’
and took a good drink, and thought that wine should flow on, and should
not be interrupted, and took yet another hearty draught.

Then she went and put the fowls down again to the fire, basted them,
and drove the spit merrily round. But as the roast meat smelt so good,
Gretel thought: ‘Something might be wrong, it ought to be tasted!’
She touched it with her finger, and said: ‘Ah! how good fowls are! It
certainly is a sin and a shame that they are not eaten at the right
time!’ She ran to the window, to see if the master was not coming with
his guest, but she saw no one, and went back to the fowls and thought:
‘One of the wings is burning! I had better take it off and eat it.’
So she cut it off, ate it, and enjoyed it, and when she had done, she
thought: ‘The other must go down too, or else master will observe that
something is missing.’ When the two wings were eaten, she went and
looked for her master, and did not see him. It suddenly occurred to
her: ‘Who knows? They are perhaps not coming at all, and have turned in
somewhere.’ Then she said: ‘Well, Gretel, enjoy yourself, one fowl has
been cut into, take another drink, and eat it up entirely; when it is
eaten you will have some peace, why should God’s good gifts be spoilt?’
So she ran into the cellar again, took an enormous drink and ate up the
one chicken in great glee. When one of the chickens was swallowed down,
and still her master did not come, Gretel looked at the other and said:
‘What one is, the other should be likewise, the two go together; what’s
right for the one is right for the other; I think if I were to take
another draught it would do me no harm.’ So she took another hearty
drink, and let the second chicken follow the first.

While she was making the most of it, her master came and cried: ‘Hurry
up, Gretel, the guest is coming directly after me!’ ‘Yes, sir, I will
soon serve up,’ answered Gretel. Meantime the master looked to see that
the table was properly laid, and took the great knife, wherewith he was
going to carve the chickens, and sharpened it on the steps. Presently
the guest came, and knocked politely and courteously at the house-door.
Gretel ran, and looked to see who was there, and when she saw the guest,
she put her finger to her lips and said: ‘Hush! hush! go away as quickly
as you can, if my master catches you it will be the worse for you; he
certainly did ask you to supper, but his intention is to cut off your
two ears. Just listen how he is sharpening the knife for it!’ The guest
heard the sharpening, and hurried down the steps again as fast as he
could. Gretel was not idle; she ran screaming to her master, and cried:
‘You have invited a fine guest!’ ‘Why, Gretel? What do you mean by
that?’ ‘Yes,’ said she, ‘he has taken the chickens which I was just
going to serve up, off the dish, and has run away with them!’ ‘That’s a
nice trick!’ said her master, and lamented the fine chickens. ‘If he had
but left me one, so that something remained for me to eat.’ He called to
him to stop, but the guest pretended not to hear. Then he ran after him
with the knife still in his hand, crying: ‘Just one, just one,’ meaning
that the guest should leave him just one chicken, and not take both. The
guest, however, thought no otherwise than that he was to give up one of
his ears, and ran as if fire were burning under him, in order to take
them both with him.




THE OLD MAN AND HIS GRANDSON

There was once a very old man, whose eyes had become dim, his ears dull
of hearing, his knees trembled, and when he sat at table he could hardly
hold the spoon, and spilt the broth upon the table-cloth or let it run
out of his mouth. His son and his son’s wife were disgusted at this, so
the old grandfather at last had to sit in the corner behind the stove,
and they gave him his food in an earthenware bowl, and not even enough
of it. And he used to look towards the table with his eyes full of
tears. Once, too, his trembling hands could not hold the bowl, and it
fell to the ground and broke. The young wife scolded him, but he said
nothing and only sighed. Then they brought him a wooden bowl for a few
half-pence, out of which he had to eat.

They were once sitting thus when the little grandson of four years old
began to gather together some bits of wood upon the ground. ‘What are
you doing there?’ asked the father. ‘I am making a little trough,’
answered the child, ‘for father and mother to eat out of when I am big.’

The man and his wife looked at each other for a while, and presently
began to cry. Then they took the old grandfather to the table, and
henceforth always let him eat with them, and likewise said nothing if he
did spill a little of anything.




THE LITTLE PEASANT

There was a certain village wherein no one lived but really rich
peasants, and just one poor one, whom they called the little peasant. He
had not even so much as a cow, and still less money to buy one, and
yet he and his wife did so wish to have one. One day he said to her:
‘Listen, I have a good idea, there is our gossip the carpenter, he shall
make us a wooden calf, and paint it brown, so that it looks like any
other, and in time it will certainly get big and be a cow.’ the woman
also liked the idea, and their gossip the carpenter cut and planed
the calf, and painted it as it ought to be, and made it with its head
hanging down as if it were eating.

Next morning when the cows were being driven out, the little peasant
called the cow-herd in and said: ‘Look, I have a little calf there,
but it is still small and has to be carried.’ The cow-herd said: ‘All
right,’ and took it in his arms and carried it to the pasture, and set
it among the grass. The little calf always remained standing like one
which was eating, and the cow-herd said: ‘It will soon run by itself,
just look how it eats already!’ At night when he was going to drive the
herd home again, he said to the calf: ‘If you can stand there and eat
your fill, you can also go on your four legs; I don’t care to drag you
home again in my arms.’ But the little peasant stood at his door, and
waited for his little calf, and when the cow-herd drove the cows through
the village, and the calf was missing, he inquired where it was. The
cow-herd answered: ‘It is still standing out there eating. It would not
stop and come with us.’ But the little peasant said: ‘Oh, but I must
have my beast back again.’ Then they went back to the meadow together,
but someone had stolen the calf, and it was gone. The cow-herd said: ‘It
must have run away.’ The peasant, however, said: ‘Don’t tell me
that,’ and led the cow-herd before the mayor, who for his carelessness
condemned him to give the peasant a cow for the calf which had run away.

And now the little peasant and his wife had the cow for which they had
so long wished, and they were heartily glad, but they had no food for
it, and could give it nothing to eat, so it soon had to be killed. They
salted the flesh, and the peasant went into the town and wanted to sell
the skin there, so that he might buy a new calf with the proceeds. On
the way he passed by a mill, and there sat a raven with broken wings,
and out of pity he took him and wrapped him in the skin. But as the
weather grew so bad and there was a storm of rain and wind, he could
go no farther, and turned back to the mill and begged for shelter. The
miller’s wife was alone in the house, and said to the peasant: ‘Lay
yourself on the straw there,’ and gave him a slice of bread and cheese.
The peasant ate it, and lay down with his skin beside him, and the woman
thought: ‘He is tired and has gone to sleep.’ In the meantime came the
parson; the miller’s wife received him well, and said: ‘My husband is
out, so we will have a feast.’ The peasant listened, and when he heard
them talk about feasting he was vexed that he had been forced to make
shift with a slice of bread and cheese. Then the woman served up four
different things, roast meat, salad, cakes, and wine.

Just as they were about to sit down and eat, there was a knocking
outside. The woman said: ‘Oh, heavens! It is my husband!’ she quickly
hid the roast meat inside the tiled stove, the wine under the pillow,
the salad on the bed, the cakes under it, and the parson in the closet
on the porch. Then she opened the door for her husband, and said: ‘Thank
heaven, you are back again! There is such a storm, it looks as if the
world were coming to an end.’ The miller saw the peasant lying on the
straw, and asked, ‘What is that fellow doing there?’ ‘Ah,’ said the
wife, ‘the poor knave came in the storm and rain, and begged for
shelter, so I gave him a bit of bread and cheese, and showed him where
the straw was.’ The man said: ‘I have no objection, but be quick and get
me something to eat.’ The woman said: ‘But I have nothing but bread and
cheese.’ ‘I am contented with anything,’ replied the husband, ‘so far as
I am concerned, bread and cheese will do,’ and looked at the peasant and
said: ‘Come and eat some more with me.’ The peasant did not require to
be invited twice, but got up and ate. After this the miller saw the skin
in which the raven was, lying on the ground, and asked: ‘What have you
there?’ The peasant answered: ‘I have a soothsayer inside it.’ ‘Can
he foretell anything to me?’ said the miller. ‘Why not?’ answered
the peasant: ‘but he only says four things, and the fifth he keeps to
himself.’ The miller was curious, and said: ‘Let him foretell something
for once.’ Then the peasant pinched the raven’s head, so that he croaked
and made a noise like krr, krr. The miller said: ‘What did he say?’ The
peasant answered: ‘In the first place, he says that there is some wine
hidden under the pillow.’ ‘Bless me!’ cried the miller, and went there
and found the wine. ‘Now go on,’ said he. The peasant made the raven
croak again, and said: ‘In the second place, he says that there is some
roast meat in the tiled stove.’ ‘Upon my word!’ cried the miller, and
went thither, and found the roast meat. The peasant made the raven
prophesy still more, and said: ‘Thirdly, he says that there is some
salad on the bed.’ ‘That would be a fine thing!’ cried the miller, and
went there and found the salad. At last the peasant pinched the raven
once more till he croaked, and said: ‘Fourthly, he says that there
are some cakes under the bed.’ ‘That would be a fine thing!’ cried the
miller, and looked there, and found the cakes.

And now the two sat down to the table together, but the miller’s wife
was frightened to death, and went to bed and took all the keys with
her. The miller would have liked much to know the fifth, but the little
peasant said: ‘First, we will quickly eat the four things, for the fifth
is something bad.’ So they ate, and after that they bargained how much
the miller was to give for the fifth prophecy, until they agreed on
three hundred talers. Then the peasant once more pinched the raven’s
head till he croaked loudly. The miller asked: ‘What did he say?’ The
peasant replied: ‘He says that the Devil is hiding outside there in
the closet on the porch.’ The miller said: ‘The Devil must go out,’ and
opened the house-door; then the woman was forced to give up the keys,
and the peasant unlocked the closet. The parson ran out as fast as he
could, and the miller said: ‘It was true; I saw the black rascal with my
own eyes.’ The peasant, however, made off next morning by daybreak with
the three hundred talers.

At home the small peasant gradually launched out; he built a beautiful
house, and the peasants said: ‘The small peasant has certainly been to
the place where golden snow falls, and people carry the gold home in
shovels.’ Then the small peasant was brought before the mayor, and
bidden to say from whence his wealth came. He answered: ‘I sold my cow’s
skin in the town, for three hundred talers.’ When the peasants heard
that, they too wished to enjoy this great profit, and ran home, killed
all their cows, and stripped off their skins in order to sell them in
the town to the greatest advantage. The mayor, however, said: ‘But my
servant must go first.’ When she came to the merchant in the town, he
did not give her more than two talers for a skin, and when the others
came, he did not give them so much, and said: ‘What can I do with all
these skins?’

Then the peasants were vexed that the small peasant should have thus
outwitted them, wanted to take vengeance on him, and accused him of this
treachery before the mayor. The innocent little peasant was unanimously
sentenced to death, and was to be rolled into the water, in a barrel
pierced full of holes. He was led forth, and a priest was brought who
was to say a mass for his soul. The others were all obliged to retire to
a distance, and when the peasant looked at the priest, he recognized the
man who had been with the miller’s wife. He said to him: ‘I set you free
from the closet, set me free from the barrel.’ At this same moment up
came, with a flock of sheep, the very shepherd whom the peasant knew had
long been wishing to be mayor, so he cried with all his might: ‘No, I
will not do it; if the whole world insists on it, I will not do it!’ The
shepherd hearing that, came up to him, and asked: ‘What are you about?
What is it that you will not do?’ The peasant said: ‘They want to make
me mayor, if I will but put myself in the barrel, but I will not do it.’
The shepherd said: ‘If nothing more than that is needful in order to be
mayor, I would get into the barrel at once.’ The peasant said: ‘If you
will get in, you will be mayor.’ The shepherd was willing, and got in,
and the peasant shut the top down on him; then he took the shepherd’s
flock for himself, and drove it away. The parson went to the crowd,
and declared that the mass had been said. Then they came and rolled the
barrel towards the water. When the barrel began to roll, the shepherd
cried: ‘I am quite willing to be mayor.’ They believed no otherwise than
that it was the peasant who was saying this, and answered: ‘That is
what we intend, but first you shall look about you a little down below
there,’ and they rolled the barrel down into the water.

After that the peasants went home, and as they were entering the
village, the small peasant also came quietly in, driving a flock of
sheep and looking quite contented. Then the peasants were astonished,
and said: ‘Peasant, from whence do you come? Have you come out of the
water?’ ‘Yes, truly,’ replied the peasant, ‘I sank deep, deep down,
until at last I got to the bottom; I pushed the bottom out of the
barrel, and crept out, and there were pretty meadows on which a number
of lambs were feeding, and from thence I brought this flock away with
me.’ Said the peasants: ‘Are there any more there?’ ‘Oh, yes,’ said he,
‘more than I could want.’ Then the peasants made up their minds that
they too would fetch some sheep for themselves, a flock apiece, but the
mayor said: ‘I come first.’ So they went to the water together, and just
then there were some of the small fleecy clouds in the blue sky, which
are called little lambs, and they were reflected in the water, whereupon
the peasants cried: ‘We already see the sheep down below!’ The mayor
pressed forward and said: ‘I will go down first, and look about me, and
if things promise well I’ll call you.’ So he jumped in; splash! went
the water; it sounded as if he were calling them, and the whole crowd
plunged in after him as one man. Then the entire village was dead, and
the small peasant, as sole heir, became a rich man.




FREDERICK AND CATHERINE

There was once a man called Frederick: he had a wife whose name was
Catherine, and they had not long been married. One day Frederick said.
‘Kate! I am going to work in the fields; when I come back I shall be
hungry so let me have something nice cooked, and a good draught of ale.’
‘Very well,’ said she, ‘it shall all be ready.’ When dinner-time drew
nigh, Catherine took a nice steak, which was all the meat she had, and
put it on the fire to fry. The steak soon began to look brown, and to
crackle in the pan; and Catherine stood by with a fork and turned it:
then she said to herself, ‘The steak is almost ready, I may as well go
to the cellar for the ale.’ So she left the pan on the fire and took a
large jug and went into the cellar and tapped the ale cask. The beer ran
into the jug and Catherine stood looking on. At last it popped into her
head, ‘The dog is not shut up--he may be running away with the steak;
that’s well thought of.’ So up she ran from the cellar; and sure enough
the rascally cur had got the steak in his mouth, and was making off with
it.

Away ran Catherine, and away ran the dog across the field: but he ran
faster than she, and stuck close to the steak. ‘It’s all gone, and “what
can’t be cured must be endured”,’ said Catherine. So she turned round;
and as she had run a good way and was tired, she walked home leisurely
to cool herself.

Now all this time the ale was running too, for Catherine had not turned
the cock; and when the jug was full the liquor ran upon the floor till
the cask was empty. When she got to the cellar stairs she saw what had
happened. ‘My stars!’ said she, ‘what shall I do to keep Frederick from
seeing all this slopping about?’ So she thought a while; and at last
remembered that there was a sack of fine meal bought at the last fair,
and that if she sprinkled this over the floor it would suck up the ale
nicely. ‘What a lucky thing,’ said she, ‘that we kept that meal! we have
now a good use for it.’ So away she went for it: but she managed to set
it down just upon the great jug full of beer, and upset it; and thus
all the ale that had been saved was set swimming on the floor also. ‘Ah!
well,’ said she, ‘when one goes another may as well follow.’ Then she
strewed the meal all about the cellar, and was quite pleased with her
cleverness, and said, ‘How very neat and clean it looks!’

At noon Frederick came home. ‘Now, wife,’ cried he, ‘what have you for
dinner?’ ‘O Frederick!’ answered she, ‘I was cooking you a steak; but
while I went down to draw the ale, the dog ran away with it; and while
I ran after him, the ale ran out; and when I went to dry up the ale
with the sack of meal that we got at the fair, I upset the jug: but the
cellar is now quite dry, and looks so clean!’ ‘Kate, Kate,’ said he,
‘how could you do all this?’ Why did you leave the steak to fry, and the
ale to run, and then spoil all the meal?’ ‘Why, Frederick,’ said she, ‘I
did not know I was doing wrong; you should have told me before.’

The husband thought to himself, ‘If my wife manages matters thus, I must
look sharp myself.’ Now he had a good deal of gold in the house: so he
said to Catherine, ‘What pretty yellow buttons these are! I shall put
them into a box and bury them in the garden; but take care that you
never go near or meddle with them.’ ‘No, Frederick,’ said she, ‘that
I never will.’ As soon as he was gone, there came by some pedlars with
earthenware plates and dishes, and they asked her whether she would buy.
‘Oh dear me, I should like to buy very much, but I have no money: if
you had any use for yellow buttons, I might deal with you.’ ‘Yellow
buttons!’ said they: ‘let us have a look at them.’ ‘Go into the garden
and dig where I tell you, and you will find the yellow buttons: I dare
not go myself.’ So the rogues went: and when they found what these
yellow buttons were, they took them all away, and left her plenty of
plates and dishes. Then she set them all about the house for a show:
and when Frederick came back, he cried out, ‘Kate, what have you been
doing?’ ‘See,’ said she, ‘I have bought all these with your yellow
buttons: but I did not touch them myself; the pedlars went themselves
and dug them up.’ ‘Wife, wife,’ said Frederick, ‘what a pretty piece of
work you have made! those yellow buttons were all my money: how came you
to do such a thing?’ ‘Why,’ answered she, ‘I did not know there was any
harm in it; you should have told me.’

Catherine stood musing for a while, and at last said to her husband,
‘Hark ye, Frederick, we will soon get the gold back: let us run after
the thieves.’ ‘Well, we will try,’ answered he; ‘but take some butter
and cheese with you, that we may have something to eat by the way.’
‘Very well,’ said she; and they set out: and as Frederick walked the
fastest, he left his wife some way behind. ‘It does not matter,’ thought
she: ‘when we turn back, I shall be so much nearer home than he.’

Presently she came to the top of a hill, down the side of which there
was a road so narrow that the cart wheels always chafed the trees
on each side as they passed. ‘Ah, see now,’ said she, ‘how they have
bruised and wounded those poor trees; they will never get well.’ So she
took pity on them, and made use of the butter to grease them all, so
that the wheels might not hurt them so much. While she was doing this
kind office one of her cheeses fell out of the basket, and rolled down
the hill. Catherine looked, but could not see where it had gone; so she
said, ‘Well, I suppose the other will go the same way and find you; he
has younger legs than I have.’ Then she rolled the other cheese after
it; and away it went, nobody knows where, down the hill. But she said
she supposed that they knew the road, and would follow her, and she
could not stay there all day waiting for them.

At last she overtook Frederick, who desired her to give him something to
eat. Then she gave him the dry bread. ‘Where are the butter and cheese?’
said he. ‘Oh!’ answered she, ‘I used the butter to grease those poor
trees that the wheels chafed so: and one of the cheeses ran away so I
sent the other after it to find it, and I suppose they are both on
the road together somewhere.’ ‘What a goose you are to do such silly
things!’ said the husband. ‘How can you say so?’ said she; ‘I am sure
you never told me not.’

They ate the dry bread together; and Frederick said, ‘Kate, I hope you
locked the door safe when you came away.’ ‘No,’ answered she, ‘you did
not tell me.’ ‘Then go home, and do it now before we go any farther,’
said Frederick, ‘and bring with you something to eat.’

Catherine did as he told her, and thought to herself by the way,
‘Frederick wants something to eat; but I don’t think he is very fond of
butter and cheese: I’ll bring him a bag of fine nuts, and the vinegar,
for I have often seen him take some.’

When she reached home, she bolted the back door, but the front door she
took off the hinges, and said, ‘Frederick told me to lock the door, but
surely it can nowhere be so safe if I take it with me.’ So she took
her time by the way; and when she overtook her husband she cried
out, ‘There, Frederick, there is the door itself, you may watch it as
carefully as you please.’ ‘Alas! alas!’ said he, ‘what a clever wife I
have! I sent you to make the house fast, and you take the door away, so
that everybody may go in and out as they please--however, as you have
brought the door, you shall carry it about with you for your pains.’
‘Very well,’ answered she, ‘I’ll carry the door; but I’ll not carry the
nuts and vinegar bottle also--that would be too much of a load; so if
you please, I’ll fasten them to the door.’

Frederick of course made no objection to that plan, and they set off
into the wood to look for the thieves; but they could not find them: and
when it grew dark, they climbed up into a tree to spend the night there.
Scarcely were they up, than who should come by but the very rogues they
were looking for. They were in truth great rascals, and belonged to that
class of people who find things before they are lost; they were tired;
so they sat down and made a fire under the very tree where Frederick and
Catherine were. Frederick slipped down on the other side, and picked up
some stones. Then he climbed up again, and tried to hit the thieves on
the head with them: but they only said, ‘It must be near morning, for
the wind shakes the fir-apples down.’

Catherine, who had the door on her shoulder, began to be very tired;
but she thought it was the nuts upon it that were so heavy: so she said
softly, ‘Frederick, I must let the nuts go.’ ‘No,’ answered he, ‘not
now, they will discover us.’ ‘I can’t help that: they must go.’ ‘Well,
then, make haste and throw them down, if you will.’ Then away rattled
the nuts down among the boughs and one of the thieves cried, ‘Bless me,
it is hailing.’

A little while after, Catherine thought the door was still very heavy:
so she whispered to Frederick, ‘I must throw the vinegar down.’ ‘Pray
don’t,’ answered he, ‘it will discover us.’ ‘I can’t help that,’ said
she, ‘go it must.’ So she poured all the vinegar down; and the thieves
said, ‘What a heavy dew there is!’

At last it popped into Catherine’s head that it was the door itself that
was so heavy all the time: so she whispered, ‘Frederick, I must throw
the door down soon.’ But he begged and prayed her not to do so, for he
was sure it would betray them. ‘Here goes, however,’ said she: and down
went the door with such a clatter upon the thieves, that they cried
out ‘Murder!’ and not knowing what was coming, ran away as fast as they
could, and left all the gold. So when Frederick and Catherine came down,
there they found all their money safe and sound.




SWEETHEART ROLAND

There was once upon a time a woman who was a real witch and had two
daughters, one ugly and wicked, and this one she loved because she was
her own daughter, and one beautiful and good, and this one she hated,
because she was her stepdaughter. The stepdaughter once had a pretty
apron, which the other fancied so much that she became envious, and
told her mother that she must and would have that apron. ‘Be quiet, my
child,’ said the old woman, ‘and you shall have it. Your stepsister has
long deserved death; tonight when she is asleep I will come and cut her
head off. Only be careful that you are at the far side of the bed, and
push her well to the front.’ It would have been all over with the poor
girl if she had not just then been standing in a corner, and heard
everything. All day long she dared not go out of doors, and when bedtime
had come, the witch’s daughter got into bed first, so as to lie at the
far side, but when she was asleep, the other pushed her gently to the
front, and took for herself the place at the back, close by the wall. In
the night, the old woman came creeping in, she held an axe in her right
hand, and felt with her left to see if anyone were lying at the outside,
and then she grasped the axe with both hands, and cut her own child’s
head off.

When she had gone away, the girl got up and went to her sweetheart, who
was called Roland, and knocked at his door. When he came out, she said
to him: ‘Listen, dearest Roland, we must fly in all haste; my stepmother
wanted to kill me, but has struck her own child. When daylight comes,
and she sees what she has done, we shall be lost.’ ‘But,’ said Roland,
‘I counsel you first to take away her magic wand, or we cannot escape
if she pursues us.’ The maiden fetched the magic wand, and she took the
dead girl’s head and dropped three drops of blood on the ground, one in
front of the bed, one in the kitchen, and one on the stairs. Then she
hurried away with her lover.

When the old witch got up next morning, she called her daughter, and
wanted to give her the apron, but she did not come. Then the witch
cried: ‘Where are you?’ ‘Here, on the stairs, I am sweeping,’ answered
the first drop of blood. The old woman went out, but saw no one on the
stairs, and cried again: ‘Where are you?’ ‘Here in the kitchen, I am
warming myself,’ cried the second drop of blood. She went into the
kitchen, but found no one. Then she cried again: ‘Where are you?’ ‘Ah,
here in the bed, I am sleeping,’ cried the third drop of blood. She went
into the room to the bed. What did she see there? Her own child,
whose head she had cut off, bathed in her blood. The witch fell into
a passion, sprang to the window, and as she could look forth quite far
into the world, she perceived her stepdaughter hurrying away with her
sweetheart Roland. ‘That shall not help you,’ cried she, ‘even if you
have got a long way off, you shall still not escape me.’ She put on her
many-league boots, in which she covered an hour’s walk at every step,
and it was not long before she overtook them. The girl, however, when
she saw the old woman striding towards her, changed, with her magic
wand, her sweetheart Roland into a lake, and herself into a duck
swimming in the middle of it. The witch placed herself on the shore,
threw breadcrumbs in, and went to endless trouble to entice the duck;
but the duck did not let herself be enticed, and the old woman had to
go home at night as she had come. At this the girl and her sweetheart
Roland resumed their natural shapes again, and they walked on the whole
night until daybreak. Then the maiden changed herself into a beautiful
flower which stood in the midst of a briar hedge, and her sweetheart
Roland into a fiddler. It was not long before the witch came striding up
towards them, and said to the musician: ‘Dear musician, may I pluck that
beautiful flower for myself?’ ‘Oh, yes,’ he replied, ‘I will play to
you while you do it.’ As she was hastily creeping into the hedge and was
just going to pluck the flower, knowing perfectly well who the flower
was, he began to play, and whether she would or not, she was forced
to dance, for it was a magical dance. The faster he played, the more
violent springs was she forced to make, and the thorns tore her clothes
from her body, and pricked her and wounded her till she bled, and as he
did not stop, she had to dance till she lay dead on the ground.

As they were now set free, Roland said: ‘Now I will go to my father and
arrange for the wedding.’ ‘Then in the meantime I will stay here and
wait for you,’ said the girl, ‘and that no one may recognize me, I will
change myself into a red stone landmark.’ Then Roland went away, and the
girl stood like a red landmark in the field and waited for her beloved.
But when Roland got home, he fell into the snares of another, who so
fascinated him that he forgot the maiden. The poor girl remained there a
long time, but at length, as he did not return at all, she was sad, and
changed herself into a flower, and thought: ‘Someone will surely come
this way, and trample me down.’

It befell, however, that a shepherd kept his sheep in the field and saw
the flower, and as it was so pretty, plucked it, took it with him, and
laid it away in his chest. From that time forth, strange things happened
in the shepherd’s house. When he arose in the morning, all the work was
already done, the room was swept, the table and benches cleaned, the
fire in the hearth was lighted, and the water was fetched, and at noon,
when he came home, the table was laid, and a good dinner served. He
could not conceive how this came to pass, for he never saw a human being
in his house, and no one could have concealed himself in it. He was
certainly pleased with this good attendance, but still at last he was so
afraid that he went to a wise woman and asked for her advice. The wise
woman said: ‘There is some enchantment behind it, listen very early some
morning if anything is moving in the room, and if you see anything, no
matter what it is, throw a white cloth over it, and then the magic will
be stopped.’

The shepherd did as she bade him, and next morning just as day dawned,
he saw the chest open, and the flower come out. Swiftly he
sprang towards it, and threw a white cloth over it. Instantly the
transformation came to an end, and a beautiful girl stood before him,
who admitted to him that she had been the flower, and that up to this
time she had attended to his house-keeping. She told him her story,
and as she pleased him he asked her if she would marry him, but she
answered: ‘No,’ for she wanted to remain faithful to her sweetheart
Roland, although he had deserted her. Nevertheless, she promised not to
go away, but to continue keeping house for the shepherd.

And now the time drew near when Roland’s wedding was to be celebrated,
and then, according to an old custom in the country, it was announced
that all the girls were to be present at it, and sing in honour of the
bridal pair. When the faithful maiden heard of this, she grew so sad
that she thought her heart would break, and she would not go thither,
but the other girls came and took her. When it came to her turn to sing,
she stepped back, until at last she was the only one left, and then she
could not refuse. But when she began her song, and it reached Roland’s
ears, he sprang up and cried: ‘I know the voice, that is the true
bride, I will have no other!’ Everything he had forgotten, and which had
vanished from his mind, had suddenly come home again to his heart. Then
the faithful maiden held her wedding with her sweetheart Roland, and
grief came to an end and joy began.




SNOWDROP

It was the middle of winter, when the broad flakes of snow were falling
around, that the queen of a country many thousand miles off sat working
at her window. The frame of the window was made of fine black ebony, and
as she sat looking out upon the snow, she pricked her finger, and three
drops of blood fell upon it. Then she gazed thoughtfully upon the red
drops that sprinkled the white snow, and said, ‘Would that my little
daughter may be as white as that snow, as red as that blood, and as
black as this ebony windowframe!’ And so the little girl really did grow
up; her skin was as white as snow, her cheeks as rosy as the blood, and
her hair as black as ebony; and she was called Snowdrop.

But this queen died; and the king soon married another wife, who became
queen, and was very beautiful, but so vain that she could not bear
to think that anyone could be handsomer than she was. She had a fairy
looking-glass, to which she used to go, and then she would gaze upon
herself in it, and say:

‘Tell me, glass, tell me true!
Of all the ladies in the land,
Who is fairest, tell me, who?’

And the glass had always answered:

‘Thou, queen, art the fairest in all the land.’

But Snowdrop grew more and more beautiful; and when she was seven years
old she was as bright as the day, and fairer than the queen herself.
Then the glass one day answered the queen, when she went to look in it
as usual:

‘Thou, queen, art fair, and beauteous to see,
But Snowdrop is lovelier far than thee!’

When she heard this she turned pale with rage and envy, and called to
one of her servants, and said, ‘Take Snowdrop away into the wide wood,
that I may never see her any more.’ Then the servant led her away; but
his heart melted when Snowdrop begged him to spare her life, and he
said, ‘I will not hurt you, thou pretty child.’ So he left her by
herself; and though he thought it most likely that the wild beasts would
tear her in pieces, he felt as if a great weight were taken off his
heart when he had made up his mind not to kill her but to leave her to
her fate, with the chance of someone finding and saving her.

Then poor Snowdrop wandered along through the wood in great fear; and
the wild beasts roared about her, but none did her any harm. In the
evening she came to a cottage among the hills, and went in to rest, for
her little feet would carry her no further. Everything was spruce and
neat in the cottage: on the table was spread a white cloth, and there
were seven little plates, seven little loaves, and seven little glasses
with wine in them; and seven knives and forks laid in order; and by
the wall stood seven little beds. As she was very hungry, she picked
a little piece of each loaf and drank a very little wine out of each
glass; and after that she thought she would lie down and rest. So she
tried all the little beds; but one was too long, and another was too
short, till at last the seventh suited her: and there she laid herself
down and went to sleep.

By and by in came the masters of the cottage. Now they were seven little
dwarfs, that lived among the mountains, and dug and searched for gold.
They lighted up their seven lamps, and saw at once that all was not
right. The first said, ‘Who has been sitting on my stool?’ The second,
‘Who has been eating off my plate?’ The third, ‘Who has been picking my
bread?’ The fourth, ‘Who has been meddling with my spoon?’ The fifth,
‘Who has been handling my fork?’ The sixth, ‘Who has been cutting with
my knife?’ The seventh, ‘Who has been drinking my wine?’ Then the first
looked round and said, ‘Who has been lying on my bed?’ And the rest came
running to him, and everyone cried out that somebody had been upon his
bed. But the seventh saw Snowdrop, and called all his brethren to come
and see her; and they cried out with wonder and astonishment and brought
their lamps to look at her, and said, ‘Good heavens! what a lovely child
she is!’ And they were very glad to see her, and took care not to wake
her; and the seventh dwarf slept an hour with each of the other dwarfs
in turn, till the night was gone.

In the morning Snowdrop told them all her story; and they pitied her,
and said if she would keep all things in order, and cook and wash and
knit and spin for them, she might stay where she was, and they would
take good care of her. Then they went out all day long to their work,
seeking for gold and silver in the mountains: but Snowdrop was left at
home; and they warned her, and said, ‘The queen will soon find out where
you are, so take care and let no one in.’

But the queen, now that she thought Snowdrop was dead, believed that she
must be the handsomest lady in the land; and she went to her glass and
said:

‘Tell me, glass, tell me true!
Of all the ladies in the land,
Who is fairest, tell me, who?’

And the glass answered:

‘Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land:
But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,
Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,
There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she
Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.’

Then the queen was very much frightened; for she knew that the glass
always spoke the truth, and was sure that the servant had betrayed her.
And she could not bear to think that anyone lived who was more beautiful
than she was; so she dressed herself up as an old pedlar, and went
her way over the hills, to the place where the dwarfs dwelt. Then she
knocked at the door, and cried, ‘Fine wares to sell!’ Snowdrop looked
out at the window, and said, ‘Good day, good woman! what have you to
sell?’ ‘Good wares, fine wares,’ said she; ‘laces and bobbins of all
colours.’ ‘I will let the old lady in; she seems to be a very good
sort of body,’ thought Snowdrop, as she ran down and unbolted the door.
‘Bless me!’ said the old woman, ‘how badly your stays are laced! Let me
lace them up with one of my nice new laces.’ Snowdrop did not dream of
any mischief; so she stood before the old woman; but she set to work
so nimbly, and pulled the lace so tight, that Snowdrop’s breath was
stopped, and she fell down as if she were dead. ‘There’s an end to all
thy beauty,’ said the spiteful queen, and went away home.

In the evening the seven dwarfs came home; and I need not say how
grieved they were to see their faithful Snowdrop stretched out upon the
ground, as if she was quite dead. However, they lifted her up, and when
they found what ailed her, they cut the lace; and in a little time she
began to breathe, and very soon came to life again. Then they said, ‘The
old woman was the queen herself; take care another time, and let no one
in when we are away.’

When the queen got home, she went straight to her glass, and spoke to it
as before; but to her great grief it still said:

‘Thou, queen, art the fairest in all this land:
But over the hills, in the greenwood shade,
Where the seven dwarfs their dwelling have made,
There Snowdrop is hiding her head; and she
Is lovelier far, O queen! than thee.’

Then the blood ran cold in her heart with spite and malice, to see that
Snowdrop still lived; and she dressed herself up again, but in quite
another dress from the one she wore before, and took with her a poisoned
comb. When she reached the dwarfs’ cottage, she knocked at the door, and
cried, ‘Fine wares to sell!’ But Snowdrop said, ‘I dare not let anyone
in.’ Then the queen said, ‘Only look at my beautiful combs!’ and gave
her the poisoned one. And it looked so pretty, that she took it up and
put it into her hair to try it; but the moment it touched her head,
the poison was so powerful that she fell down senseless. ‘There you may
lie,’ said the queen, and went her way. But by good luck the dwarfs
came in very early that evening; and when they saw Snowdrop lying on
the ground, they thought what had happened, and soon found the poisoned
comb. And when they took it away she got well, and told them all that
had passed; and they warned her once more not to open the door to
anyone.

Meantime the queen went home to her glass, and shook with rage when she
read the very same answer as before; and she said, ‘Snowdrop shall die,
if it cost me my life.’ So she went by herself into her chamber, and got
ready a poisoned apple: the outside looked very rosy and tempting, but
whoever tasted it was sure to die. Then she dressed herself up as a
peasant’s wife, and travelled over the hills to the dwarfs’ cottage,
and knocked at the door; but Snowdrop put her head out of the window and
said, ‘I dare not let anyone in, for the dwarfs have told me not.’ ‘Do
as you please,’ said the old woman, ‘but at any rate take this pretty
apple; I will give it you.’ ‘No,’ said Snowdrop, ‘I dare not take it.’
‘You silly girl!’ answered the other, ‘what are you afraid of? Do you
think it is poisoned? Come! do you eat one part, and I will eat the
other.’ Now the apple was so made up that one side was good, though the
other side was poisoned. Then Snowdrop was much tempted to taste, for
the apple looked so very nice; and when she saw the old woman eat, she
could wait no longer. But she had scarcely put the piece into her mouth,
when she fell down dead upon the ground. ‘This time nothing will save
thee,’ said the queen; and she went home to her glass, and at last it
said:

‘Thou, queen, art the fairest of all the fair.’

And then her wicked heart was glad, and as happy as such a heart could
be.

When evening came, and the dwarfs had gone home, they found Snowdrop
lying on the ground: no breath came from her lips, and they were afraid
that she was quite dead. They lifted her up, and combed her hair, and
washed her face with wine and water; but all was in vain, for the little
girl seemed quite dead. So they laid her down upon a bier, and all seven
watched and bewailed her three whole days; and then they thought they
would bury her: but her cheeks were still rosy; and her face looked just
as it did while she was alive; so they said, ‘We will never bury her in
the cold ground.’ And they made a coffin of glass, so that they might
still look at her, and wrote upon it in golden letters what her name
was, and that she was a king’s daughter. And the coffin was set among
the hills, and one of the dwarfs always sat by it and watched. And the
birds of the air came too, and bemoaned Snowdrop; and first of all came
an owl, and then a raven, and at last a dove, and sat by her side.

And thus Snowdrop lay for a long, long time, and still only looked as
though she was asleep; for she was even now as white as snow, and as red
as blood, and as black as ebony. At last a prince came and called at the
dwarfs’ house; and he saw Snowdrop, and read what was written in golden
letters. Then he offered the dwarfs money, and prayed and besought them
to let him take her away; but they said, ‘We will not part with her for
all the gold in the world.’ At last, however, they had pity on him, and
gave him the coffin; but the moment he lifted it up to carry it home
with him, the piece of apple fell from between her lips, and Snowdrop
awoke, and said, ‘Where am I?’ And the prince said, ‘Thou art quite safe
with me.’

Then he told her all that had happened, and said, ‘I love you far better
than all the world; so come with me to my father’s palace, and you shall
be my wife.’ And Snowdrop consented, and went home with the prince;
and everything was got ready with great pomp and splendour for their
wedding.

To the feast was asked, among the rest, Snowdrop’s old enemy the queen;
and as she was dressing herself in fine rich clothes, she looked in the
glass and said:

‘Tell me, glass, tell me true!
Of all the ladies in the land,
Who is fairest, tell me, who?’

And the glass answered:

‘Thou, lady, art loveliest here, I ween;
But lovelier far is the new-made queen.’

When she heard this she started with rage; but her envy and curiosity
were so great, that she could not help setting out to see the bride. And
when she got there, and saw that it was no other than Snowdrop, who, as
she thought, had been dead a long while, she choked with rage, and fell
down and died: but Snowdrop and the prince lived and reigned happily
over that land many, many years; and sometimes they went up into the
mountains, and paid a visit to the little dwarfs, who had been so kind
to Snowdrop in her time of need.




THE PINK

There was once upon a time a queen to whom God had given no children.
Every morning she went into the garden and prayed to God in heaven to
bestow on her a son or a daughter. Then an angel from heaven came to her
and said: ‘Be at rest, you shall have a son with the power of wishing,
so that whatsoever in the world he wishes for, that shall he have.’ Then
she went to the king, and told him the joyful tidings, and when the time
was come she gave birth to a son, and the king was filled with gladness.

Every morning she went with the child to the garden where the wild
beasts were kept, and washed herself there in a clear stream. It
happened once when the child was a little older, that it was lying in
her arms and she fell asleep. Then came the old cook, who knew that the
child had the power of wishing, and stole it away, and he took a hen,
and cut it in pieces, and dropped some of its blood on the queen’s apron
and on her dress. Then he carried the child away to a secret place,
where a nurse was obliged to suckle it, and he ran to the king and
accused the queen of having allowed her child to be taken from her by
the wild beasts. When the king saw the blood on her apron, he believed
this, fell into such a passion that he ordered a high tower to be built,
in which neither sun nor moon could be seen and had his wife put into
it, and walled up. Here she was to stay for seven years without meat
or drink, and die of hunger. But God sent two angels from heaven in the
shape of white doves, which flew to her twice a day, and carried her
food until the seven years were over.

The cook, however, thought to himself: ‘If the child has the power of
wishing, and I am here, he might very easily get me into trouble.’ So
he left the palace and went to the boy, who was already big enough to
speak, and said to him: ‘Wish for a beautiful palace for yourself with
a garden, and all else that pertains to it.’ Scarcely were the words out
of the boy’s mouth, when everything was there that he had wished for.
After a while the cook said to him: ‘It is not well for you to be so
alone, wish for a pretty girl as a companion.’ Then the king’s son
wished for one, and she immediately stood before him, and was more
beautiful than any painter could have painted her. The two played
together, and loved each other with all their hearts, and the old cook
went out hunting like a nobleman. The thought occurred to him, however,
that the king’s son might some day wish to be with his father, and thus
bring him into great peril. So he went out and took the maiden aside,
and said: ‘Tonight when the boy is asleep, go to his bed and plunge this
knife into his heart, and bring me his heart and tongue, and if you do
not do it, you shall lose your life.’ Thereupon he went away, and when
he returned next day she had not done it, and said: ‘Why should I shed
the blood of an innocent boy who has never harmed anyone?’ The cook once
more said: ‘If you do not do it, it shall cost you your own life.’ When
he had gone away, she had a little hind brought to her, and ordered her
to be killed, and took her heart and tongue, and laid them on a plate,
and when she saw the old man coming, she said to the boy: ‘Lie down in
your bed, and draw the clothes over you.’ Then the wicked wretch came in
and said: ‘Where are the boy’s heart and tongue?’ The girl reached the
plate to him, but the king’s son threw off the quilt, and said: ‘You old
sinner, why did you want to kill me? Now will I pronounce thy sentence.
You shall become a black poodle and have a gold collar round your neck,
and shall eat burning coals, till the flames burst forth from your
throat.’ And when he had spoken these words, the old man was changed
into a poodle dog, and had a gold collar round his neck, and the cooks
were ordered to bring up some live coals, and these he ate, until the
flames broke forth from his throat. The king’s son remained there a
short while longer, and he thought of his mother, and wondered if she
were still alive. At length he said to the maiden: ‘I will go home to my
own country; if you will go with me, I will provide for you.’ ‘Ah,’
she replied, ‘the way is so long, and what shall I do in a strange land
where I am unknown?’ As she did not seem quite willing, and as they
could not be parted from each other, he wished that she might be changed
into a beautiful pink, and took her with him. Then he went away to his
own country, and the poodle had to run after him. He went to the tower
in which his mother was confined, and as it was so high, he wished for
a ladder which would reach up to the very top. Then he mounted up and
looked inside, and cried: ‘Beloved mother, Lady Queen, are you still
alive, or are you dead?’ She answered: ‘I have just eaten, and am still
satisfied,’ for she thought the angels were there. Said he: ‘I am your
dear son, whom the wild beasts were said to have torn from your arms;
but I am alive still, and will soon set you free.’ Then he descended
again, and went to his father, and caused himself to be announced as a
strange huntsman, and asked if he could offer him service. The king said
yes, if he was skilful and could get game for him, he should come to
him, but that deer had never taken up their quarters in any part of the
district or country. Then the huntsman promised to procure as much game
for him as he could possibly use at the royal table. So he summoned all
the huntsmen together, and bade them go out into the forest with him.
And he went with them and made them form a great circle, open at one end
where he stationed himself, and began to wish. Two hundred deer and more
came running inside the circle at once, and the huntsmen shot them.
Then they were all placed on sixty country carts, and driven home to the
king, and for once he was able to deck his table with game, after having
had none at all for years.

Now the king felt great joy at this, and commanded that his entire
household should eat with him next day, and made a great feast. When
they were all assembled together, he said to the huntsman: ‘As you are
so clever, you shall sit by me.’ He replied: ‘Lord King, your majesty
must excuse me, I am a poor huntsman.’ But the king insisted on it,
and said: ‘You shall sit by me,’ until he did it. Whilst he was sitting
there, he thought of his dearest mother, and wished that one of the
king’s principal servants would begin to speak of her, and would ask how
it was faring with the queen in the tower, and if she were alive still,
or had perished. Hardly had he formed the wish than the marshal began,
and said: ‘Your majesty, we live joyously here, but how is the queen
living in the tower? Is she still alive, or has she died?’ But the king
replied: ‘She let my dear son be torn to pieces by wild beasts; I will
not have her named.’ Then the huntsman arose and said: ‘Gracious lord
father she is alive still, and I am her son, and I was not carried away
by wild beasts, but by that wretch the old cook, who tore me from her
arms when she was asleep, and sprinkled her apron with the blood of a
chicken.’ Thereupon he took the dog with the golden collar, and said:
‘That is the wretch!’ and caused live coals to be brought, and these the
dog was compelled to devour before the sight of all, until flames burst
forth from its throat. On this the huntsman asked the king if he would
like to see the dog in his true shape, and wished him back into the form
of the cook, in the which he stood immediately, with his white apron,
and his knife by his side. When the king saw him he fell into a passion,
and ordered him to be cast into the deepest dungeon. Then the huntsman
spoke further and said: ‘Father, will you see the maiden who brought me
up so tenderly and who was afterwards to murder me, but did not do it,
though her own life depended on it?’ The king replied: ‘Yes, I would
like to see her.’ The son said: ‘Most gracious father, I will show her
to you in the form of a beautiful flower,’ and he thrust his hand into
his pocket and brought forth the pink, and placed it on the royal table,
and it was so beautiful that the king had never seen one to equal it.
Then the son said: ‘Now will I show her to you in her own form,’ and
wished that she might become a maiden, and she stood there looking so
beautiful that no painter could have made her look more so.

And the king sent two waiting-maids and two attendants into the tower,
to fetch the queen and bring her to the royal table. But when she was
led in she ate nothing, and said: ‘The gracious and merciful God who has
supported me in the tower, will soon set me free.’ She lived three days
more, and then died happily, and when she was buried, the two white
doves which had brought her food to the tower, and were angels of
heaven, followed her body and seated themselves on her grave. The aged
king ordered the cook to be torn in four pieces, but grief consumed the
king’s own heart, and he soon died. His son married the beautiful maiden
whom he had brought with him as a flower in his pocket, and whether they
are still alive or not, is known to God.




CLEVER ELSIE

There was once a man who had a daughter who was called Clever Elsie. And
when she had grown up her father said: ‘We will get her married.’ ‘Yes,’
said the mother, ‘if only someone would come who would have her.’ At
length a man came from a distance and wooed her, who was called Hans;
but he stipulated that Clever Elsie should be really smart. ‘Oh,’ said
the father, ‘she has plenty of good sense’; and the mother said: ‘Oh,
she can see the wind coming up the street, and hear the flies coughing.’
‘Well,’ said Hans, ‘if she is not really smart, I won’t have her.’ When
they were sitting at dinner and had eaten, the mother said: ‘Elsie, go
into the cellar and fetch some beer.’ Then Clever Elsie took the pitcher
from the wall, went into the cellar, and tapped the lid briskly as she
went, so that the time might not appear long. When she was below she
fetched herself a chair, and set it before the barrel so that she had
no need to stoop, and did not hurt her back or do herself any unexpected
injury. Then she placed the can before her, and turned the tap, and
while the beer was running she would not let her eyes be idle, but
looked up at the wall, and after much peering here and there, saw a
pick-axe exactly above her, which the masons had accidentally left
there.

Then Clever Elsie began to weep and said: ‘If I get Hans, and we have
a child, and he grows big, and we send him into the cellar here to draw
beer, then the pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.’ Then she
sat and wept and screamed with all the strength of her body, over the
misfortune which lay before her. Those upstairs waited for the drink,
but Clever Elsie still did not come. Then the woman said to the servant:
‘Just go down into the cellar and see where Elsie is.’ The maid went and
found her sitting in front of the barrel, screaming loudly. ‘Elsie why
do you weep?’ asked the maid. ‘Ah,’ she answered, ‘have I not reason to
weep? If I get Hans, and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to
draw beer here, the pick-axe will perhaps fall on his head, and kill
him.’ Then said the maid: ‘What a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down
beside her and began loudly to weep over the misfortune. After a while,
as the maid did not come back, and those upstairs were thirsty for the
beer, the man said to the boy: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see
where Elsie and the girl are.’ The boy went down, and there sat Clever
Elsie and the girl both weeping together. Then he asked: ‘Why are you
weeping?’ ‘Ah,’ said Elsie, ‘have I not reason to weep? If I get Hans,
and we have a child, and he grows big, and has to draw beer here, the
pick-axe will fall on his head and kill him.’ Then said the boy: ‘What
a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down by her, and likewise began to
howl loudly. Upstairs they waited for the boy, but as he still did not
return, the man said to the woman: ‘Just go down into the cellar and see
where Elsie is!’ The woman went down, and found all three in the midst
of their lamentations, and inquired what was the cause; then Elsie told
her also that her future child was to be killed by the pick-axe, when it
grew big and had to draw beer, and the pick-axe fell down. Then said the
mother likewise: ‘What a clever Elsie we have!’ and sat down and wept
with them. The man upstairs waited a short time, but as his wife did not
come back and his thirst grew ever greater, he said: ‘I must go into the
cellar myself and see where Elsie is.’ But when he got into the cellar,
and they were all sitting together crying, and he heard the reason, and
that Elsie’s child was the cause, and the Elsie might perhaps bring one
into the world some day, and that he might be killed by the pick-axe, if
he should happen to be sitting beneath it, drawing beer just at the very
time when it fell down, he cried: ‘Oh, what a clever Elsie!’ and sat
down, and likewise wept with them. The bridegroom stayed upstairs alone
for a long time; then as no one would come back he thought: ‘They must be
waiting for me below: I too must go there and see what they are about.’
When he got down, the five of them were sitting screaming and lamenting
quite piteously, each out-doing the other. ‘What misfortune has happened
then?’ asked he. ‘Ah, dear Hans,’ said Elsie, ‘if we marry each other
and have a child, and he is big, and we perhaps send him here to draw
something to drink, then the pick-axe which has been left up there might
dash his brains out if it were to fall down, so have we not reason to
weep?’ ‘Come,’ said Hans, ‘more understanding than that is not needed
for my household, as you are such a clever Elsie, I will have you,’ and
seized her hand, took her upstairs with him, and married her.

After Hans had had her some time, he said: ‘Wife, I am going out to work
and earn some money for us; go into the field and cut the corn that we
may have some bread.’ ‘Yes, dear Hans, I will do that.’ After Hans had
gone away, she cooked herself some good broth and took it into the field
with her. When she came to the field she said to herself: ‘What shall I
do; shall I cut first, or shall I eat first? Oh, I will eat first.’ Then
she drank her cup of broth and when she was fully satisfied, she once
more said: ‘What shall I do? Shall I cut first, or shall I sleep first?
I will sleep first.’ Then she lay down among the corn and fell asleep.
Hans had been at home for a long time, but Elsie did not come; then said
he: ‘What a clever Elsie I have; she is so industrious that she does not
even come home to eat.’ But when evening came and she still stayed away,
Hans went out to see what she had cut, but nothing was cut, and she
was lying among the corn asleep. Then Hans hastened home and brought
a fowler’s net with little bells and hung it round about her, and she
still went on sleeping. Then he ran home, shut the house-door, and sat
down in his chair and worked. At length, when it was quite dark, Clever
Elsie awoke and when she got up there was a jingling all round about
her, and the bells rang at each step which she took. Then she was
alarmed, and became uncertain whether she really was Clever Elsie or
not, and said: ‘Is it I, or is it not I?’ But she knew not what answer
to make to this, and stood for a time in doubt; at length she thought:
‘I will go home and ask if it be I, or if it be not I, they will be sure
to know.’ She ran to the door of her own house, but it was shut; then
she knocked at the window and cried: ‘Hans, is Elsie within?’ ‘Yes,’
answered Hans, ‘she is within.’ Hereupon she was terrified, and said:
‘Ah, heavens! Then it is not I,’ and went to another door; but when the
people heard the jingling of the bells they would not open it, and she
could get in nowhere. Then she ran out of the village, and no one has
seen her since.




THE MISER IN THE BUSH

A farmer had a faithful and diligent servant, who had worked hard for
him three years, without having been paid any wages. At last it came
into the man’s head that he would not go on thus without pay any longer;
so he went to his master, and said, ‘I have worked hard for you a long
time, I will trust to you to give me what I deserve to have for my
trouble.’ The farmer was a sad miser, and knew that his man was very
simple-hearted; so he took out threepence, and gave him for every year’s
service a penny. The poor fellow thought it was a great deal of money to
have, and said to himself, ‘Why should I work hard, and live here on bad
fare any longer? I can now travel into the wide world, and make myself
merry.’ With that he put his money into his purse, and set out, roaming
over hill and valley.

As he jogged along over the fields, singing and dancing, a little dwarf
met him, and asked him what made him so merry. ‘Why, what should make
me down-hearted?’ said he; ‘I am sound in health and rich in purse, what
should I care for? I have saved up my three years’ earnings and have it
all safe in my pocket.’ ‘How much may it come to?’ said the little man.
‘Full threepence,’ replied the countryman. ‘I wish you would give them
to me,’ said the other; ‘I am very poor.’ Then the man pitied him, and
gave him all he had; and the little dwarf said in return, ‘As you have
such a kind honest heart, I will grant you three wishes--one for every
penny; so choose whatever you like.’ Then the countryman rejoiced at
his good luck, and said, ‘I like many things better than money: first, I
will have a bow that will bring down everything I shoot at; secondly,
a fiddle that will set everyone dancing that hears me play upon it; and
thirdly, I should like that everyone should grant what I ask.’ The dwarf
said he should have his three wishes; so he gave him the bow and fiddle,
and went his way.

Our honest friend journeyed on his way too; and if he was merry before,
he was now ten times more so. He had not gone far before he met an old
miser: close by them stood a tree, and on the topmost twig sat a thrush
singing away most joyfully. ‘Oh, what a pretty bird!’ said the miser; ‘I
would give a great deal of money to have such a one.’ ‘If that’s all,’
said the countryman, ‘I will soon bring it down.’ Then he took up his
bow, and down fell the thrush into the bushes at the foot of the tree.
The miser crept into the bush to find it; but directly he had got into
the middle, his companion took up his fiddle and played away, and the
miser began to dance and spring about, capering higher and higher in
the air. The thorns soon began to tear his clothes till they all hung
in rags about him, and he himself was all scratched and wounded, so that
the blood ran down. ‘Oh, for heaven’s sake!’ cried the miser, ‘Master!
master! pray let the fiddle alone. What have I done to deserve this?’
‘Thou hast shaved many a poor soul close enough,’ said the other; ‘thou
art only meeting thy reward’: so he played up another tune. Then the
miser began to beg and promise, and offered money for his liberty; but
he did not come up to the musician’s price for some time, and he danced
him along brisker and brisker, and the miser bid higher and higher, till
at last he offered a round hundred of florins that he had in his purse,
and had just gained by cheating some poor fellow. When the countryman
saw so much money, he said, ‘I will agree to your proposal.’ So he took
the purse, put up his fiddle, and travelled on very pleased with his
bargain.

Meanwhile the miser crept out of the bush half-naked and in a piteous
plight, and began to ponder how he should take his revenge, and serve
his late companion some trick. At last he went to the judge, and
complained that a rascal had robbed him of his money, and beaten him
into the bargain; and that the fellow who did it carried a bow at his
back and a fiddle hung round his neck. Then the judge sent out his
officers to bring up the accused wherever they should find him; and he
was soon caught and brought up to be tried.

The miser began to tell his tale, and said he had been robbed of
his money. ‘No, you gave it me for playing a tune to you.’ said the
countryman; but the judge told him that was not likely, and cut the
matter short by ordering him off to the gallows.

So away he was taken; but as he stood on the steps he said, ‘My Lord
Judge, grant me one last request.’ ‘Anything but thy life,’ replied the
other. ‘No,’ said he, ‘I do not ask my life; only to let me play upon
my fiddle for the last time.’ The miser cried out, ‘Oh, no! no! for
heaven’s sake don’t listen to him! don’t listen to him!’ But the judge
said, ‘It is only this once, he will soon have done.’ The fact was, he
could not refuse the request, on account of the dwarf’s third gift.

Then the miser said, ‘Bind me fast, bind me fast, for pity’s sake.’ But
the countryman seized his fiddle, and struck up a tune, and at the first
note judge, clerks, and jailer were in motion; all began capering, and
no one could hold the miser. At the second note the hangman let his
prisoner go, and danced also, and by the time he had played the first
bar of the tune, all were dancing together--judge, court, and miser, and
all the people who had followed to look on. At first the thing was merry
and pleasant enough; but when it had gone on a while, and there seemed
to be no end of playing or dancing, they began to cry out, and beg him
to leave off; but he stopped not a whit the more for their entreaties,
till the judge not only gave him his life, but promised to return him
the hundred florins.

Then he called to the miser, and said, ‘Tell us now, you vagabond, where
you got that gold, or I shall play on for your amusement only,’ ‘I stole
it,’ said the miser in the presence of all the people; ‘I acknowledge
that I stole it, and that you earned it fairly.’ Then the countryman
stopped his fiddle, and left the miser to take his place at the gallows.




ASHPUTTEL

The wife of a rich man fell sick; and when she felt that her end drew
nigh, she called her only daughter to her bed-side, and said, ‘Always be
a good girl, and I will look down from heaven and watch over you.’ Soon
afterwards she shut her eyes and died, and was buried in the garden;
and the little girl went every day to her grave and wept, and was always
good and kind to all about her. And the snow fell and spread a beautiful
white covering over the grave; but by the time the spring came, and the
sun had melted it away again, her father had married another wife. This
new wife had two daughters of her own, that she brought home with her;
they were fair in face but foul at heart, and it was now a sorry time
for the poor little girl. ‘What does the good-for-nothing want in the
parlour?’ said they; ‘they who would eat bread should first earn it;
away with the kitchen-maid!’ Then they took away her fine clothes, and
gave her an old grey frock to put on, and laughed at her, and turned her
into the kitchen.

There she was forced to do hard work; to rise early before daylight, to
bring the water, to make the fire, to cook and to wash. Besides that,
the sisters plagued her in all sorts of ways, and laughed at her. In the
evening when she was tired, she had no bed to lie down on, but was made
to lie by the hearth among the ashes; and as this, of course, made her
always dusty and dirty, they called her Ashputtel.

It happened once that the father was going to the fair, and asked his
wife’s daughters what he should bring them. ‘Fine clothes,’ said the
first; ‘Pearls and diamonds,’ cried the second. ‘Now, child,’ said he
to his own daughter, ‘what will you have?’ ‘The first twig, dear
father, that brushes against your hat when you turn your face to come
homewards,’ said she. Then he bought for the first two the fine clothes
and pearls and diamonds they had asked for: and on his way home, as he
rode through a green copse, a hazel twig brushed against him, and almost
pushed off his hat: so he broke it off and brought it away; and when he
got home he gave it to his daughter. Then she took it, and went to
her mother’s grave and planted it there; and cried so much that it was
watered with her tears; and there it grew and became a fine tree. Three
times every day she went to it and cried; and soon a little bird came
and built its nest upon the tree, and talked with her, and watched over
her, and brought her whatever she wished for.

Now it happened that the king of that land held a feast, which was to
last three days; and out of those who came to it his son was to choose
a bride for himself. Ashputtel’s two sisters were asked to come; so they
called her up, and said, ‘Now, comb our hair, brush our shoes, and tie
our sashes for us, for we are going to dance at the king’s feast.’
Then she did as she was told; but when all was done she could not help
crying, for she thought to herself, she should so have liked to have
gone with them to the ball; and at last she begged her mother very hard
to let her go. ‘You, Ashputtel!’ said she; ‘you who have nothing to
wear, no clothes at all, and who cannot even dance--you want to go to
the ball? And when she kept on begging, she said at last, to get rid of
her, ‘I will throw this dishful of peas into the ash-heap, and if in
two hours’ time you have picked them all out, you shall go to the feast
too.’

Then she threw the peas down among the ashes, but the little maiden ran
out at the back door into the garden, and cried out:

‘Hither, hither, through the sky,
Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!
Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,
Hither, hither, haste away!
One and all come help me, quick!
Haste ye, haste ye!--pick, pick, pick!’

Then first came two white doves, flying in at the kitchen window; next
came two turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under
heaven, chirping and fluttering in: and they flew down into the ashes.
And the little doves stooped their heads down and set to work, pick,
pick, pick; and then the others began to pick, pick, pick: and among
them all they soon picked out all the good grain, and put it into a dish
but left the ashes. Long before the end of the hour the work was quite
done, and all flew out again at the windows.

Then Ashputtel brought the dish to her mother, overjoyed at the thought
that now she should go to the ball. But the mother said, ‘No, no! you
slut, you have no clothes, and cannot dance; you shall not go.’ And when
Ashputtel begged very hard to go, she said, ‘If you can in one hour’s
time pick two of those dishes of peas out of the ashes, you shall go
too.’ And thus she thought she should at least get rid of her. So she
shook two dishes of peas into the ashes.

But the little maiden went out into the garden at the back of the house,
and cried out as before:

‘Hither, hither, through the sky,
Turtle-doves and linnets, fly!
Blackbird, thrush, and chaffinch gay,
Hither, hither, haste away!
One and all come help me, quick!
Haste ye, haste ye!--pick, pick, pick!’

Then first came two white doves in at the kitchen window; next came two
turtle-doves; and after them came all the little birds under heaven,
chirping and hopping about. And they flew down into the ashes; and the
little doves put their heads down and set to work, pick, pick, pick; and
then the others began pick, pick, pick; and they put all the good grain
into the dishes, and left all the ashes. Before half an hour’s time all
was done, and out they flew again. And then Ashputtel took the dishes to
her mother, rejoicing to think that she should now go to the ball.
But her mother said, ‘It is all of no use, you cannot go; you have no
clothes, and cannot dance, and you would only put us to shame’: and off
she went with her two daughters to the ball.

Now when all were gone, and nobody left at home, Ashputtel went
sorrowfully and sat down under the hazel-tree, and cried out:

‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,
Gold and silver over me!’

Then her friend the bird flew out of the tree, and brought a gold and
silver dress for her, and slippers of spangled silk; and she put them
on, and followed her sisters to the feast. But they did not know her,
and thought it must be some strange princess, she looked so fine and
beautiful in her rich clothes; and they never once thought of Ashputtel,
taking it for granted that she was safe at home in the dirt.

The king’s son soon came up to her, and took her by the hand and danced
with her, and no one else: and he never left her hand; but when anyone
else came to ask her to dance, he said, ‘This lady is dancing with me.’

Thus they danced till a late hour of the night; and then she wanted to
go home: and the king’s son said, ‘I shall go and take care of you to
your home’; for he wanted to see where the beautiful maiden lived. But
she slipped away from him, unawares, and ran off towards home; and as
the prince followed her, she jumped up into the pigeon-house and shut
the door. Then he waited till her father came home, and told him that
the unknown maiden, who had been at the feast, had hid herself in the
pigeon-house. But when they had broken open the door they found no one
within; and as they came back into the house, Ashputtel was lying, as
she always did, in her dirty frock by the ashes, and her dim little
lamp was burning in the chimney. For she had run as quickly as she could
through the pigeon-house and on to the hazel-tree, and had there taken
off her beautiful clothes, and put them beneath the tree, that the bird
might carry them away, and had lain down again amid the ashes in her
little grey frock.

The next day when the feast was again held, and her father, mother, and
sisters were gone, Ashputtel went to the hazel-tree, and said:

‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,
Gold and silver over me!’

And the bird came and brought a still finer dress than the one she
had worn the day before. And when she came in it to the ball, everyone
wondered at her beauty: but the king’s son, who was waiting for her,
took her by the hand, and danced with her; and when anyone asked her to
dance, he said as before, ‘This lady is dancing with me.’

When night came she wanted to go home; and the king’s son followed here
as before, that he might see into what house she went: but she sprang
away from him all at once into the garden behind her father’s house.
In this garden stood a fine large pear-tree full of ripe fruit; and
Ashputtel, not knowing where to hide herself, jumped up into it without
being seen. Then the king’s son lost sight of her, and could not find
out where she was gone, but waited till her father came home, and said
to him, ‘The unknown lady who danced with me has slipped away, and I
think she must have sprung into the pear-tree.’ The father thought to
himself, ‘Can it be Ashputtel?’ So he had an axe brought; and they cut
down the tree, but found no one upon it. And when they came back into
the kitchen, there lay Ashputtel among the ashes; for she had slipped
down on the other side of the tree, and carried her beautiful clothes
back to the bird at the hazel-tree, and then put on her little grey
frock.

The third day, when her father and mother and sisters were gone, she
went again into the garden, and said:

‘Shake, shake, hazel-tree,
Gold and silver over me!’

Then her kind friend the bird brought a dress still finer than the
former one, and slippers which were all of gold: so that when she came
to the feast no one knew what to say, for wonder at her beauty: and the
king’s son danced with nobody but her; and when anyone else asked her to
dance, he said, ‘This lady is _my_ partner, sir.’

When night came she wanted to go home; and the king’s son would go with
her, and said to himself, ‘I will not lose her this time’; but, however,
she again slipped away from him, though in such a hurry that she dropped
her left golden slipper upon the stairs.

The prince took the shoe, and went the next day to the king his father,
and said, ‘I will take for my wife the lady that this golden slipper
fits.’ Then both the sisters were overjoyed to hear it; for they
had beautiful feet, and had no doubt that they could wear the golden
slipper. The eldest went first into the room where the slipper was, and
wanted to try it on, and the mother stood by. But her great toe could
not go into it, and the shoe was altogether much too small for her. Then
the mother gave her a knife, and said, ‘Never mind, cut it off; when you
are queen you will not care about toes; you will not want to walk.’ So
the silly girl cut off her great toe, and thus squeezed on the shoe,
and went to the king’s son. Then he took her for his bride, and set her
beside him on his horse, and rode away with her homewards.

But on their way home they had to pass by the hazel-tree that Ashputtel
had planted; and on the branch sat a little dove singing:

‘Back again! back again! look to the shoe!
The shoe is too small, and not made for you!
Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,
For she’s not the true one that sits by thy side.’

Then the prince got down and looked at her foot; and he saw, by the
blood that streamed from it, what a trick she had played him. So he
turned his horse round, and brought the false bride back to her home,
and said, ‘This is not the right bride; let the other sister try and put
on the slipper.’ Then she went into the room and got her foot into the
shoe, all but the heel, which was too large. But her mother squeezed it
in till the blood came, and took her to the king’s son: and he set her
as his bride by his side on his horse, and rode away with her.

But when they came to the hazel-tree the little dove sat there still,
and sang:

‘Back again! back again! look to the shoe!
The shoe is too small, and not made for you!
Prince! prince! look again for thy bride,
For she’s not the true one that sits by thy side.’

Then he looked down, and saw that the blood streamed so much from the
shoe, that her white stockings were quite red. So he turned his horse
and brought her also back again. ‘This is not the true bride,’ said he
to the father; ‘have you no other daughters?’ ‘No,’ said he; ‘there is
only a little dirty Ashputtel here, the child of my first wife; I am
sure she cannot be the bride.’ The prince told him to send her. But the
mother said, ‘No, no, she is much too dirty; she will not dare to show
herself.’ However, the prince would have her come; and she first washed
her face and hands, and then went in and curtsied to him, and he reached
her the golden slipper. Then she took her clumsy shoe off her left foot,
and put on the golden slipper; and it fitted her as if it had been made
for her. And when he drew near and looked at her face he knew her, and
said, ‘This is the right bride.’ But the mother and both the sisters
were frightened, and turned pale with anger as he took Ashputtel on his
horse, and rode away with her. And when they came to the hazel-tree, the
white dove sang:

‘Home! home! look at the shoe!
Princess! the shoe was made for you!
Prince! prince! take home thy bride,
For she is the true one that sits by thy side!’

And when the dove had done its song, it came flying, and perched upon
her right shoulder, and so went home with her.




THE WHITE SNAKE

A long time ago there lived a king who was famed for his wisdom through
all the land. Nothing was hidden from him, and it seemed as if news of
the most secret things was brought to him through the air. But he had a
strange custom; every day after dinner, when the table was cleared,
and no one else was present, a trusty servant had to bring him one more
dish. It was covered, however, and even the servant did not know what
was in it, neither did anyone know, for the king never took off the
cover to eat of it until he was quite alone.

This had gone on for a long time, when one day the servant, who took
away the dish, was overcome with such curiosity that he could not help
carrying the dish into his room. When he had carefully locked the door,
he lifted up the cover, and saw a white snake lying on the dish. But
when he saw it he could not deny himself the pleasure of tasting it,
so he cut of a little bit and put it into his mouth. No sooner had it
touched his tongue than he heard a strange whispering of little voices
outside his window. He went and listened, and then noticed that it was
the sparrows who were chattering together, and telling one another of
all kinds of things which they had seen in the fields and woods. Eating
the snake had given him power of understanding the language of animals.

Now it so happened that on this very day the queen lost her most
beautiful ring, and suspicion of having stolen it fell upon this trusty
servant, who was allowed to go everywhere. The king ordered the man to
be brought before him, and threatened with angry words that unless he
could before the morrow point out the thief, he himself should be looked
upon as guilty and executed. In vain he declared his innocence; he was
dismissed with no better answer.

In his trouble and fear he went down into the courtyard and took thought
how to help himself out of his trouble. Now some ducks were sitting
together quietly by a brook and taking their rest; and, whilst they
were making their feathers smooth with their bills, they were having a
confidential conversation together. The servant stood by and listened.
They were telling one another of all the places where they had been
waddling about all the morning, and what good food they had found; and
one said in a pitiful tone: ‘Something lies heavy on my stomach; as
I was eating in haste I swallowed a ring which lay under the queen’s
window.’ The servant at once seized her by the neck, carried her to the
kitchen, and said to the cook: ‘Here is a fine duck; pray, kill her.’
‘Yes,’ said the cook, and weighed her in his hand; ‘she has spared
no trouble to fatten herself, and has been waiting to be roasted long
enough.’ So he cut off her head, and as she was being dressed for the
spit, the queen’s ring was found inside her.

The servant could now easily prove his innocence; and the king, to make
amends for the wrong, allowed him to ask a favour, and promised him
the best place in the court that he could wish for. The servant refused
everything, and only asked for a horse and some money for travelling, as
he had a mind to see the world and go about a little. When his request
was granted he set out on his way, and one day came to a pond, where he
saw three fishes caught in the reeds and gasping for water. Now, though
it is said that fishes are dumb, he heard them lamenting that they must
perish so miserably, and, as he had a kind heart, he got off his
horse and put the three prisoners back into the water. They leapt with
delight, put out their heads, and cried to him: ‘We will remember you
and repay you for saving us!’

He rode on, and after a while it seemed to him that he heard a voice in
the sand at his feet. He listened, and heard an ant-king complain: ‘Why
cannot folks, with their clumsy beasts, keep off our bodies? That stupid
horse, with his heavy hoofs, has been treading down my people without
mercy!’ So he turned on to a side path and the ant-king cried out to
him: ‘We will remember you--one good turn deserves another!’

The path led him into a wood, and there he saw two old ravens standing
by their nest, and throwing out their young ones. ‘Out with you, you
idle, good-for-nothing creatures!’ cried they; ‘we cannot find food for
you any longer; you are big enough, and can provide for yourselves.’
But the poor young ravens lay upon the ground, flapping their wings, and
crying: ‘Oh, what helpless chicks we are! We must shift for ourselves,
and yet we cannot fly! What can we do, but lie here and starve?’ So the
good young fellow alighted and killed his horse with his sword, and gave
it to them for food. Then they came hopping up to it, satisfied their
hunger, and cried: ‘We will remember you--one good turn deserves
another!’

And now he had to use his own legs, and when he had walked a long
way, he came to a large city. There was a great noise and crowd in
the streets, and a man rode up on horseback, crying aloud: ‘The king’s
daughter wants a husband; but whoever seeks her hand must perform a hard
task, and if he does not succeed he will forfeit his life.’ Many had
already made the attempt, but in vain; nevertheless when the youth
saw the king’s daughter he was so overcome by her great beauty that he
forgot all danger, went before the king, and declared himself a suitor.

So he was led out to the sea, and a gold ring was thrown into it, before
his eyes; then the king ordered him to fetch this ring up from the
bottom of the sea, and added: ‘If you come up again without it you will
be thrown in again and again until you perish amid the waves.’ All the
people grieved for the handsome youth; then they went away, leaving him
alone by the sea.

He stood on the shore and considered what he should do, when suddenly
he saw three fishes come swimming towards him, and they were the very
fishes whose lives he had saved. The one in the middle held a mussel in
its mouth, which it laid on the shore at the youth’s feet, and when he
had taken it up and opened it, there lay the gold ring in the shell.
Full of joy he took it to the king and expected that he would grant him
the promised reward.

But when the proud princess perceived that he was not her equal in
birth, she scorned him, and required him first to perform another
task. She went down into the garden and strewed with her own hands ten
sacksful of millet-seed on the grass; then she said: ‘Tomorrow morning
before sunrise these must be picked up, and not a single grain be
wanting.’

The youth sat down in the garden and considered how it might be possible
to perform this task, but he could think of nothing, and there he sat
sorrowfully awaiting the break of day, when he should be led to death.
But as soon as the first rays of the sun shone into the garden he saw
all the ten sacks standing side by side, quite full, and not a single
grain was missing. The ant-king had come in the night with thousands
and thousands of ants, and the grateful creatures had by great industry
picked up all the millet-seed and gathered them into the sacks.

Presently the king’s daughter herself came down into the garden, and was
amazed to see that the young man had done the task she had given him.
But she could not yet conquer her proud heart, and said: ‘Although he
has performed both the tasks, he shall not be my husband until he had
brought me an apple from the Tree of Life.’ The youth did not know where
the Tree of Life stood, but he set out, and would have gone on for ever,
as long as his legs would carry him, though he had no hope of finding
it. After he had wandered through three kingdoms, he came one evening to
a wood, and lay down under a tree to sleep. But he heard a rustling in
the branches, and a golden apple fell into his hand. At the same time
three ravens flew down to him, perched themselves upon his knee, and
said: ‘We are the three young ravens whom you saved from starving; when
we had grown big, and heard that you were seeking the Golden Apple,
we flew over the sea to the end of the world, where the Tree of Life
stands, and have brought you the apple.’ The youth, full of joy, set out
homewards, and took the Golden Apple to the king’s beautiful daughter,
who had now no more excuses left to make. They cut the Apple of Life in
two and ate it together; and then her heart became full of love for him,
and they lived in undisturbed happiness to a great age.




THE WOLF AND THE SEVEN LITTLE KIDS

There was once upon a time an old goat who had seven little kids, and
loved them with all the love of a mother for her children. One day she
wanted to go into the forest and fetch some food. So she called all
seven to her and said: ‘Dear children, I have to go into the forest,
be on your guard against the wolf; if he comes in, he will devour you
all--skin, hair, and everything. The wretch often disguises himself, but
you will know him at once by his rough voice and his black feet.’ The
kids said: ‘Dear mother, we will take good care of ourselves; you may go
away without any anxiety.’ Then the old one bleated, and went on her way
with an easy mind.

It was not long before someone knocked at the house-door and called:
‘Open the door, dear children; your mother is here, and has brought
something back with her for each of you.’ But the little kids knew that
it was the wolf, by the rough voice. ‘We will not open the door,’ cried
they, ‘you are not our mother. She has a soft, pleasant voice, but
your voice is rough; you are the wolf!’ Then the wolf went away to a
shopkeeper and bought himself a great lump of chalk, ate this and made
his voice soft with it. Then he came back, knocked at the door of the
house, and called: ‘Open the door, dear children, your mother is here
and has brought something back with her for each of you.’ But the wolf
had laid his black paws against the window, and the children saw them
and cried: ‘We will not open the door, our mother has not black feet
like you: you are the wolf!’ Then the wolf ran to a baker and said: ‘I
have hurt my feet, rub some dough over them for me.’ And when the baker
had rubbed his feet over, he ran to the miller and said: ‘Strew some
white meal over my feet for me.’ The miller thought to himself: ‘The
wolf wants to deceive someone,’ and refused; but the wolf said: ‘If you
will not do it, I will devour you.’ Then the miller was afraid, and made
his paws white for him. Truly, this is the way of mankind.

So now the wretch went for the third time to the house-door, knocked at
it and said: ‘Open the door for me, children, your dear little mother
has come home, and has brought every one of you something back from the
forest with her.’ The little kids cried: ‘First show us your paws that
we may know if you are our dear little mother.’ Then he put his paws
in through the window and when the kids saw that they were white, they
believed that all he said was true, and opened the door. But who should
come in but the wolf! They were terrified and wanted to hide themselves.
One sprang under the table, the second into the bed, the third into the
stove, the fourth into the kitchen, the fifth into the cupboard, the
sixth under the washing-bowl, and the seventh into the clock-case. But
the wolf found them all, and used no great ceremony; one after the
other he swallowed them down his throat. The youngest, who was in
the clock-case, was the only one he did not find. When the wolf had
satisfied his appetite he took himself off, laid himself down under a
tree in the green meadow outside, and began to sleep. Soon afterwards
the old goat came home again from the forest. Ah! what a sight she saw
there! The house-door stood wide open. The table, chairs, and benches
were thrown down, the washing-bowl lay broken to pieces, and the quilts
and pillows were pulled off the bed. She sought her children, but they
were nowhere to be found. She called them one after another by name, but
no one answered. At last, when she came to the youngest, a soft voice
cried: ‘Dear mother, I am in the clock-case.’ She took the kid out, and
it told her that the wolf had come and had eaten all the others. Then
you may imagine how she wept over her poor children.

At length in her grief she went out, and the youngest kid ran with her.
When they came to the meadow, there lay the wolf by the tree and snored
so loud that the branches shook. She looked at him on every side and
saw that something was moving and struggling in his gorged belly. ‘Ah,
heavens,’ she said, ‘is it possible that my poor children whom he has
swallowed down for his supper, can be still alive?’ Then the kid had to
run home and fetch scissors, and a needle and thread, and the goat cut
open the monster’s stomach, and hardly had she made one cut, than one
little kid thrust its head out, and when she had cut farther, all six
sprang out one after another, and were all still alive, and had suffered
no injury whatever, for in his greediness the monster had swallowed them
down whole. What rejoicing there was! They embraced their dear mother,
and jumped like a tailor at his wedding. The mother, however, said: ‘Now
go and look for some big stones, and we will fill the wicked beast’s
stomach with them while he is still asleep.’ Then the seven kids dragged
the stones thither with all speed, and put as many of them into this
stomach as they could get in; and the mother sewed him up again in the
greatest haste, so that he was not aware of anything and never once
stirred.

When the wolf at length had had his fill of sleep, he got on his legs,
and as the stones in his stomach made him very thirsty, he wanted to
go to a well to drink. But when he began to walk and to move about, the
stones in his stomach knocked against each other and rattled. Then cried
he:

‘What rumbles and tumbles
Against my poor bones?
I thought ‘twas six kids,
But it feels like big stones.’

And when he got to the well and stooped over the water to drink, the
heavy stones made him fall in, and he drowned miserably. When the seven
kids saw that, they came running to the spot and cried aloud: ‘The wolf
is dead! The wolf is dead!’ and danced for joy round about the well with
their mother.




THE QUEEN BEE

Two kings’ sons once upon a time went into the world to seek their
fortunes; but they soon fell into a wasteful foolish way of living, so
that they could not return home again. Then their brother, who was a
little insignificant dwarf, went out to seek for his brothers: but when
he had found them they only laughed at him, to think that he, who was so
young and simple, should try to travel through the world, when they, who
were so much wiser, had been unable to get on. However, they all set
out on their journey together, and came at last to an ant-hill. The two
elder brothers would have pulled it down, in order to see how the poor
ants in their fright would run about and carry off their eggs. But the
little dwarf said, ‘Let the poor things enjoy themselves, I will not
suffer you to trouble them.’

So on they went, and came to a lake where many many ducks were swimming
about. The two brothers wanted to catch two, and roast them. But the
dwarf said, ‘Let the poor things enjoy themselves, you shall not kill
them.’ Next they came to a bees’-nest in a hollow tree, and there was
so much honey that it ran down the trunk; and the two brothers wanted to
light a fire under the tree and kill the bees, so as to get their honey.
But the dwarf held them back, and said, ‘Let the pretty insects enjoy
themselves, I cannot let you burn them.’

At length the three brothers came to a castle: and as they passed by the
stables they saw fine horses standing there, but all were of marble, and
no man was to be seen. Then they went through all the rooms, till they
came to a door on which were three locks: but in the middle of the door
was a wicket, so that they could look into the next room. There they saw
a little grey old man sitting at a table; and they called to him once or
twice, but he did not hear: however, they called a third time, and then
he rose and came out to them.

He said nothing, but took hold of them and led them to a beautiful
table covered with all sorts of good things: and when they had eaten and
drunk, he showed each of them to a bed-chamber.

The next morning he came to the eldest and took him to a marble table,
where there were three tablets, containing an account of the means by
which the castle might be disenchanted. The first tablet said: ‘In the
wood, under the moss, lie the thousand pearls belonging to the king’s
daughter; they must all be found: and if one be missing by set of sun,
he who seeks them will be turned into marble.’

The eldest brother set out, and sought for the pearls the whole day:
but the evening came, and he had not found the first hundred: so he was
turned into stone as the tablet had foretold.

The next day the second brother undertook the task; but he succeeded no
better than the first; for he could only find the second hundred of the
pearls; and therefore he too was turned into stone.

At last came the little dwarf’s turn; and he looked in the moss; but it
was so hard to find the pearls, and the job was so tiresome!--so he sat
down upon a stone and cried. And as he sat there, the king of the ants
(whose life he had saved) came to help him, with five thousand ants; and
it was not long before they had found all the pearls and laid them in a
heap.

The second tablet said: ‘The key of the princess’s bed-chamber must be
fished up out of the lake.’ And as the dwarf came to the brink of it,
he saw the two ducks whose lives he had saved swimming about; and they
dived down and soon brought in the key from the bottom.

The third task was the hardest. It was to choose out the youngest and
the best of the king’s three daughters. Now they were all beautiful, and
all exactly alike: but he was told that the eldest had eaten a piece of
sugar, the next some sweet syrup, and the youngest a spoonful of honey;
so he was to guess which it was that had eaten the honey.

Then came the queen of the bees, who had been saved by the little dwarf
from the fire, and she tried the lips of all three; but at last she sat
upon the lips of the one that had eaten the honey: and so the dwarf knew
which was the youngest. Thus the spell was broken, and all who had been
turned into stones awoke, and took their proper forms. And the dwarf
married the youngest and the best of the princesses, and was king after
her father’s death; but his two brothers married the other two sisters.




THE ELVES AND THE SHOEMAKER

There was once a shoemaker, who worked very hard and was very honest:
but still he could not earn enough to live upon; and at last all he
had in the world was gone, save just leather enough to make one pair of
shoes.

Then he cut his leather out, all ready to make up the next day, meaning
to rise early in the morning to his work. His conscience was clear and
his heart light amidst all his troubles; so he went peaceably to bed,
left all his cares to Heaven, and soon fell asleep. In the morning after
he had said his prayers, he sat himself down to his work; when, to his
great wonder, there stood the shoes all ready made, upon the table. The
good man knew not what to say or think at such an odd thing happening.
He looked at the workmanship; there was not one false stitch in the
whole job; all was so neat and true, that it was quite a masterpiece.

The same day a customer came in, and the shoes suited him so well that
he willingly paid a price higher than usual for them; and the poor
shoemaker, with the money, bought leather enough to make two pairs more.
In the evening he cut out the work, and went to bed early, that he might
get up and begin betimes next day; but he was saved all the trouble, for
when he got up in the morning the work was done ready to his hand. Soon
in came buyers, who paid him handsomely for his goods, so that he bought
leather enough for four pair more. He cut out the work again overnight
and found it done in the morning, as before; and so it went on for some
time: what was got ready in the evening was always done by daybreak, and
the good man soon became thriving and well off again.

One evening, about Christmas-time, as he and his wife were sitting over
the fire chatting together, he said to her, ‘I should like to sit up and
watch tonight, that we may see who it is that comes and does my work for
me.’ The wife liked the thought; so they left a light burning, and hid
themselves in a corner of the room, behind a curtain that was hung up
there, and watched what would happen.

As soon as it was midnight, there came in two little naked dwarfs; and
they sat themselves upon the shoemaker’s bench, took up all the work
that was cut out, and began to ply with their little fingers, stitching
and rapping and tapping away at such a rate, that the shoemaker was all
wonder, and could not take his eyes off them. And on they went, till the
job was quite done, and the shoes stood ready for use upon the table.
This was long before daybreak; and then they bustled away as quick as
lightning.

The next day the wife said to the shoemaker. ‘These little wights have
made us rich, and we ought to be thankful to them, and do them a good
turn if we can. I am quite sorry to see them run about as they do; and
indeed it is not very decent, for they have nothing upon their backs to
keep off the cold. I’ll tell you what, I will make each of them a shirt,
and a coat and waistcoat, and a pair of pantaloons into the bargain; and
do you make each of them a little pair of shoes.’

The thought pleased the good cobbler very much; and one evening, when
all the things were ready, they laid them on the table, instead of the
work that they used to cut out, and then went and hid themselves, to
watch what the little elves would do.

About midnight in they came, dancing and skipping, hopped round the
room, and then went to sit down to their work as usual; but when they
saw the clothes lying for them, they laughed and chuckled, and seemed
mightily delighted.

Then they dressed themselves in the twinkling of an eye, and danced and
capered and sprang about, as merry as could be; till at last they danced
out at the door, and away over the green.

The good couple saw them no more; but everything went well with them
from that time forward, as long as they lived.




THE JUNIPER-TREE

Long, long ago, some two thousand years or so, there lived a rich
man with a good and beautiful wife. They loved each other dearly, but
sorrowed much that they had no children. So greatly did they desire
to have one, that the wife prayed for it day and night, but still they
remained childless.

In front of the house there was a court, in which grew a juniper-tree.
One winter’s day the wife stood under the tree to peel some apples, and
as she was peeling them, she cut her finger, and the blood fell on the
snow. ‘Ah,’ sighed the woman heavily, ‘if I had but a child, as red as
blood and as white as snow,’ and as she spoke the words, her heart grew
light within her, and it seemed to her that her wish was granted, and
she returned to the house feeling glad and comforted. A month passed,
and the snow had all disappeared; then another month went by, and all
the earth was green. So the months followed one another, and first the
trees budded in the woods, and soon the green branches grew thickly
intertwined, and then the blossoms began to fall. Once again the wife
stood under the juniper-tree, and it was so full of sweet scent that her
heart leaped for joy, and she was so overcome with her happiness, that
she fell on her knees. Presently the fruit became round and firm, and
she was glad and at peace; but when they were fully ripe she picked the
berries and ate eagerly of them, and then she grew sad and ill. A little
while later she called her husband, and said to him, weeping. ‘If I
die, bury me under the juniper-tree.’ Then she felt comforted and happy
again, and before another month had passed she had a little child, and
when she saw that it was as white as snow and as red as blood, her joy
was so great that she died.

Her husband buried her under the juniper-tree, and wept bitterly for
her. By degrees, however, his sorrow grew less, and although at times he
still grieved over his loss, he was able to go about as usual, and later
on he married again.

He now had a little daughter born to him; the child of his first wife
was a boy, who was as red as blood and as white as snow. The mother
loved her daughter very much, and when she looked at her and then looked
at the boy, it pierced her heart to think that he would always stand in
the way of her own child, and she was continually thinking how she could
get the whole of the property for her. This evil thought took possession
of her more and more, and made her behave very unkindly to the boy. She
drove him from place to place with cuffings and buffetings, so that the
poor child went about in fear, and had no peace from the time he left
school to the time he went back.

One day the little daughter came running to her mother in the
store-room, and said, ‘Mother, give me an apple.’ ‘Yes, my child,’ said
the wife, and she gave her a beautiful apple out of the chest; the chest
had a very heavy lid and a large iron lock.

‘Mother,’ said the little daughter again, ‘may not brother have one
too?’ The mother was angry at this, but she answered, ‘Yes, when he
comes out of school.’

Just then she looked out of the window and saw him coming, and it seemed
as if an evil spirit entered into her, for she snatched the apple out
of her little daughter’s hand, and said, ‘You shall not have one before
your brother.’ She threw the apple into the chest and shut it to. The
little boy now came in, and the evil spirit in the wife made her say
kindly to him, ‘My son, will you have an apple?’ but she gave him a
wicked look. ‘Mother,’ said the boy, ‘how dreadful you look! Yes, give
me an apple.’ The thought came to her that she would kill him. ‘Come
with me,’ she said, and she lifted up the lid of the chest; ‘take one
out for yourself.’ And as he bent over to do so, the evil spirit urged
her, and crash! down went the lid, and off went the little boy’s head.
Then she was overwhelmed with fear at the thought of what she had done.
‘If only I can prevent anyone knowing that I did it,’ she thought. So
she went upstairs to her room, and took a white handkerchief out of
her top drawer; then she set the boy’s head again on his shoulders, and
bound it with the handkerchief so that nothing could be seen, and placed
him on a chair by the door with an apple in his hand.

Soon after this, little Marleen came up to her mother who was stirring
a pot of boiling water over the fire, and said, ‘Mother, brother is
sitting by the door with an apple in his hand, and he looks so pale;
and when I asked him to give me the apple, he did not answer, and that
frightened me.’

‘Go to him again,’ said her mother, ‘and if he does not answer, give him
a box on the ear.’ So little Marleen went, and said, ‘Brother, give me
that apple,’ but he did not say a word; then she gave him a box on the
ear, and his head rolled off. She was so terrified at this, that she ran
crying and screaming to her mother. ‘Oh!’ she said, ‘I have knocked off
brother’s head,’ and then she wept and wept, and nothing would stop her.

‘What have you done!’ said her mother, ‘but no one must know about it,
so you must keep silence; what is done can’t be undone; we will make
him into puddings.’ And she took the little boy and cut him up, made him
into puddings, and put him in the pot. But Marleen stood looking on,
and wept and wept, and her tears fell into the pot, so that there was no
need of salt.

Presently the father came home and sat down to his dinner; he asked,
‘Where is my son?’ The mother said nothing, but gave him a large dish of
black pudding, and Marleen still wept without ceasing.

The father again asked, ‘Where is my son?’

‘Oh,’ answered the wife, ‘he is gone into the country to his mother’s
great uncle; he is going to stay there some time.’

‘What has he gone there for, and he never even said goodbye to me!’

‘Well, he likes being there, and he told me he should be away quite six
weeks; he is well looked after there.’

‘I feel very unhappy about it,’ said the husband, ‘in case it should not
be all right, and he ought to have said goodbye to me.’

With this he went on with his dinner, and said, ‘Little Marleen, why do
you weep? Brother will soon be back.’ Then he asked his wife for more
pudding, and as he ate, he threw the bones under the table.

Little Marleen went upstairs and took her best silk handkerchief out of
her bottom drawer, and in it she wrapped all the bones from under the
table and carried them outside, and all the time she did nothing but
weep. Then she laid them in the green grass under the juniper-tree, and
she had no sooner done so, then all her sadness seemed to leave her,
and she wept no more. And now the juniper-tree began to move, and the
branches waved backwards and forwards, first away from one another, and
then together again, as it might be someone clapping their hands for
joy. After this a mist came round the tree, and in the midst of it there
was a burning as of fire, and out of the fire there flew a beautiful
bird, that rose high into the air, singing magnificently, and when it
could no more be seen, the juniper-tree stood there as before, and the
silk handkerchief and the bones were gone.

Little Marleen now felt as lighthearted and happy as if her brother were
still alive, and she went back to the house and sat down cheerfully to
the table and ate.

The bird flew away and alighted on the house of a goldsmith and began to
sing:

‘My mother killed her little son;
My father grieved when I was gone;
My sister loved me best of all;
She laid her kerchief over me,
And took my bones that they might lie
Underneath the juniper-tree
Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’

The goldsmith was in his workshop making a gold chain, when he heard the
song of the bird on his roof. He thought it so beautiful that he got
up and ran out, and as he crossed the threshold he lost one of his
slippers. But he ran on into the middle of the street, with a slipper on
one foot and a sock on the other; he still had on his apron, and still
held the gold chain and the pincers in his hands, and so he stood gazing
up at the bird, while the sun came shining brightly down on the street.

‘Bird,’ he said, ‘how beautifully you sing! Sing me that song again.’

‘Nay,’ said the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing. Give that gold
chain, and I will sing it you again.’

‘Here is the chain, take it,’ said the goldsmith. ‘Only sing me that
again.’

The bird flew down and took the gold chain in his right claw, and then
he alighted again in front of the goldsmith and sang:

‘My mother killed her little son;
My father grieved when I was gone;
My sister loved me best of all;
She laid her kerchief over me,
And took my bones that they might lie
Underneath the juniper-tree
Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’

Then he flew away, and settled on the roof of a shoemaker’s house and
sang:

‘My mother killed her little son;
My father grieved when I was gone;
My sister loved me best of all;
She laid her kerchief over me,
And took my bones that they might lie
Underneath the juniper-tree
Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’

The shoemaker heard him, and he jumped up and ran out in his
shirt-sleeves, and stood looking up at the bird on the roof with his
hand over his eyes to keep himself from being blinded by the sun.

‘Bird,’ he said, ‘how beautifully you sing!’ Then he called through the
door to his wife: ‘Wife, come out; here is a bird, come and look at it
and hear how beautifully it sings.’ Then he called his daughter and the
children, then the apprentices, girls and boys, and they all ran up the
street to look at the bird, and saw how splendid it was with its red
and green feathers, and its neck like burnished gold, and eyes like two
bright stars in its head.

‘Bird,’ said the shoemaker, ‘sing me that song again.’

‘Nay,’ answered the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing; you must
give me something.’

‘Wife,’ said the man, ‘go into the garret; on the upper shelf you will
see a pair of red shoes; bring them to me.’ The wife went in and fetched
the shoes.

‘There, bird,’ said the shoemaker, ‘now sing me that song again.’

The bird flew down and took the red shoes in his left claw, and then he
went back to the roof and sang:

‘My mother killed her little son;
My father grieved when I was gone;
My sister loved me best of all;
She laid her kerchief over me,
And took my bones that they might lie
Underneath the juniper-tree
Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’

When he had finished, he flew away. He had the chain in his right claw
and the shoes in his left, and he flew right away to a mill, and the
mill went ‘Click clack, click clack, click clack.’ Inside the mill were
twenty of the miller’s men hewing a stone, and as they went ‘Hick hack,
hick hack, hick hack,’ the mill went ‘Click clack, click clack, click
clack.’

The bird settled on a lime-tree in front of the mill and sang:

‘My mother killed her little son;

then one of the men left off,

My father grieved when I was gone;

two more men left off and listened,

My sister loved me best of all;

then four more left off,

She laid her kerchief over me,
And took my bones that they might lie

now there were only eight at work,

Underneath

And now only five,

the juniper-tree.

And now only one,

Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’

then he looked up and the last one had left off work.

‘Bird,’ he said, ‘what a beautiful song that is you sing! Let me hear it
too; sing it again.’

‘Nay,’ answered the bird, ‘I do not sing twice for nothing; give me that
millstone, and I will sing it again.’

‘If it belonged to me alone,’ said the man, ‘you should have it.’

‘Yes, yes,’ said the others: ‘if he will sing again, he can have it.’

The bird came down, and all the twenty millers set to and lifted up the
stone with a beam; then the bird put his head through the hole and took
the stone round his neck like a collar, and flew back with it to the
tree and sang--

‘My mother killed her little son;
My father grieved when I was gone;
My sister loved me best of all;
She laid her kerchief over me,
And took my bones that they might lie
Underneath the juniper-tree
Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’

And when he had finished his song, he spread his wings, and with the
chain in his right claw, the shoes in his left, and the millstone round
his neck, he flew right away to his father’s house.

The father, the mother, and little Marleen were having their dinner.

‘How lighthearted I feel,’ said the father, ‘so pleased and cheerful.’

‘And I,’ said the mother, ‘I feel so uneasy, as if a heavy thunderstorm
were coming.’

But little Marleen sat and wept and wept.

Then the bird came flying towards the house and settled on the roof.

‘I do feel so happy,’ said the father, ‘and how beautifully the sun
shines; I feel just as if I were going to see an old friend again.’

‘Ah!’ said the wife, ‘and I am so full of distress and uneasiness that
my teeth chatter, and I feel as if there were a fire in my veins,’ and
she tore open her dress; and all the while little Marleen sat in the
corner and wept, and the plate on her knees was wet with her tears.

The bird now flew to the juniper-tree and began singing:

‘My mother killed her little son;

the mother shut her eyes and her ears, that she might see and hear
nothing, but there was a roaring sound in her ears like that of a
violent storm, and in her eyes a burning and flashing like lightning:

My father grieved when I was gone;

‘Look, mother,’ said the man, ‘at the beautiful bird that is singing so
magnificently; and how warm and bright the sun is, and what a delicious
scent of spice in the air!’

My sister loved me best of all;

then little Marleen laid her head down on her knees and sobbed.

‘I must go outside and see the bird nearer,’ said the man.

‘Ah, do not go!’ cried the wife. ‘I feel as if the whole house were in
flames!’

But the man went out and looked at the bird.

She laid her kerchief over me,
And took my bones that they might lie
Underneath the juniper-tree
Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’

With that the bird let fall the gold chain, and it fell just round the
man’s neck, so that it fitted him exactly.

He went inside, and said, ‘See, what a splendid bird that is; he has
given me this beautiful gold chain, and looks so beautiful himself.’

But the wife was in such fear and trouble, that she fell on the floor,
and her cap fell from her head.

Then the bird began again:

‘My mother killed her little son;

‘Ah me!’ cried the wife, ‘if I were but a thousand feet beneath the
earth, that I might not hear that song.’

My father grieved when I was gone;

then the woman fell down again as if dead.

My sister loved me best of all;

‘Well,’ said little Marleen, ‘I will go out too and see if the bird will
give me anything.’

So she went out.

She laid her kerchief over me,
And took my bones that they might lie

and he threw down the shoes to her,

Underneath the juniper-tree
Kywitt, Kywitt, what a beautiful bird am I!’

And she now felt quite happy and lighthearted; she put on the shoes and
danced and jumped about in them. ‘I was so miserable,’ she said, ‘when I
came out, but that has all passed away; that is indeed a splendid bird,
and he has given me a pair of red shoes.’

The wife sprang up, with her hair standing out from her head like flames
of fire. ‘Then I will go out too,’ she said, ‘and see if it will lighten
my misery, for I feel as if the world were coming to an end.’

But as she crossed the threshold, crash! the bird threw the millstone
down on her head, and she was crushed to death.

The father and little Marleen heard the sound and ran out, but they only
saw mist and flame and fire rising from the spot, and when these had
passed, there stood the little brother, and he took the father and
little Marleen by the hand; then they all three rejoiced, and went
inside together and sat down to their dinners and ate.




THE TURNIP

There were two brothers who were both soldiers; the one was rich and
the other poor. The poor man thought he would try to better himself; so,
pulling off his red coat, he became a gardener, and dug his ground well,
and sowed turnips.

When the seed came up, there was one plant bigger than all the rest; and
it kept getting larger and larger, and seemed as if it would never cease
growing; so that it might have been called the prince of turnips for
there never was such a one seen before, and never will again. At last it
was so big that it filled a cart, and two oxen could hardly draw it; and
the gardener knew not what in the world to do with it, nor whether it
would be a blessing or a curse to him. One day he said to himself, ‘What
shall I do with it? if I sell it, it will bring no more than another;
and for eating, the little turnips are better than this; the best thing
perhaps is to carry it and give it to the king as a mark of respect.’

Then he yoked his oxen, and drew the turnip to the court, and gave it
to the king. ‘What a wonderful thing!’ said the king; ‘I have seen many
strange things, but such a monster as this I never saw. Where did you
get the seed? or is it only your good luck? If so, you are a true child
of fortune.’ ‘Ah, no!’ answered the gardener, ‘I am no child of fortune;
I am a poor soldier, who never could get enough to live upon; so I
laid aside my red coat, and set to work, tilling the ground. I have a
brother, who is rich, and your majesty knows him well, and all the world
knows him; but because I am poor, everybody forgets me.’

The king then took pity on him, and said, ‘You shall be poor no
longer. I will give you so much that you shall be even richer than your
brother.’ Then he gave him gold and lands and flocks, and made him so
rich that his brother’s fortune could not at all be compared with his.

When the brother heard of all this, and how a turnip had made the
gardener so rich, he envied him sorely, and bethought himself how he
could contrive to get the same good fortune for himself. However, he
determined to manage more cleverly than his brother, and got together a
rich present of gold and fine horses for the king; and thought he must
have a much larger gift in return; for if his brother had received so
much for only a turnip, what must his present be worth?

The king took the gift very graciously, and said he knew not what to
give in return more valuable and wonderful than the great turnip; so
the soldier was forced to put it into a cart, and drag it home with him.
When he reached home, he knew not upon whom to vent his rage and spite;
and at length wicked thoughts came into his head, and he resolved to
kill his brother.

So he hired some villains to murder him; and having shown them where to
lie in ambush, he went to his brother, and said, ‘Dear brother, I have
found a hidden treasure; let us go and dig it up, and share it between
us.’ The other had no suspicions of his roguery: so they went out
together, and as they were travelling along, the murderers rushed out
upon him, bound him, and were going to hang him on a tree.

But whilst they were getting all ready, they heard the trampling of a
horse at a distance, which so frightened them that they pushed their
prisoner neck and shoulders together into a sack, and swung him up by a
cord to the tree, where they left him dangling, and ran away. Meantime
he worked and worked away, till he made a hole large enough to put out
his head.

When the horseman came up, he proved to be a student, a merry fellow,
who was journeying along on his nag, and singing as he went. As soon as
the man in the sack saw him passing under the tree, he cried out, ‘Good
morning! good morning to thee, my friend!’ The student looked about
everywhere; and seeing no one, and not knowing where the voice came
from, cried out, ‘Who calls me?’

Then the man in the tree answered, ‘Lift up thine eyes, for behold here
I sit in the sack of wisdom; here have I, in a short time, learned great
and wondrous things. Compared to this seat, all the learning of the
schools is as empty air. A little longer, and I shall know all that man
can know, and shall come forth wiser than the wisest of mankind. Here
I discern the signs and motions of the heavens and the stars; the laws
that control the winds; the number of the sands on the seashore; the
healing of the sick; the virtues of all simples, of birds, and of
precious stones. Wert thou but once here, my friend, though wouldst feel
and own the power of knowledge.

The student listened to all this and wondered much; at last he said,
‘Blessed be the day and hour when I found you; cannot you contrive to
let me into the sack for a little while?’ Then the other answered, as if
very unwillingly, ‘A little space I may allow thee to sit here, if thou
wilt reward me well and entreat me kindly; but thou must tarry yet an
hour below, till I have learnt some little matters that are yet unknown
to me.’

So the student sat himself down and waited a while; but the time hung
heavy upon him, and he begged earnestly that he might ascend forthwith,
for his thirst for knowledge was great. Then the other pretended to give
way, and said, ‘Thou must let the sack of wisdom descend, by untying
yonder cord, and then thou shalt enter.’ So the student let him down,
opened the sack, and set him free. ‘Now then,’ cried he, ‘let me ascend
quickly.’ As he began to put himself into the sack heels first, ‘Wait a
while,’ said the gardener, ‘that is not the way.’ Then he pushed him
in head first, tied up the sack, and soon swung up the searcher after
wisdom dangling in the air. ‘How is it with thee, friend?’ said he,
‘dost thou not feel that wisdom comes unto thee? Rest there in peace,
till thou art a wiser man than thou wert.’

So saying, he trotted off on the student’s nag, and left the poor fellow
to gather wisdom till somebody should come and let him down.




CLEVER HANS

The mother of Hans said: ‘Whither away, Hans?’ Hans answered: ‘To
Gretel.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh, I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’
‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day,
Hans. What do you bring that is good?’ ‘I bring nothing, I want to have
something given me.’ Gretel presents Hans with a needle, Hans says:
‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’

Hans takes the needle, sticks it into a hay-cart, and follows the cart
home. ‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’
‘With Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘Took nothing; had something
given me.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘Gave me a needle.’ ‘Where is the
needle, Hans?’ ‘Stuck in the hay-cart.’ ‘That was ill done, Hans. You
should have stuck the needle in your sleeve.’ ‘Never mind, I’ll do
better next time.’

‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh,
I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to
Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What do you bring that is
good?’ ‘I bring nothing. I want to have something given to me.’ Gretel
presents Hans with a knife. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans
takes the knife, sticks it in his sleeve, and goes home. ‘Good evening,
mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With Gretel.’ What
did you take her?’ ‘Took her nothing, she gave me something.’ ‘What did
Gretel give you?’ ‘Gave me a knife.’ ‘Where is the knife, Hans?’ ‘Stuck
in my sleeve.’ ‘That’s ill done, Hans, you should have put the knife in
your pocket.’ ‘Never mind, will do better next time.’

‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh,
I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to
Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What good thing do you
bring?’ ‘I bring nothing, I want something given me.’ Gretel presents
Hans with a young goat. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans takes
the goat, ties its legs, and puts it in his pocket. When he gets home it
is suffocated. ‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have
you been?’ ‘With Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘Took nothing, she
gave me something.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘She gave me a goat.’
‘Where is the goat, Hans?’ ‘Put it in my pocket.’ ‘That was ill done,
Hans, you should have put a rope round the goat’s neck.’ ‘Never mind,
will do better next time.’

‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘Oh,
I’ll behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to
Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What good thing do you
bring?’ ‘I bring nothing, I want something given me.’ Gretel presents
Hans with a piece of bacon. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’

Hans takes the bacon, ties it to a rope, and drags it away behind him.
The dogs come and devour the bacon. When he gets home, he has the rope
in his hand, and there is no longer anything hanging on to it. ‘Good
evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With
Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘I took her nothing, she gave me
something.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘Gave me a bit of bacon.’ ‘Where
is the bacon, Hans?’ ‘I tied it to a rope, brought it home, dogs took
it.’ ‘That was ill done, Hans, you should have carried the bacon on your
head.’ ‘Never mind, will do better next time.’

‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘I’ll
behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’ Hans comes to Gretel.
‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans, What good thing do you bring?’ ‘I
bring nothing, but would have something given.’ Gretel presents Hans
with a calf. ‘Goodbye, Gretel.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’

Hans takes the calf, puts it on his head, and the calf kicks his face.
‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With
Gretel.’ ‘What did you take her?’ ‘I took nothing, but had something
given me.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘A calf.’ ‘Where have you the
calf, Hans?’ ‘I set it on my head and it kicked my face.’ ‘That was
ill done, Hans, you should have led the calf, and put it in the stall.’
‘Never mind, will do better next time.’

‘Whither away, Hans?’ ‘To Gretel, mother.’ ‘Behave well, Hans.’ ‘I’ll
behave well. Goodbye, mother.’ ‘Goodbye, Hans.’

Hans comes to Gretel. ‘Good day, Gretel.’ ‘Good day, Hans. What good
thing do you bring?’ ‘I bring nothing, but would have something given.’
Gretel says to Hans: ‘I will go with you.’

Hans takes Gretel, ties her to a rope, leads her to the rack, and binds
her fast. Then Hans goes to his mother. ‘Good evening, mother.’ ‘Good
evening, Hans. Where have you been?’ ‘With Gretel.’ ‘What did you take
her?’ ‘I took her nothing.’ ‘What did Gretel give you?’ ‘She gave me
nothing, she came with me.’ ‘Where have you left Gretel?’ ‘I led her by
the rope, tied her to the rack, and scattered some grass for her.’ ‘That
was ill done, Hans, you should have cast friendly eyes on her.’ ‘Never
mind, will do better.’

Hans went into the stable, cut out all the calves’ and sheep’s eyes,
and threw them in Gretel’s face. Then Gretel became angry, tore herself
loose and ran away, and was no longer the bride of Hans.




THE THREE LANGUAGES

An aged count once lived in Switzerland, who had an only son, but he
was stupid, and could learn nothing. Then said the father: ‘Hark you,
my son, try as I will I can get nothing into your head. You must go from
hence, I will give you into the care of a celebrated master, who shall
see what he can do with you.’ The youth was sent into a strange town,
and remained a whole year with the master. At the end of this time,
he came home again, and his father asked: ‘Now, my son, what have you
learnt?’ ‘Father, I have learnt what the dogs say when they bark.’ ‘Lord
have mercy on us!’ cried the father; ‘is that all you have learnt? I
will send you into another town, to another master.’ The youth was taken
thither, and stayed a year with this master likewise. When he came back
the father again asked: ‘My son, what have you learnt?’ He answered:
‘Father, I have learnt what the birds say.’ Then the father fell into a
rage and said: ‘Oh, you lost man, you have spent the precious time and
learnt nothing; are you not ashamed to appear before my eyes? I will
send you to a third master, but if you learn nothing this time also, I
will no longer be your father.’ The youth remained a whole year with the
third master also, and when he came home again, and his father inquired:
‘My son, what have you learnt?’ he answered: ‘Dear father, I have this
year learnt what the frogs croak.’ Then the father fell into the most
furious anger, sprang up, called his people thither, and said: ‘This man
is no longer my son, I drive him forth, and command you to take him
out into the forest, and kill him.’ They took him forth, but when they
should have killed him, they could not do it for pity, and let him go,
and they cut the eyes and tongue out of a deer that they might carry
them to the old man as a token.

The youth wandered on, and after some time came to a fortress where he
begged for a night’s lodging. ‘Yes,’ said the lord of the castle, ‘if
you will pass the night down there in the old tower, go thither; but I
warn you, it is at the peril of your life, for it is full of wild dogs,
which bark and howl without stopping, and at certain hours a man has to
be given to them, whom they at once devour.’ The whole district was in
sorrow and dismay because of them, and yet no one could do anything to
stop this. The youth, however, was without fear, and said: ‘Just let me
go down to the barking dogs, and give me something that I can throw to
them; they will do nothing to harm me.’ As he himself would have it so,
they gave him some food for the wild animals, and led him down to the
tower. When he went inside, the dogs did not bark at him, but wagged
their tails quite amicably around him, ate what he set before them, and
did not hurt one hair of his head. Next morning, to the astonishment of
everyone, he came out again safe and unharmed, and said to the lord of
the castle: ‘The dogs have revealed to me, in their own language, why
they dwell there, and bring evil on the land. They are bewitched, and
are obliged to watch over a great treasure which is below in the tower,
and they can have no rest until it is taken away, and I have likewise
learnt, from their discourse, how that is to be done.’ Then all who
heard this rejoiced, and the lord of the castle said he would adopt him
as a son if he accomplished it successfully. He went down again, and
as he knew what he had to do, he did it thoroughly, and brought a chest
full of gold out with him. The howling of the wild dogs was henceforth
heard no more; they had disappeared, and the country was freed from the
trouble.

After some time he took it in his head that he would travel to Rome. On
the way he passed by a marsh, in which a number of frogs were sitting
croaking. He listened to them, and when he became aware of what they
were saying, he grew very thoughtful and sad. At last he arrived in
Rome, where the Pope had just died, and there was great doubt among
the cardinals as to whom they should appoint as his successor. They at
length agreed that the person should be chosen as pope who should be
distinguished by some divine and miraculous token. And just as that was
decided on, the young count entered into the church, and suddenly two
snow-white doves flew on his shoulders and remained sitting there. The
ecclesiastics recognized therein the token from above, and asked him on
the spot if he would be pope. He was undecided, and knew not if he were
worthy of this, but the doves counselled him to do it, and at length he
said yes. Then was he anointed and consecrated, and thus was fulfilled
what he had heard from the frogs on his way, which had so affected him,
that he was to be his Holiness the Pope. Then he had to sing a mass, and
did not know one word of it, but the two doves sat continually on his
shoulders, and said it all in his ear.




THE FOX AND THE CAT

It happened that the cat met the fox in a forest, and as she thought to
herself: ‘He is clever and full of experience, and much esteemed in the
world,’ she spoke to him in a friendly way. ‘Good day, dear Mr Fox,
how are you? How is all with you? How are you getting on in these hard
times?’ The fox, full of all kinds of arrogance, looked at the cat from
head to foot, and for a long time did not know whether he would give
any answer or not. At last he said: ‘Oh, you wretched beard-cleaner, you
piebald fool, you hungry mouse-hunter, what can you be thinking of? Have
you the cheek to ask how I am getting on? What have you learnt? How
many arts do you understand?’ ‘I understand but one,’ replied the
cat, modestly. ‘What art is that?’ asked the fox. ‘When the hounds are
following me, I can spring into a tree and save myself.’ ‘Is that all?’
said the fox. ‘I am master of a hundred arts, and have into the bargain
a sackful of cunning. You make me sorry for you; come with me, I will
teach you how people get away from the hounds.’ Just then came a hunter
with four dogs. The cat sprang nimbly up a tree, and sat down at the top
of it, where the branches and foliage quite concealed her. ‘Open your
sack, Mr Fox, open your sack,’ cried the cat to him, but the dogs had
already seized him, and were holding him fast. ‘Ah, Mr Fox,’ cried the
cat. ‘You with your hundred arts are left in the lurch! Had you been
able to climb like me, you would not have lost your life.’




THE FOUR CLEVER BROTHERS

‘Dear children,’ said a poor man to his four sons, ‘I have nothing to
give you; you must go out into the wide world and try your luck. Begin
by learning some craft or another, and see how you can get on.’ So the
four brothers took their walking-sticks in their hands, and their little
bundles on their shoulders, and after bidding their father goodbye, went
all out at the gate together. When they had got on some way they came
to four crossways, each leading to a different country. Then the eldest
said, ‘Here we must part; but this day four years we will come back
to this spot, and in the meantime each must try what he can do for
himself.’

So each brother went his way; and as the eldest was hastening on a man
met him, and asked him where he was going, and what he wanted. ‘I am
going to try my luck in the world, and should like to begin by learning
some art or trade,’ answered he. ‘Then,’ said the man, ‘go with me, and
I will teach you to become the cunningest thief that ever was.’ ‘No,’
said the other, ‘that is not an honest calling, and what can one look
to earn by it in the end but the gallows?’ ‘Oh!’ said the man, ‘you need
not fear the gallows; for I will only teach you to steal what will be
fair game: I meddle with nothing but what no one else can get or care
anything about, and where no one can find you out.’ So the young man
agreed to follow his trade, and he soon showed himself so clever, that
nothing could escape him that he had once set his mind upon.

The second brother also met a man, who, when he found out what he was
setting out upon, asked him what craft he meant to follow. ‘I do not
know yet,’ said he. ‘Then come with me, and be a star-gazer. It is a
noble art, for nothing can be hidden from you, when once you understand
the stars.’ The plan pleased him much, and he soon became such a skilful
star-gazer, that when he had served out his time, and wanted to leave
his master, he gave him a glass, and said, ‘With this you can see all
that is passing in the sky and on earth, and nothing can be hidden from
you.’

The third brother met a huntsman, who took him with him, and taught him
so well all that belonged to hunting, that he became very clever in the
craft of the woods; and when he left his master he gave him a bow, and
said, ‘Whatever you shoot at with this bow you will be sure to hit.’

The youngest brother likewise met a man who asked him what he wished to
do. ‘Would not you like,’ said he, ‘to be a tailor?’ ‘Oh, no!’ said
the young man; ‘sitting cross-legged from morning to night, working
backwards and forwards with a needle and goose, will never suit me.’
‘Oh!’ answered the man, ‘that is not my sort of tailoring; come with me,
and you will learn quite another kind of craft from that.’ Not knowing
what better to do, he came into the plan, and learnt tailoring from the
beginning; and when he left his master, he gave him a needle, and said,
‘You can sew anything with this, be it as soft as an egg or as hard as
steel; and the joint will be so fine that no seam will be seen.’

After the space of four years, at the time agreed upon, the four
brothers met at the four cross-roads; and having welcomed each other,
set off towards their father’s home, where they told him all that had
happened to them, and how each had learned some craft.

Then, one day, as they were sitting before the house under a very high
tree, the father said, ‘I should like to try what each of you can do in
this way.’ So he looked up, and said to the second son, ‘At the top of
this tree there is a chaffinch’s nest; tell me how many eggs there are
in it.’ The star-gazer took his glass, looked up, and said, ‘Five.’
‘Now,’ said the father to the eldest son, ‘take away the eggs without
letting the bird that is sitting upon them and hatching them know
anything of what you are doing.’ So the cunning thief climbed up the
tree, and brought away to his father the five eggs from under the bird;
and it never saw or felt what he was doing, but kept sitting on at its
ease. Then the father took the eggs, and put one on each corner of the
table, and the fifth in the middle, and said to the huntsman, ‘Cut all
the eggs in two pieces at one shot.’ The huntsman took up his bow, and
at one shot struck all the five eggs as his father wished.

‘Now comes your turn,’ said he to the young tailor; ‘sew the eggs and
the young birds in them together again, so neatly that the shot shall
have done them no harm.’ Then the tailor took his needle, and sewed the
eggs as he was told; and when he had done, the thief was sent to take
them back to the nest, and put them under the bird without its knowing
it. Then she went on sitting, and hatched them: and in a few days they
crawled out, and had only a little red streak across their necks, where
the tailor had sewn them together.

‘Well done, sons!’ said the old man; ‘you have made good use of your
time, and learnt something worth the knowing; but I am sure I do not
know which ought to have the prize. Oh, that a time might soon come for
you to turn your skill to some account!’

Not long after this there was a great bustle in the country; for the
king’s daughter had been carried off by a mighty dragon, and the king
mourned over his loss day and night, and made it known that whoever
brought her back to him should have her for a wife. Then the four
brothers said to each other, ‘Here is a chance for us; let us try
what we can do.’ And they agreed to see whether they could not set the
princess free. ‘I will soon find out where she is, however,’ said the
star-gazer, as he looked through his glass; and he soon cried out, ‘I
see her afar off, sitting upon a rock in the sea, and I can spy the
dragon close by, guarding her.’ Then he went to the king, and asked for
a ship for himself and his brothers; and they sailed together over the
sea, till they came to the right place. There they found the princess
sitting, as the star-gazer had said, on the rock; and the dragon was
lying asleep, with his head upon her lap. ‘I dare not shoot at him,’
said the huntsman, ‘for I should kill the beautiful young lady also.’
‘Then I will try my skill,’ said the thief, and went and stole her away
from under the dragon, so quietly and gently that the beast did not know
it, but went on snoring.

Then away they hastened with her full of joy in their boat towards the
ship; but soon came the dragon roaring behind them through the air; for
he awoke and missed the princess. But when he got over the boat, and
wanted to pounce upon them and carry off the princess, the huntsman took
up his bow and shot him straight through the heart so that he fell down
dead. They were still not safe; for he was such a great beast that in
his fall he overset the boat, and they had to swim in the open sea
upon a few planks. So the tailor took his needle, and with a few large
stitches put some of the planks together; and he sat down upon these,
and sailed about and gathered up all pieces of the boat; and then tacked
them together so quickly that the boat was soon ready, and they then
reached the ship and got home safe.

When they had brought home the princess to her father, there was great
rejoicing; and he said to the four brothers, ‘One of you shall marry
her, but you must settle amongst yourselves which it is to be.’ Then
there arose a quarrel between them; and the star-gazer said, ‘If I had
not found the princess out, all your skill would have been of no use;
therefore she ought to be mine.’ ‘Your seeing her would have been of
no use,’ said the thief, ‘if I had not taken her away from the dragon;
therefore she ought to be mine.’ ‘No, she is mine,’ said the huntsman;
‘for if I had not killed the dragon, he would, after all, have torn you
and the princess into pieces.’ ‘And if I had not sewn the boat together
again,’ said the tailor, ‘you would all have been drowned, therefore she
is mine.’ Then the king put in a word, and said, ‘Each of you is right;
and as all cannot have the young lady, the best way is for neither of
you to have her: for the truth is, there is somebody she likes a great
deal better. But to make up for your loss, I will give each of you, as a
reward for his skill, half a kingdom.’ So the brothers agreed that this
plan would be much better than either quarrelling or marrying a lady who
had no mind to have them. And the king then gave to each half a kingdom,
as he had said; and they lived very happily the rest of their days, and
took good care of their father; and somebody took better care of the
young lady, than to let either the dragon or one of the craftsmen have
her again.




LILY AND THE LION

A merchant, who had three daughters, was once setting out upon a
journey; but before he went he asked each daughter what gift he should
bring back for her. The eldest wished for pearls; the second for jewels;
but the third, who was called Lily, said, ‘Dear father, bring me a
rose.’ Now it was no easy task to find a rose, for it was the middle
of winter; yet as she was his prettiest daughter, and was very fond of
flowers, her father said he would try what he could do. So he kissed all
three, and bid them goodbye.

And when the time came for him to go home, he had bought pearls and
jewels for the two eldest, but he had sought everywhere in vain for the
rose; and when he went into any garden and asked for such a thing, the
people laughed at him, and asked him whether he thought roses grew in
snow. This grieved him very much, for Lily was his dearest child; and as
he was journeying home, thinking what he should bring her, he came to a
fine castle; and around the castle was a garden, in one half of which it
seemed to be summer-time and in the other half winter. On one side the
finest flowers were in full bloom, and on the other everything looked
dreary and buried in the snow. ‘A lucky hit!’ said he, as he called to
his servant, and told him to go to a beautiful bed of roses that was
there, and bring him away one of the finest flowers.

This done, they were riding away well pleased, when up sprang a fierce
lion, and roared out, ‘Whoever has stolen my roses shall be eaten up
alive!’ Then the man said, ‘I knew not that the garden belonged to you;
can nothing save my life?’ ‘No!’ said the lion, ‘nothing, unless you
undertake to give me whatever meets you on your return home; if you
agree to this, I will give you your life, and the rose too for your
daughter.’ But the man was unwilling to do so and said, ‘It may be my
youngest daughter, who loves me most, and always runs to meet me when
I go home.’ Then the servant was greatly frightened, and said, ‘It may
perhaps be only a cat or a dog.’ And at last the man yielded with a
heavy heart, and took the rose; and said he would give the lion whatever
should meet him first on his return.

And as he came near home, it was Lily, his youngest and dearest
daughter, that met him; she came running, and kissed him, and welcomed
him home; and when she saw that he had brought her the rose, she was
still more glad. But her father began to be very sorrowful, and to weep,
saying, ‘Alas, my dearest child! I have bought this flower at a high
price, for I have said I would give you to a wild lion; and when he has
you, he will tear you in pieces, and eat you.’ Then he told her all that
had happened, and said she should not go, let what would happen.

But she comforted him, and said, ‘Dear father, the word you have given
must be kept; I will go to the lion, and soothe him: perhaps he will let
me come safe home again.’

The next morning she asked the way she was to go, and took leave of her
father, and went forth with a bold heart into the wood. But the lion was
an enchanted prince. By day he and all his court were lions, but in the
evening they took their right forms again. And when Lily came to the
castle, he welcomed her so courteously that she agreed to marry him. The
wedding-feast was held, and they lived happily together a long time. The
prince was only to be seen as soon as evening came, and then he held his
court; but every morning he left his bride, and went away by himself,
she knew not whither, till the night came again.

After some time he said to her, ‘Tomorrow there will be a great feast in
your father’s house, for your eldest sister is to be married; and if
you wish to go and visit her my lions shall lead you thither.’ Then she
rejoiced much at the thoughts of seeing her father once more, and set
out with the lions; and everyone was overjoyed to see her, for they had
thought her dead long since. But she told them how happy she was, and
stayed till the feast was over, and then went back to the wood.

Her second sister was soon after married, and when Lily was asked to
go to the wedding, she said to the prince, ‘I will not go alone this
time--you must go with me.’ But he would not, and said that it would be
a very hazardous thing; for if the least ray of the torch-light should
fall upon him his enchantment would become still worse, for he should be
changed into a dove, and be forced to wander about the world for seven
long years. However, she gave him no rest, and said she would take care
no light should fall upon him. So at last they set out together, and
took with them their little child; and she chose a large hall with thick
walls for him to sit in while the wedding-torches were lighted; but,
unluckily, no one saw that there was a crack in the door. Then the
wedding was held with great pomp, but as the train came from the church,
and passed with the torches before the hall, a very small ray of light
fell upon the prince. In a moment he disappeared, and when his wife came
in and looked for him, she found only a white dove; and it said to her,
‘Seven years must I fly up and down over the face of the earth, but
every now and then I will let fall a white feather, that will show you
the way I am going; follow it, and at last you may overtake and set me
free.’

This said, he flew out at the door, and poor Lily followed; and every
now and then a white feather fell, and showed her the way she was to
journey. Thus she went roving on through the wide world, and looked
neither to the right hand nor to the left, nor took any rest, for seven
years. Then she began to be glad, and thought to herself that the time
was fast coming when all her troubles should end; yet repose was still
far off, for one day as she was travelling on she missed the white
feather, and when she lifted up her eyes she could nowhere see the dove.
‘Now,’ thought she to herself, ‘no aid of man can be of use to me.’ So
she went to the sun and said, ‘Thou shinest everywhere, on the hill’s
top and the valley’s depth--hast thou anywhere seen my white dove?’
‘No,’ said the sun, ‘I have not seen it; but I will give thee a
casket--open it when thy hour of need comes.’

So she thanked the sun, and went on her way till eventide; and when
the moon arose, she cried unto it, and said, ‘Thou shinest through the
night, over field and grove--hast thou nowhere seen my white dove?’
‘No,’ said the moon, ‘I cannot help thee but I will give thee an
egg--break it when need comes.’

Then she thanked the moon, and went on till the night-wind blew; and she
raised up her voice to it, and said, ‘Thou blowest through every tree
and under every leaf--hast thou not seen my white dove?’ ‘No,’ said the
night-wind, ‘but I will ask three other winds; perhaps they have seen
it.’ Then the east wind and the west wind came, and said they too had
not seen it, but the south wind said, ‘I have seen the white dove--he
has fled to the Red Sea, and is changed once more into a lion, for the
seven years are passed away, and there he is fighting with a dragon;
and the dragon is an enchanted princess, who seeks to separate him from
you.’ Then the night-wind said, ‘I will give thee counsel. Go to the
Red Sea; on the right shore stand many rods--count them, and when thou
comest to the eleventh, break it off, and smite the dragon with it; and
so the lion will have the victory, and both of them will appear to you
in their own forms. Then look round and thou wilt see a griffin, winged
like bird, sitting by the Red Sea; jump on to his back with thy beloved
one as quickly as possible, and he will carry you over the waters to
your home. I will also give thee this nut,’ continued the night-wind.
‘When you are half-way over, throw it down, and out of the waters will
immediately spring up a high nut-tree on which the griffin will be able
to rest, otherwise he would not have the strength to bear you the whole
way; if, therefore, thou dost forget to throw down the nut, he will let
you both fall into the sea.’

So our poor wanderer went forth, and found all as the night-wind had
said; and she plucked the eleventh rod, and smote the dragon, and the
lion forthwith became a prince, and the dragon a princess again. But
no sooner was the princess released from the spell, than she seized
the prince by the arm and sprang on to the griffin’s back, and went off
carrying the prince away with her.

Thus the unhappy traveller was again forsaken and forlorn; but she
took heart and said, ‘As far as the wind blows, and so long as the cock
crows, I will journey on, till I find him once again.’ She went on for
a long, long way, till at length she came to the castle whither the
princess had carried the prince; and there was a feast got ready, and
she heard that the wedding was about to be held. ‘Heaven aid me now!’
said she; and she took the casket that the sun had given her, and found
that within it lay a dress as dazzling as the sun itself. So she put it
on, and went into the palace, and all the people gazed upon her; and
the dress pleased the bride so much that she asked whether it was to be
sold. ‘Not for gold and silver.’ said she, ‘but for flesh and blood.’
The princess asked what she meant, and she said, ‘Let me speak with the
bridegroom this night in his chamber, and I will give thee the dress.’
At last the princess agreed, but she told her chamberlain to give the
prince a sleeping draught, that he might not hear or see her. When
evening came, and the prince had fallen asleep, she was led into
his chamber, and she sat herself down at his feet, and said: ‘I have
followed thee seven years. I have been to the sun, the moon, and the
night-wind, to seek thee, and at last I have helped thee to overcome
the dragon. Wilt thou then forget me quite?’ But the prince all the time
slept so soundly, that her voice only passed over him, and seemed like
the whistling of the wind among the fir-trees.

Then poor Lily was led away, and forced to give up the golden dress; and
when she saw that there was no help for her, she went out into a meadow,
and sat herself down and wept. But as she sat she bethought herself of
the egg that the moon had given her; and when she broke it, there ran
out a hen and twelve chickens of pure gold, that played about, and then
nestled under the old one’s wings, so as to form the most beautiful
sight in the world. And she rose up and drove them before her, till the
bride saw them from her window, and was so pleased that she came forth
and asked her if she would sell the brood. ‘Not for gold or silver, but
for flesh and blood: let me again this evening speak with the bridegroom
in his chamber, and I will give thee the whole brood.’

Then the princess thought to betray her as before, and agreed to
what she asked: but when the prince went to his chamber he asked
the chamberlain why the wind had whistled so in the night. And the
chamberlain told him all--how he had given him a sleeping draught, and
how a poor maiden had come and spoken to him in his chamber, and was
to come again that night. Then the prince took care to throw away the
sleeping draught; and when Lily came and began again to tell him what
woes had befallen her, and how faithful and true to him she had been,
he knew his beloved wife’s voice, and sprang up, and said, ‘You have
awakened me as from a dream, for the strange princess had thrown a spell
around me, so that I had altogether forgotten you; but Heaven hath sent
you to me in a lucky hour.’

And they stole away out of the palace by night unawares, and seated
themselves on the griffin, who flew back with them over the Red Sea.
When they were half-way across Lily let the nut fall into the water,
and immediately a large nut-tree arose from the sea, whereon the griffin
rested for a while, and then carried them safely home. There they found
their child, now grown up to be comely and fair; and after all their
troubles they lived happily together to the end of their days.




THE FOX AND THE HORSE

A farmer had a horse that had been an excellent faithful servant to
him: but he was now grown too old to work; so the farmer would give him
nothing more to eat, and said, ‘I want you no longer, so take yourself
off out of my stable; I shall not take you back again until you are
stronger than a lion.’ Then he opened the door and turned him adrift.

The poor horse was very melancholy, and wandered up and down in the
wood, seeking some little shelter from the cold wind and rain. Presently
a fox met him: ‘What’s the matter, my friend?’ said he, ‘why do you hang
down your head and look so lonely and woe-begone?’ ‘Ah!’ replied the
horse, ‘justice and avarice never dwell in one house; my master has
forgotten all that I have done for him so many years, and because I
can no longer work he has turned me adrift, and says unless I become
stronger than a lion he will not take me back again; what chance can I
have of that? he knows I have none, or he would not talk so.’

However, the fox bid him be of good cheer, and said, ‘I will help you;
lie down there, stretch yourself out quite stiff, and pretend to be
dead.’ The horse did as he was told, and the fox went straight to the
lion who lived in a cave close by, and said to him, ‘A little way off
lies a dead horse; come with me and you may make an excellent meal of
his carcase.’ The lion was greatly pleased, and set off immediately; and
when they came to the horse, the fox said, ‘You will not be able to eat
him comfortably here; I’ll tell you what--I will tie you fast to
his tail, and then you can draw him to your den, and eat him at your
leisure.’

This advice pleased the lion, so he laid himself down quietly for the
fox to make him fast to the horse. But the fox managed to tie his legs
together and bound all so hard and fast that with all his strength he
could not set himself free. When the work was done, the fox clapped the
horse on the shoulder, and said, ‘Jip! Dobbin! Jip!’ Then up he sprang,
and moved off, dragging the lion behind him. The beast began to roar
and bellow, till all the birds of the wood flew away for fright; but the
horse let him sing on, and made his way quietly over the fields to his
master’s house.

‘Here he is, master,’ said he, ‘I have got the better of him’: and when
the farmer saw his old servant, his heart relented, and he said. ‘Thou
shalt stay in thy stable and be well taken care of.’ And so the poor old
horse had plenty to eat, and lived--till he died.




THE BLUE LIGHT

There was once upon a time a soldier who for many years had served the
king faithfully, but when the war came to an end could serve no longer
because of the many wounds which he had received. The king said to him:
‘You may return to your home, I need you no longer, and you will not
receive any more money, for he only receives wages who renders me
service for them.’ Then the soldier did not know how to earn a living,
went away greatly troubled, and walked the whole day, until in the
evening he entered a forest. When darkness came on, he saw a light,
which he went up to, and came to a house wherein lived a witch. ‘Do give
me one night’s lodging, and a little to eat and drink,’ said he to
her, ‘or I shall starve.’ ‘Oho!’ she answered, ‘who gives anything to a
run-away soldier? Yet will I be compassionate, and take you in, if you
will do what I wish.’ ‘What do you wish?’ said the soldier. ‘That you
should dig all round my garden for me, tomorrow.’ The soldier consented,
and next day laboured with all his strength, but could not finish it by
the evening. ‘I see well enough,’ said the witch, ‘that you can do no
more today, but I will keep you yet another night, in payment for
which you must tomorrow chop me a load of wood, and chop it small.’ The
soldier spent the whole day in doing it, and in the evening the witch
proposed that he should stay one night more. ‘Tomorrow, you shall only
do me a very trifling piece of work. Behind my house, there is an old
dry well, into which my light has fallen, it burns blue, and never goes
out, and you shall bring it up again.’ Next day the old woman took him
to the well, and let him down in a basket. He found the blue light, and
made her a signal to draw him up again. She did draw him up, but when he
came near the edge, she stretched down her hand and wanted to take the
blue light away from him. ‘No,’ said he, perceiving her evil intention,
‘I will not give you the light until I am standing with both feet upon
the ground.’ The witch fell into a passion, let him fall again into the
well, and went away.

The poor soldier fell without injury on the moist ground, and the blue
light went on burning, but of what use was that to him? He saw very well
that he could not escape death. He sat for a while very sorrowfully,
then suddenly he felt in his pocket and found his tobacco pipe, which
was still half full. ‘This shall be my last pleasure,’ thought he,
pulled it out, lit it at the blue light and began to smoke. When the
smoke had circled about the cavern, suddenly a little black dwarf stood
before him, and said: ‘Lord, what are your commands?’ ‘What my commands
are?’ replied the soldier, quite astonished. ‘I must do everything you
bid me,’ said the little man. ‘Good,’ said the soldier; ‘then in the
first place help me out of this well.’ The little man took him by the
hand, and led him through an underground passage, but he did not forget
to take the blue light with him. On the way the dwarf showed him the
treasures which the witch had collected and hidden there, and the
soldier took as much gold as he could carry. When he was above, he said
to the little man: ‘Now go and bind the old witch, and carry her before
the judge.’ In a short time she came by like the wind, riding on a wild
tom-cat and screaming frightfully. Nor was it long before the little man
reappeared. ‘It is all done,’ said he, ‘and the witch is already hanging
on the gallows. What further commands has my lord?’ inquired the dwarf.
‘At this moment, none,’ answered the soldier; ‘you can return home, only
be at hand immediately, if I summon you.’ ‘Nothing more is needed than
that you should light your pipe at the blue light, and I will appear
before you at once.’ Thereupon he vanished from his sight.

The soldier returned to the town from which he came. He went to the
best inn, ordered himself handsome clothes, and then bade the landlord
furnish him a room as handsome as possible. When it was ready and the
soldier had taken possession of it, he summoned the little black manikin
and said: ‘I have served the king faithfully, but he has dismissed me,
and left me to hunger, and now I want to take my revenge.’ ‘What am I to
do?’ asked the little man. ‘Late at night, when the king’s daughter is
in bed, bring her here in her sleep, she shall do servant’s work for
me.’ The manikin said: ‘That is an easy thing for me to do, but a very
dangerous thing for you, for if it is discovered, you will fare ill.’
When twelve o’clock had struck, the door sprang open, and the manikin
carried in the princess. ‘Aha! are you there?’ cried the soldier, ‘get
to your work at once! Fetch the broom and sweep the chamber.’ When
she had done this, he ordered her to come to his chair, and then he
stretched out his feet and said: ‘Pull off my boots,’ and then he
threw them in her face, and made her pick them up again, and clean
and brighten them. She, however, did everything he bade her, without
opposition, silently and with half-shut eyes. When the first cock
crowed, the manikin carried her back to the royal palace, and laid her
in her bed.

Next morning when the princess arose she went to her father, and told
him that she had had a very strange dream. ‘I was carried through the
streets with the rapidity of lightning,’ said she, ‘and taken into a
soldier’s room, and I had to wait upon him like a servant, sweep his
room, clean his boots, and do all kinds of menial work. It was only a
dream, and yet I am just as tired as if I really had done everything.’
‘The dream may have been true,’ said the king. ‘I will give you a piece
of advice. Fill your pocket full of peas, and make a small hole in the
pocket, and then if you are carried away again, they will fall out and
leave a track in the streets.’ But unseen by the king, the manikin was
standing beside him when he said that, and heard all. At night when
the sleeping princess was again carried through the streets, some peas
certainly did fall out of her pocket, but they made no track, for the
crafty manikin had just before scattered peas in every street there
was. And again the princess was compelled to do servant’s work until
cock-crow.

Next morning the king sent his people out to seek the track, but it was
all in vain, for in every street poor children were sitting, picking up
peas, and saying: ‘It must have rained peas, last night.’ ‘We must think
of something else,’ said the king; ‘keep your shoes on when you go to
bed, and before you come back from the place where you are taken, hide
one of them there, I will soon contrive to find it.’ The black manikin
heard this plot, and at night when the soldier again ordered him to
bring the princess, revealed it to him, and told him that he knew of no
expedient to counteract this stratagem, and that if the shoe were found
in the soldier’s house it would go badly with him. ‘Do what I bid you,’
replied the soldier, and again this third night the princess was obliged
to work like a servant, but before she went away, she hid her shoe under
the bed.

Next morning the king had the entire town searched for his daughter’s
shoe. It was found at the soldier’s, and the soldier himself, who at the
entreaty of the dwarf had gone outside the gate, was soon brought back,
and thrown into prison. In his flight he had forgotten the most valuable
things he had, the blue light and the gold, and had only one ducat in
his pocket. And now loaded with chains, he was standing at the window of
his dungeon, when he chanced to see one of his comrades passing by. The
soldier tapped at the pane of glass, and when this man came up, said to
him: ‘Be so kind as to fetch me the small bundle I have left lying in
the inn, and I will give you a ducat for doing it.’ His comrade ran
thither and brought him what he wanted. As soon as the soldier was alone
again, he lighted his pipe and summoned the black manikin. ‘Have no
fear,’ said the latter to his master. ‘Go wheresoever they take you, and
let them do what they will, only take the blue light with you.’ Next day
the soldier was tried, and though he had done nothing wicked, the judge
condemned him to death. When he was led forth to die, he begged a last
favour of the king. ‘What is it?’ asked the king. ‘That I may smoke one
more pipe on my way.’ ‘You may smoke three,’ answered the king, ‘but do
not imagine that I will spare your life.’ Then the soldier pulled out
his pipe and lighted it at the blue light, and as soon as a few wreaths
of smoke had ascended, the manikin was there with a small cudgel in his
hand, and said: ‘What does my lord command?’ ‘Strike down to earth that
false judge there, and his constable, and spare not the king who has
treated me so ill.’ Then the manikin fell on them like lightning,
darting this way and that way, and whosoever was so much as touched by
his cudgel fell to earth, and did not venture to stir again. The king
was terrified; he threw himself on the soldier’s mercy, and merely to
be allowed to live at all, gave him his kingdom for his own, and his
daughter to wife.




THE RAVEN

There was once a queen who had a little daughter, still too young to run
alone. One day the child was very troublesome, and the mother could not
quiet it, do what she would. She grew impatient, and seeing the ravens
flying round the castle, she opened the window, and said: ‘I wish you
were a raven and would fly away, then I should have a little peace.’
Scarcely were the words out of her mouth, when the child in her arms was
turned into a raven, and flew away from her through the open window. The
bird took its flight to a dark wood and remained there for a long time,
and meanwhile the parents could hear nothing of their child.

Long after this, a man was making his way through the wood when he heard
a raven calling, and he followed the sound of the voice. As he drew
near, the raven said, ‘I am by birth a king’s daughter, but am now under
the spell of some enchantment; you can, however, set me free.’ ‘What
am I to do?’ he asked. She replied, ‘Go farther into the wood until you
come to a house, wherein lives an old woman; she will offer you food and
drink, but you must not take of either; if you do, you will fall into
a deep sleep, and will not be able to help me. In the garden behind the
house is a large tan-heap, and on that you must stand and watch for me.
I shall drive there in my carriage at two o’clock in the afternoon for
three successive days; the first day it will be drawn by four white, the
second by four chestnut, and the last by four black horses; but if you
fail to keep awake and I find you sleeping, I shall not be set free.’

The man promised to do all that she wished, but the raven said, ‘Alas! I
know even now that you will take something from the woman and be unable
to save me.’ The man assured her again that he would on no account touch
a thing to eat or drink.

When he came to the house and went inside, the old woman met him, and
said, ‘Poor man! how tired you are! Come in and rest and let me give you
something to eat and drink.’

‘No,’ answered the man, ‘I will neither eat not drink.’

But she would not leave him alone, and urged him saying, ‘If you will
not eat anything, at least you might take a draught of wine; one drink
counts for nothing,’ and at last he allowed himself to be persuaded, and
drank.

As it drew towards the appointed hour, he went outside into the garden
and mounted the tan-heap to await the raven. Suddenly a feeling of
fatigue came over him, and unable to resist it, he lay down for a little
while, fully determined, however, to keep awake; but in another minute
his eyes closed of their own accord, and he fell into such a deep sleep,
that all the noises in the world would not have awakened him. At two
o’clock the raven came driving along, drawn by her four white horses;
but even before she reached the spot, she said to herself, sighing, ‘I
know he has fallen asleep.’ When she entered the garden, there she found
him as she had feared, lying on the tan-heap, fast asleep. She got out
of her carriage and went to him; she called him and shook him, but it
was all in vain, he still continued sleeping.

The next day at noon, the old woman came to him again with food and
drink which he at first refused. At last, overcome by her persistent
entreaties that he would take something, he lifted the glass and drank
again.

Towards two o’clock he went into the garden and on to the tan-heap to
watch for the raven. He had not been there long before he began to feel
so tired that his limbs seemed hardly able to support him, and he could
not stand upright any longer; so again he lay down and fell fast asleep.
As the raven drove along her four chestnut horses, she said sorrowfully
to herself, ‘I know he has fallen asleep.’ She went as before to look
for him, but he slept, and it was impossible to awaken him.

The following day the old woman said to him, ‘What is this? You are not
eating or drinking anything, do you want to kill yourself?’

He answered, ‘I may not and will not either eat or drink.’

But she put down the dish of food and the glass of wine in front of him,
and when he smelt the wine, he was unable to resist the temptation, and
took a deep draught.

When the hour came round again he went as usual on to the tan-heap in
the garden to await the king’s daughter, but he felt even more overcome
with weariness than on the two previous days, and throwing himself down,
he slept like a log. At two o’clock the raven could be seen approaching,
and this time her coachman and everything about her, as well as her
horses, were black.

She was sadder than ever as she drove along, and said mournfully, ‘I
know he has fallen asleep, and will not be able to set me free.’ She
found him sleeping heavily, and all her efforts to awaken him were of no
avail. Then she placed beside him a loaf, and some meat, and a flask
of wine, of such a kind, that however much he took of them, they would
never grow less. After that she drew a gold ring, on which her name was
engraved, off her finger, and put it upon one of his. Finally, she laid
a letter near him, in which, after giving him particulars of the food
and drink she had left for him, she finished with the following words:
‘I see that as long as you remain here you will never be able to set me
free; if, however, you still wish to do so, come to the golden castle
of Stromberg; this is well within your power to accomplish.’ She then
returned to her carriage and drove to the golden castle of Stromberg.

When the man awoke and found that he had been sleeping, he was grieved
at heart, and said, ‘She has no doubt been here and driven away again,
and it is now too late for me to save her.’ Then his eyes fell on the
things which were lying beside him; he read the letter, and knew from it
all that had happened. He rose up without delay, eager to start on his
way and to reach the castle of Stromberg, but he had no idea in which
direction he ought to go. He travelled about a long time in search of it
and came at last to a dark forest, through which he went on walking for
fourteen days and still could not find a way out. Once more the night
came on, and worn out he lay down under a bush and fell asleep. Again
the next day he pursued his way through the forest, and that evening,
thinking to rest again, he lay down as before, but he heard such a
howling and wailing that he found it impossible to sleep. He waited till
it was darker and people had begun to light up their houses, and then
seeing a little glimmer ahead of him, he went towards it.

He found that the light came from a house which looked smaller than
it really was, from the contrast of its height with that of an immense
giant who stood in front of it. He thought to himself, ‘If the giant
sees me going in, my life will not be worth much.’ However, after a
while he summoned up courage and went forward. When the giant saw him,
he called out, ‘It is lucky for that you have come, for I have not had
anything to eat for a long time. I can have you now for my supper.’ ‘I
would rather you let that alone,’ said the man, ‘for I do not willingly
give myself up to be eaten; if you are wanting food I have enough to
satisfy your hunger.’ ‘If that is so,’ replied the giant, ‘I will leave
you in peace; I only thought of eating you because I had nothing else.’

So they went indoors together and sat down, and the man brought out the
bread, meat, and wine, which although he had eaten and drunk of them,
were still unconsumed. The giant was pleased with the good cheer, and
ate and drank to his heart’s content. When he had finished his supper
the man asked him if he could direct him to the castle of Stromberg.
The giant said, ‘I will look on my map; on it are marked all the towns,
villages, and houses.’ So he fetched his map, and looked for the castle,
but could not find it. ‘Never mind,’ he said, ‘I have larger maps
upstairs in the cupboard, we will look on those,’ but they searched in
vain, for the castle was not marked even on these. The man now thought
he should like to continue his journey, but the giant begged him to
remain for a day or two longer until the return of his brother, who was
away in search of provisions. When the brother came home, they asked him
about the castle of Stromberg, and he told them he would look on his own
maps as soon as he had eaten and appeased his hunger. Accordingly, when
he had finished his supper, they all went up together to his room and
looked through his maps, but the castle was not to be found. Then he
fetched other older maps, and they went on looking for the castle until
at last they found it, but it was many thousand miles away. ‘How shall I
be able to get there?’ asked the man. ‘I have two hours to spare,’ said
the giant, ‘and I will carry you into the neighbourhood of the castle; I
must then return to look after the child who is in our care.’

The giant, thereupon, carried the man to within about a hundred leagues
of the castle, where he left him, saying, ‘You will be able to walk the
remainder of the way yourself.’ The man journeyed on day and night
till he reached the golden castle of Stromberg. He found it situated,
however, on a glass mountain, and looking up from the foot he saw the
enchanted maiden drive round her castle and then go inside. He was
overjoyed to see her, and longed to get to the top of the mountain, but
the sides were so slippery that every time he attempted to climb he
fell back again. When he saw that it was impossible to reach her, he was
greatly grieved, and said to himself, ‘I will remain here and wait for
her,’ so he built himself a little hut, and there he sat and watched for
a whole year, and every day he saw the king’s daughter driving round her
castle, but still was unable to get nearer to her.

Looking out from his hut one day he saw three robbers fighting and he
called out to them, ‘God be with you.’ They stopped when they heard the
call, but looking round and seeing nobody, they went on again with their
fighting, which now became more furious. ‘God be with you,’ he cried
again, and again they paused and looked about, but seeing no one went
back to their fighting. A third time he called out, ‘God be with you,’
and then thinking he should like to know the cause of dispute between
the three men, he went out and asked them why they were fighting so
angrily with one another. One of them said that he had found a stick,
and that he had but to strike it against any door through which he
wished to pass, and it immediately flew open. Another told him that he
had found a cloak which rendered its wearer invisible; and the third had
caught a horse which would carry its rider over any obstacle, and even
up the glass mountain. They had been unable to decide whether they
would keep together and have the things in common, or whether they would
separate. On hearing this, the man said, ‘I will give you something in
exchange for those three things; not money, for that I have not got,
but something that is of far more value. I must first, however, prove
whether all you have told me about your three things is true.’ The
robbers, therefore, made him get on the horse, and handed him the stick
and the cloak, and when he had put this round him he was no longer
visible. Then he fell upon them with the stick and beat them one after
another, crying, ‘There, you idle vagabonds, you have got what you
deserve; are you satisfied now!’

After this he rode up the glass mountain. When he reached the gate of
the castle, he found it closed, but he gave it a blow with his stick,
and it flew wide open at once and he passed through. He mounted the
steps and entered the room where the maiden was sitting, with a golden
goblet full of wine in front of her. She could not see him for he still
wore his cloak. He took the ring which she had given him off his finger,
and threw it into the goblet, so that it rang as it touched the bottom.
‘That is my own ring,’ she exclaimed, ‘and if that is so the man must
also be here who is coming to set me free.’

She sought for him about the castle, but could find him nowhere.
Meanwhile he had gone outside again and mounted his horse and thrown off
the cloak. When therefore she came to the castle gate she saw him, and
cried aloud for joy. Then he dismounted and took her in his arms; and
she kissed him, and said, ‘Now you have indeed set me free, and tomorrow
we will celebrate our marriage.’




THE GOLDEN GOOSE

There was a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was called
Dummling,[*] and was despised, mocked, and sneered at on every occasion.

It happened that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew wood,
and before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet cake and a
bottle of wine in order that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst.

When he entered the forest he met a little grey-haired old man who bade
him good day, and said: ‘Do give me a piece of cake out of your pocket,
and let me have a draught of your wine; I am so hungry and thirsty.’ But
the clever son answered: ‘If I give you my cake and wine, I shall have
none for myself; be off with you,’ and he left the little man standing
and went on.

But when he began to hew down a tree, it was not long before he made a
false stroke, and the axe cut him in the arm, so that he had to go home
and have it bound up. And this was the little grey man’s doing.

After this the second son went into the forest, and his mother gave him,
like the eldest, a cake and a bottle of wine. The little old grey man
met him likewise, and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink of wine.
But the second son, too, said sensibly enough: ‘What I give you will be
taken away from myself; be off!’ and he left the little man standing and
went on. His punishment, however, was not delayed; when he had made a
few blows at the tree he struck himself in the leg, so that he had to be
carried home.

Then Dummling said: ‘Father, do let me go and cut wood.’ The father
answered: ‘Your brothers have hurt themselves with it, leave it alone,
you do not understand anything about it.’ But Dummling begged so long
that at last he said: ‘Just go then, you will get wiser by hurting
yourself.’ His mother gave him a cake made with water and baked in the
cinders, and with it a bottle of sour beer.

When he came to the forest the little old grey man met him likewise,
and greeting him, said: ‘Give me a piece of your cake and a drink out
of your bottle; I am so hungry and thirsty.’ Dummling answered: ‘I have
only cinder-cake and sour beer; if that pleases you, we will sit
down and eat.’ So they sat down, and when Dummling pulled out his
cinder-cake, it was a fine sweet cake, and the sour beer had become good
wine. So they ate and drank, and after that the little man said: ‘Since
you have a good heart, and are willing to divide what you have, I will
give you good luck. There stands an old tree, cut it down, and you will
find something at the roots.’ Then the little man took leave of him.

Dummling went and cut down the tree, and when it fell there was a goose
sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold. He lifted her up, and
taking her with him, went to an inn where he thought he would stay the
night. Now the host had three daughters, who saw the goose and were
curious to know what such a wonderful bird might be, and would have
liked to have one of its golden feathers.

The eldest thought: ‘I shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out a
feather,’ and as soon as Dummling had gone out she seized the goose by
the wing, but her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it.

The second came soon afterwards, thinking only of how she might get a
feather for herself, but she had scarcely touched her sister than she
was held fast.

At last the third also came with the like intent, and the others
screamed out: ‘Keep away; for goodness’ sake keep away!’ But she did
not understand why she was to keep away. ‘The others are there,’ she
thought, ‘I may as well be there too,’ and ran to them; but as soon as
she had touched her sister, she remained sticking fast to her. So they
had to spend the night with the goose.

The next morning Dummling took the goose under his arm and set out,
without troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on to
it. They were obliged to run after him continually, now left, now right,
wherever his legs took him.

In the middle of the fields the parson met them, and when he saw the
procession he said: ‘For shame, you good-for-nothing girls, why are you
running across the fields after this young man? Is that seemly?’ At the
same time he seized the youngest by the hand in order to pull her away,
but as soon as he touched her he likewise stuck fast, and was himself
obliged to run behind.

Before long the sexton came by and saw his master, the parson, running
behind three girls. He was astonished at this and called out: ‘Hi!
your reverence, whither away so quickly? Do not forget that we have a
christening today!’ and running after him he took him by the sleeve, but
was also held fast to it.

Whilst the five were trotting thus one behind the other, two labourers
came with their hoes from the fields; the parson called out to them
and begged that they would set him and the sexton free. But they had
scarcely touched the sexton when they were held fast, and now there were
seven of them running behind Dummling and the goose.

Soon afterwards he came to a city, where a king ruled who had a daughter
who was so serious that no one could make her laugh. So he had put forth
a decree that whosoever should be able to make her laugh should marry
her. When Dummling heard this, he went with his goose and all her train
before the king’s daughter, and as soon as she saw the seven people
running on and on, one behind the other, she began to laugh quite
loudly, and as if she would never stop. Thereupon Dummling asked to have
her for his wife; but the king did not like the son-in-law, and made all
manner of excuses and said he must first produce a man who could drink
a cellarful of wine. Dummling thought of the little grey man, who could
certainly help him; so he went into the forest, and in the same place
where he had felled the tree, he saw a man sitting, who had a very
sorrowful face. Dummling asked him what he was taking to heart so
sorely, and he answered: ‘I have such a great thirst and cannot quench
it; cold water I cannot stand, a barrel of wine I have just emptied, but
that to me is like a drop on a hot stone!’

‘There, I can help you,’ said Dummling, ‘just come with me and you shall
be satisfied.’

He led him into the king’s cellar, and the man bent over the huge
barrels, and drank and drank till his loins hurt, and before the day was
out he had emptied all the barrels. Then Dummling asked once more
for his bride, but the king was vexed that such an ugly fellow, whom
everyone called Dummling, should take away his daughter, and he made a
new condition; he must first find a man who could eat a whole mountain
of bread. Dummling did not think long, but went straight into the
forest, where in the same place there sat a man who was tying up his
body with a strap, and making an awful face, and saying: ‘I have eaten a
whole ovenful of rolls, but what good is that when one has such a hunger
as I? My stomach remains empty, and I must tie myself up if I am not to
die of hunger.’

At this Dummling was glad, and said: ‘Get up and come with me; you shall
eat yourself full.’ He led him to the king’s palace where all the
flour in the whole Kingdom was collected, and from it he caused a huge
mountain of bread to be baked. The man from the forest stood before it,
began to eat, and by the end of one day the whole mountain had vanished.
Then Dummling for the third time asked for his bride; but the king again
sought a way out, and ordered a ship which could sail on land and on
water. ‘As soon as you come sailing back in it,’ said he, ‘you shall
have my daughter for wife.’

Dummling went straight into the forest, and there sat the little grey
man to whom he had given his cake. When he heard what Dummling wanted,
he said: ‘Since you have given me to eat and to drink, I will give you
the ship; and I do all this because you once were kind to me.’ Then he
gave him the ship which could sail on land and water, and when the king
saw that, he could no longer prevent him from having his daughter. The
wedding was celebrated, and after the king’s death, Dummling inherited
his kingdom and lived for a long time contentedly with his wife.

THE WATER OF LIFE

Long before you or I were born, there reigned, in a country a great way
off, a king who had three sons. This king once fell very ill--so ill
that nobody thought he could live. His sons were very much grieved
at their father’s sickness; and as they were walking together very
mournfully in the garden of the palace, a little old man met them and
asked what was the matter. They told him that their father was very ill,
and that they were afraid nothing could save him. ‘I know what would,’
said the little old man; ‘it is the Water of Life. If he could have a
draught of it he would be well again; but it is very hard to get.’ Then
the eldest son said, ‘I will soon find it’: and he went to the sick
king, and begged that he might go in search of the Water of Life, as
it was the only thing that could save him. ‘No,’ said the king. ‘I had
rather die than place you in such great danger as you must meet with in
your journey.’ But he begged so hard that the king let him go; and the
prince thought to himself, ‘If I bring my father this water, he will
make me sole heir to his kingdom.’

Then he set out: and when he had gone on his way some time he came to a
deep valley, overhung with rocks and woods; and as he looked around, he
saw standing above him on one of the rocks a little ugly dwarf, with a
sugarloaf cap and a scarlet cloak; and the dwarf called to him and said,
‘Prince, whither so fast?’ ‘What is that to thee, you ugly imp?’ said
the prince haughtily, and rode on.

But the dwarf was enraged at his behaviour, and laid a fairy spell
of ill-luck upon him; so that as he rode on the mountain pass became
narrower and narrower, and at last the way was so straitened that he
could not go to step forward: and when he thought to have turned his
horse round and go back the way he came, he heard a loud laugh ringing
round him, and found that the path was closed behind him, so that he was
shut in all round. He next tried to get off his horse and make his way
on foot, but again the laugh rang in his ears, and he found himself
unable to move a step, and thus he was forced to abide spellbound.

Meantime the old king was lingering on in daily hope of his son’s
return, till at last the second son said, ‘Father, I will go in search
of the Water of Life.’ For he thought to himself, ‘My brother is surely
dead, and the kingdom will fall to me if I find the water.’ The king was
at first very unwilling to let him go, but at last yielded to his wish.
So he set out and followed the same road which his brother had done,
and met with the same elf, who stopped him at the same spot in the
mountains, saying, as before, ‘Prince, prince, whither so fast?’ ‘Mind
your own affairs, busybody!’ said the prince scornfully, and rode on.

But the dwarf put the same spell upon him as he put on his elder
brother, and he, too, was at last obliged to take up his abode in the
heart of the mountains. Thus it is with proud silly people, who think
themselves above everyone else, and are too proud to ask or take advice.

When the second prince had thus been gone a long time, the youngest son
said he would go and search for the Water of Life, and trusted he should
soon be able to make his father well again. So he set out, and the dwarf
met him too at the same spot in the valley, among the mountains, and
said, ‘Prince, whither so fast?’ And the prince said, ‘I am going in
search of the Water of Life, because my father is ill, and like to die:
can you help me? Pray be kind, and aid me if you can!’ ‘Do you know
where it is to be found?’ asked the dwarf. ‘No,’ said the prince, ‘I do
not. Pray tell me if you know.’ ‘Then as you have spoken to me kindly,
and are wise enough to seek for advice, I will tell you how and where to
go. The water you seek springs from a well in an enchanted castle; and,
that you may be able to reach it in safety, I will give you an iron wand
and two little loaves of bread; strike the iron door of the castle three
times with the wand, and it will open: two hungry lions will be lying
down inside gaping for their prey, but if you throw them the bread they
will let you pass; then hasten on to the well, and take some of the
Water of Life before the clock strikes twelve; for if you tarry longer
the door will shut upon you for ever.’

Then the prince thanked his little friend with the scarlet cloak for his
friendly aid, and took the wand and the bread, and went travelling on
and on, over sea and over land, till he came to his journey’s end, and
found everything to be as the dwarf had told him. The door flew open at
the third stroke of the wand, and when the lions were quieted he went on
through the castle and came at length to a beautiful hall. Around it he
saw several knights sitting in a trance; then he pulled off their rings
and put them on his own fingers. In another room he saw on a table a
sword and a loaf of bread, which he also took. Further on he came to a
room where a beautiful young lady sat upon a couch; and she welcomed him
joyfully, and said, if he would set her free from the spell that bound
her, the kingdom should be his, if he would come back in a year and
marry her. Then she told him that the well that held the Water of Life
was in the palace gardens; and bade him make haste, and draw what he
wanted before the clock struck twelve.

He walked on; and as he walked through beautiful gardens he came to a
delightful shady spot in which stood a couch; and he thought to himself,
as he felt tired, that he would rest himself for a while, and gaze on
the lovely scenes around him. So he laid himself down, and sleep
fell upon him unawares, so that he did not wake up till the clock was
striking a quarter to twelve. Then he sprang from the couch dreadfully
frightened, ran to the well, filled a cup that was standing by him full
of water, and hastened to get away in time. Just as he was going out of
the iron door it struck twelve, and the door fell so quickly upon him
that it snapped off a piece of his heel.

When he found himself safe, he was overjoyed to think that he had got
the Water of Life; and as he was going on his way homewards, he passed
by the little dwarf, who, when he saw the sword and the loaf, said, ‘You
have made a noble prize; with the sword you can at a blow slay whole
armies, and the bread will never fail you.’ Then the prince thought
to himself, ‘I cannot go home to my father without my brothers’; so he
said, ‘My dear friend, cannot you tell me where my two brothers are, who
set out in search of the Water of Life before me, and never came back?’
‘I have shut them up by a charm between two mountains,’ said the dwarf,
‘because they were proud and ill-behaved, and scorned to ask advice.’
The prince begged so hard for his brothers, that the dwarf at last set
them free, though unwillingly, saying, ‘Beware of them, for they have
bad hearts.’ Their brother, however, was greatly rejoiced to see them,
and told them all that had happened to him; how he had found the Water
of Life, and had taken a cup full of it; and how he had set a beautiful
princess free from a spell that bound her; and how she had engaged to
wait a whole year, and then to marry him, and to give him the kingdom.

Then they all three rode on together, and on their way home came to a
country that was laid waste by war and a dreadful famine, so that it was
feared all must die for want. But the prince gave the king of the land
the bread, and all his kingdom ate of it. And he lent the king the
wonderful sword, and he slew the enemy’s army with it; and thus the
kingdom was once more in peace and plenty. In the same manner he
befriended two other countries through which they passed on their way.

When they came to the sea, they got into a ship and during their voyage
the two eldest said to themselves, ‘Our brother has got the water which
we could not find, therefore our father will forsake us and give him the
kingdom, which is our right’; so they were full of envy and revenge, and
agreed together how they could ruin him. Then they waited till he was
fast asleep, and poured the Water of Life out of the cup, and took it
for themselves, giving him bitter sea-water instead.

When they came to their journey’s end, the youngest son brought his cup
to the sick king, that he might drink and be healed. Scarcely, however,
had he tasted the bitter sea-water when he became worse even than he was
before; and then both the elder sons came in, and blamed the youngest
for what they had done; and said that he wanted to poison their father,
but that they had found the Water of Life, and had brought it with them.
He no sooner began to drink of what they brought him, than he felt his
sickness leave him, and was as strong and well as in his younger days.
Then they went to their brother, and laughed at him, and said, ‘Well,
brother, you found the Water of Life, did you? You have had the trouble
and we shall have the reward. Pray, with all your cleverness, why did
not you manage to keep your eyes open? Next year one of us will take
away your beautiful princess, if you do not take care. You had better
say nothing about this to our father, for he does not believe a word you
say; and if you tell tales, you shall lose your life into the bargain:
but be quiet, and we will let you off.’

The old king was still very angry with his youngest son, and thought
that he really meant to have taken away his life; so he called his court
together, and asked what should be done, and all agreed that he ought to
be put to death. The prince knew nothing of what was going on, till one
day, when the king’s chief huntsmen went a-hunting with him, and they
were alone in the wood together, the huntsman looked so sorrowful that
the prince said, ‘My friend, what is the matter with you?’ ‘I cannot and
dare not tell you,’ said he. But the prince begged very hard, and said,
‘Only tell me what it is, and do not think I shall be angry, for I will
forgive you.’ ‘Alas!’ said the huntsman; ‘the king has ordered me to
shoot you.’ The prince started at this, and said, ‘Let me live, and I
will change dresses with you; you shall take my royal coat to show to my
father, and do you give me your shabby one.’ ‘With all my heart,’ said
the huntsman; ‘I am sure I shall be glad to save you, for I could not
have shot you.’ Then he took the prince’s coat, and gave him the shabby
one, and went away through the wood.

Some time after, three grand embassies came to the old king’s court,
with rich gifts of gold and precious stones for his youngest son; now
all these were sent from the three kings to whom he had lent his sword
and loaf of bread, in order to rid them of their enemy and feed their
people. This touched the old king’s heart, and he thought his son might
still be guiltless, and said to his court, ‘O that my son were still
alive! how it grieves me that I had him killed!’ ‘He is still alive,’
said the huntsman; ‘and I am glad that I had pity on him, but let him
go in peace, and brought home his royal coat.’ At this the king was
overwhelmed with joy, and made it known throughout all his kingdom, that
if his son would come back to his court he would forgive him.

Meanwhile the princess was eagerly waiting till her deliverer should
come back; and had a road made leading up to her palace all of shining
gold; and told her courtiers that whoever came on horseback, and rode
straight up to the gate upon it, was her true lover; and that they must
let him in: but whoever rode on one side of it, they must be sure was
not the right one; and that they must send him away at once.

The time soon came, when the eldest brother thought that he would make
haste to go to the princess, and say that he was the one who had set
her free, and that he should have her for his wife, and the kingdom with
her. As he came before the palace and saw the golden road, he stopped to
look at it, and he thought to himself, ‘It is a pity to ride upon this
beautiful road’; so he turned aside and rode on the right-hand side of
it. But when he came to the gate, the guards, who had seen the road
he took, said to him, he could not be what he said he was, and must go
about his business.

The second prince set out soon afterwards on the same errand; and when
he came to the golden road, and his horse had set one foot upon it,
he stopped to look at it, and thought it very beautiful, and said to
himself, ‘What a pity it is that anything should tread here!’ Then he
too turned aside and rode on the left side of it. But when he came to
the gate the guards said he was not the true prince, and that he too
must go away about his business; and away he went.

Now when the full year was come round, the third brother left the forest
in which he had lain hid for fear of his father’s anger, and set out in
search of his betrothed bride. So he journeyed on, thinking of her all
the way, and rode so quickly that he did not even see what the road was
made of, but went with his horse straight over it; and as he came to the
gate it flew open, and the princess welcomed him with joy, and said
he was her deliverer, and should now be her husband and lord of the
kingdom. When the first joy at their meeting was over, the princess told
him she had heard of his father having forgiven him, and of his wish to
have him home again: so, before his wedding with the princess, he went
to visit his father, taking her with him. Then he told him everything;
how his brothers had cheated and robbed him, and yet that he had borne
all those wrongs for the love of his father. And the old king was very
angry, and wanted to punish his wicked sons; but they made their escape,
and got into a ship and sailed away over the wide sea, and where they
went to nobody knew and nobody cared.

And now the old king gathered together his court, and asked all his
kingdom to come and celebrate the wedding of his son and the princess.
And young and old, noble and squire, gentle and simple, came at once
on the summons; and among the rest came the friendly dwarf, with the
sugarloaf hat, and a new scarlet cloak.

And the wedding was held, and the merry bells run.
And all the good people they danced and they sung,
And feasted and frolick’d I can’t tell how long.




THE TWELVE HUNTSMEN

There was once a king’s son who had a bride whom he loved very much. And
when he was sitting beside her and very happy, news came that his father
lay sick unto death, and desired to see him once again before his end.
Then he said to his beloved: ‘I must now go and leave you, I give you
a ring as a remembrance of me. When I am king, I will return and fetch
you.’ So he rode away, and when he reached his father, the latter was
dangerously ill, and near his death. He said to him: ‘Dear son, I wished
to see you once again before my end, promise me to marry as I wish,’ and
he named a certain king’s daughter who was to be his wife. The son was
in such trouble that he did not think what he was doing, and said: ‘Yes,
dear father, your will shall be done,’ and thereupon the king shut his
eyes, and died.

When therefore the son had been proclaimed king, and the time of
mourning was over, he was forced to keep the promise which he had given
his father, and caused the king’s daughter to be asked in marriage, and
she was promised to him. His first betrothed heard of this, and fretted
so much about his faithfulness that she nearly died. Then her father
said to her: ‘Dearest child, why are you so sad? You shall have
whatsoever you will.’ She thought for a moment and said: ‘Dear father,
I wish for eleven girls exactly like myself in face, figure, and size.’
The father said: ‘If it be possible, your desire shall be fulfilled,’
and he caused a search to be made in his whole kingdom, until eleven
young maidens were found who exactly resembled his daughter in face,
figure, and size.

When they came to the king’s daughter, she had twelve suits of
huntsmen’s clothes made, all alike, and the eleven maidens had to put
on the huntsmen’s clothes, and she herself put on the twelfth suit.
Thereupon she took her leave of her father, and rode away with them,
and rode to the court of her former betrothed, whom she loved so dearly.
Then she asked if he required any huntsmen, and if he would take all of
them into his service. The king looked at her and did not know her, but
as they were such handsome fellows, he said: ‘Yes,’ and that he would
willingly take them, and now they were the king’s twelve huntsmen.

The king, however, had a lion which was a wondrous animal, for he knew
all concealed and secret things. It came to pass that one evening he
said to the king: ‘You think you have twelve huntsmen?’ ‘Yes,’ said the
king, ‘they are twelve huntsmen.’ The lion continued: ‘You are mistaken,
they are twelve girls.’ The king said: ‘That cannot be true! How
will you prove that to me?’ ‘Oh, just let some peas be strewn in the
ante-chamber,’ answered the lion, ‘and then you will soon see. Men have
a firm step, and when they walk over peas none of them stir, but girls
trip and skip, and drag their feet, and the peas roll about.’ The king
was well pleased with the counsel, and caused the peas to be strewn.

There was, however, a servant of the king’s who favoured the huntsmen,
and when he heard that they were going to be put to this test he went to
them and repeated everything, and said: ‘The lion wants to make the king
believe that you are girls.’ Then the king’s daughter thanked him, and
said to her maidens: ‘Show some strength, and step firmly on the peas.’
So next morning when the king had the twelve huntsmen called before
him, and they came into the ante-chamber where the peas were lying, they
stepped so firmly on them, and had such a strong, sure walk, that not
one of the peas either rolled or stirred. Then they went away again,
and the king said to the lion: ‘You have lied to me, they walk just like
men.’ The lion said: ‘They have been informed that they were going to
be put to the test, and have assumed some strength. Just let twelve
spinning-wheels be brought into the ante-chamber, and they will go to
them and be pleased with them, and that is what no man would do.’
The king liked the advice, and had the spinning-wheels placed in the
ante-chamber.

But the servant, who was well disposed to the huntsmen, went to them,
and disclosed the project. So when they were alone the king’s daughter
said to her eleven girls: ‘Show some constraint, and do not look round
at the spinning-wheels.’ And next morning when the king had his twelve
huntsmen summoned, they went through the ante-chamber, and never once
looked at the spinning-wheels. Then the king again said to the lion:
‘You have deceived me, they are men, for they have not looked at the
spinning-wheels.’ The lion replied: ‘They have restrained themselves.’
The king, however, would no longer believe the lion.

The twelve huntsmen always followed the king to the chase, and his
liking for them continually increased. Now it came to pass that
once when they were out hunting, news came that the king’s bride was
approaching. When the true bride heard that, it hurt her so much that
her heart was almost broken, and she fell fainting to the ground. The
king thought something had happened to his dear huntsman, ran up to him,
wanted to help him, and drew his glove off. Then he saw the ring which
he had given to his first bride, and when he looked in her face he
recognized her. Then his heart was so touched that he kissed her, and
when she opened her eyes he said: ‘You are mine, and I am yours, and
no one in the world can alter that.’ He sent a messenger to the other
bride, and entreated her to return to her own kingdom, for he had a wife
already, and someone who had just found an old key did not require a new
one. Thereupon the wedding was celebrated, and the lion was again taken
into favour, because, after all, he had told the truth.




THE KING OF THE GOLDEN MOUNTAIN

There was once a merchant who had only one child, a son, that was very
young, and barely able to run alone. He had two richly laden ships then
making a voyage upon the seas, in which he had embarked all his wealth,
in the hope of making great gains, when the news came that both were
lost. Thus from being a rich man he became all at once so very poor that
nothing was left to him but one small plot of land; and there he often
went in an evening to take his walk, and ease his mind of a little of
his trouble.

One day, as he was roaming along in a brown study, thinking with no
great comfort on what he had been and what he now was, and was like
to be, all on a sudden there stood before him a little, rough-looking,
black dwarf. ‘Prithee, friend, why so sorrowful?’ said he to the
merchant; ‘what is it you take so deeply to heart?’ ‘If you would do me
any good I would willingly tell you,’ said the merchant. ‘Who knows but
I may?’ said the little man: ‘tell me what ails you, and perhaps you
will find I may be of some use.’ Then the merchant told him how all his
wealth was gone to the bottom of the sea, and how he had nothing left
but that little plot of land. ‘Oh, trouble not yourself about that,’
said the dwarf; ‘only undertake to bring me here, twelve years hence,
whatever meets you first on your going home, and I will give you as much
as you please.’ The merchant thought this was no great thing to ask;
that it would most likely be his dog or his cat, or something of that
sort, but forgot his little boy Heinel; so he agreed to the bargain, and
signed and sealed the bond to do what was asked of him.

But as he drew near home, his little boy was so glad to see him that he
crept behind him, and laid fast hold of his legs, and looked up in
his face and laughed. Then the father started, trembling with fear and
horror, and saw what it was that he had bound himself to do; but as no
gold was come, he made himself easy by thinking that it was only a joke
that the dwarf was playing him, and that, at any rate, when the money
came, he should see the bearer, and would not take it in.

About a month afterwards he went upstairs into a lumber-room to look
for some old iron, that he might sell it and raise a little money; and
there, instead of his iron, he saw a large pile of gold lying on the
floor. At the sight of this he was overjoyed, and forgetting all about
his son, went into trade again, and became a richer merchant than
before.

Meantime little Heinel grew up, and as the end of the twelve years drew
near the merchant began to call to mind his bond, and became very sad
and thoughtful; so that care and sorrow were written upon his face. The
boy one day asked what was the matter, but his father would not tell for
some time; at last, however, he said that he had, without knowing it,
sold him for gold to a little, ugly-looking, black dwarf, and that the
twelve years were coming round when he must keep his word. Then Heinel
said, ‘Father, give yourself very little trouble about that; I shall be
too much for the little man.’

When the time came, the father and son went out together to the place
agreed upon: and the son drew a circle on the ground, and set himself
and his father in the middle of it. The little black dwarf soon came,
and walked round and round about the circle, but could not find any way
to get into it, and he either could not, or dared not, jump over it. At
last the boy said to him. ‘Have you anything to say to us, my friend, or
what do you want?’ Now Heinel had found a friend in a good fairy, that
was fond of him, and had told him what to do; for this fairy knew what
good luck was in store for him. ‘Have you brought me what you said you
would?’ said the dwarf to the merchant. The old man held his tongue, but
Heinel said again, ‘What do you want here?’ The dwarf said, ‘I come to
talk with your father, not with you.’ ‘You have cheated and taken in my
father,’ said the son; ‘pray give him up his bond at once.’ ‘Fair and
softly,’ said the little old man; ‘right is right; I have paid my money,
and your father has had it, and spent it; so be so good as to let me
have what I paid it for.’ ‘You must have my consent to that first,’ said
Heinel, ‘so please to step in here, and let us talk it over.’ The old
man grinned, and showed his teeth, as if he should have been very glad
to get into the circle if he could. Then at last, after a long talk,
they came to terms. Heinel agreed that his father must give him up, and
that so far the dwarf should have his way: but, on the other hand, the
fairy had told Heinel what fortune was in store for him, if he followed
his own course; and he did not choose to be given up to his hump-backed
friend, who seemed so anxious for his company.

So, to make a sort of drawn battle of the matter, it was settled that
Heinel should be put into an open boat, that lay on the sea-shore hard
by; that the father should push him off with his own hand, and that he
should thus be set adrift, and left to the bad or good luck of wind and
weather. Then he took leave of his father, and set himself in the boat,
but before it got far off a wave struck it, and it fell with one side
low in the water, so the merchant thought that poor Heinel was lost, and
went home very sorrowful, while the dwarf went his way, thinking that at
any rate he had had his revenge.

The boat, however, did not sink, for the good fairy took care of her
friend, and soon raised the boat up again, and it went safely on. The
young man sat safe within, till at length it ran ashore upon an unknown
land. As he jumped upon the shore he saw before him a beautiful castle
but empty and dreary within, for it was enchanted. ‘Here,’ said he to
himself, ‘must I find the prize the good fairy told me of.’ So he once
more searched the whole palace through, till at last he found a white
snake, lying coiled up on a cushion in one of the chambers.

Now the white snake was an enchanted princess; and she was very glad
to see him, and said, ‘Are you at last come to set me free? Twelve
long years have I waited here for the fairy to bring you hither as she
promised, for you alone can save me. This night twelve men will come:
their faces will be black, and they will be dressed in chain armour.
They will ask what you do here, but give no answer; and let them do
what they will--beat, whip, pinch, prick, or torment you--bear all; only
speak not a word, and at twelve o’clock they must go away. The second
night twelve others will come: and the third night twenty-four, who
will even cut off your head; but at the twelfth hour of that night their
power is gone, and I shall be free, and will come and bring you the
Water of Life, and will wash you with it, and bring you back to life
and health.’ And all came to pass as she had said; Heinel bore all, and
spoke not a word; and the third night the princess came, and fell on his
neck and kissed him. Joy and gladness burst forth throughout the castle,
the wedding was celebrated, and he was crowned king of the Golden
Mountain.

They lived together very happily, and the queen had a son. And thus
eight years had passed over their heads, when the king thought of his
father; and he began to long to see him once again. But the queen was
against his going, and said, ‘I know well that misfortunes will come
upon us if you go.’ However, he gave her no rest till she agreed. At his
going away she gave him a wishing-ring, and said, ‘Take this ring, and
put it on your finger; whatever you wish it will bring you; only promise
never to make use of it to bring me hence to your father’s house.’ Then
he said he would do what she asked, and put the ring on his finger, and
wished himself near the town where his father lived.

Heinel found himself at the gates in a moment; but the guards would
not let him go in, because he was so strangely clad. So he went up to a
neighbouring hill, where a shepherd dwelt, and borrowed his old frock,
and thus passed unknown into the town. When he came to his father’s
house, he said he was his son; but the merchant would not believe him,
and said he had had but one son, his poor Heinel, who he knew was long
since dead: and as he was only dressed like a poor shepherd, he would
not even give him anything to eat. The king, however, still vowed that
he was his son, and said, ‘Is there no mark by which you would know me
if I am really your son?’ ‘Yes,’ said his mother, ‘our Heinel had a mark
like a raspberry on his right arm.’ Then he showed them the mark, and
they knew that what he had said was true.

He next told them how he was king of the Golden Mountain, and was
married to a princess, and had a son seven years old. But the merchant
said, ‘that can never be true; he must be a fine king truly who travels
about in a shepherd’s frock!’ At this the son was vexed; and forgetting
his word, turned his ring, and wished for his queen and son. In an
instant they stood before him; but the queen wept, and said he had
broken his word, and bad luck would follow. He did all he could to
soothe her, and she at last seemed to be appeased; but she was not so in
truth, and was only thinking how she should punish him.

One day he took her to walk with him out of the town, and showed her
the spot where the boat was set adrift upon the wide waters. Then he sat
himself down, and said, ‘I am very much tired; sit by me, I will rest my
head in your lap, and sleep a while.’ As soon as he had fallen asleep,
however, she drew the ring from his finger, and crept softly away, and
wished herself and her son at home in their kingdom. And when he awoke
he found himself alone, and saw that the ring was gone from his finger.
‘I can never go back to my father’s house,’ said he; ‘they would say I
am a sorcerer: I will journey forth into the world, till I come again to
my kingdom.’

So saying he set out and travelled till he came to a hill, where three
giants were sharing their father’s goods; and as they saw him pass they
cried out and said, ‘Little men have sharp wits; he shall part the goods
between us.’ Now there was a sword that cut off an enemy’s head whenever
the wearer gave the words, ‘Heads off!’; a cloak that made the owner
invisible, or gave him any form he pleased; and a pair of boots that
carried the wearer wherever he wished. Heinel said they must first let
him try these wonderful things, then he might know how to set a value
upon them. Then they gave him the cloak, and he wished himself a fly,
and in a moment he was a fly. ‘The cloak is very well,’ said he: ‘now
give me the sword.’ ‘No,’ said they; ‘not unless you undertake not to
say, “Heads off!” for if you do we are all dead men.’ So they gave it
him, charging him to try it on a tree. He next asked for the boots also;
and the moment he had all three in his power, he wished himself at
the Golden Mountain; and there he was at once. So the giants were left
behind with no goods to share or quarrel about.

As Heinel came near his castle he heard the sound of merry music; and
the people around told him that his queen was about to marry another
husband. Then he threw his cloak around him, and passed through the
castle hall, and placed himself by the side of the queen, where no one
saw him. But when anything to eat was put upon her plate, he took it
away and ate it himself; and when a glass of wine was handed to her, he
took it and drank it; and thus, though they kept on giving her meat and
drink, her plate and cup were always empty.

Upon this, fear and remorse came over her, and she went into her chamber
alone, and sat there weeping; and he followed her there. ‘Alas!’ said
she to herself, ‘was I not once set free? Why then does this enchantment
still seem to bind me?’

‘False and fickle one!’ said he. ‘One indeed came who set thee free, and
he is now near thee again; but how have you used him? Ought he to
have had such treatment from thee?’ Then he went out and sent away the
company, and said the wedding was at an end, for that he was come back
to the kingdom. But the princes, peers, and great men mocked at him.
However, he would enter into no parley with them, but only asked them
if they would go in peace or not. Then they turned upon him and tried
to seize him; but he drew his sword. ‘Heads Off!’ cried he; and with the
word the traitors’ heads fell before him, and Heinel was once more king
of the Golden Mountain.




DOCTOR KNOWALL

There was once upon a time a poor peasant called Crabb, who drove with
two oxen a load of wood to the town, and sold it to a doctor for two
talers. When the money was being counted out to him, it so happened that
the doctor was sitting at table, and when the peasant saw how well he
ate and drank, his heart desired what he saw, and would willingly
have been a doctor too. So he remained standing a while, and at length
inquired if he too could not be a doctor. ‘Oh, yes,’ said the doctor,
‘that is soon managed.’ ‘What must I do?’ asked the peasant. ‘In the
first place buy yourself an A B C book of the kind which has a cock on
the frontispiece; in the second, turn your cart and your two oxen into
money, and get yourself some clothes, and whatsoever else pertains to
medicine; thirdly, have a sign painted for yourself with the words: “I
am Doctor Knowall,” and have that nailed up above your house-door.’ The
peasant did everything that he had been told to do. When he had doctored
people awhile, but not long, a rich and great lord had some money
stolen. Then he was told about Doctor Knowall who lived in such and such
a village, and must know what had become of the money. So the lord had
the horses harnessed to his carriage, drove out to the village, and
asked Crabb if he were Doctor Knowall. Yes, he was, he said. Then he was
to go with him and bring back the stolen money. ‘Oh, yes, but Grete, my
wife, must go too.’ The lord was willing, and let both of them have a
seat in the carriage, and they all drove away together. When they came
to the nobleman’s castle, the table was spread, and Crabb was told to
sit down and eat. ‘Yes, but my wife, Grete, too,’ said he, and he seated
himself with her at the table. And when the first servant came with a
dish of delicate fare, the peasant nudged his wife, and said: ‘Grete,
that was the first,’ meaning that was the servant who brought the first
dish. The servant, however, thought he intended by that to say: ‘That is
the first thief,’ and as he actually was so, he was terrified, and said
to his comrade outside: ‘The doctor knows all: we shall fare ill, he
said I was the first.’ The second did not want to go in at all, but was
forced. So when he went in with his dish, the peasant nudged his wife,
and said: ‘Grete, that is the second.’ This servant was equally alarmed,
and he got out as fast as he could. The third fared no better, for the
peasant again said: ‘Grete, that is the third.’ The fourth had to carry
in a dish that was covered, and the lord told the doctor that he was to
show his skill, and guess what was beneath the cover. Actually, there
were crabs. The doctor looked at the dish, had no idea what to say, and
cried: ‘Ah, poor Crabb.’ When the lord heard that, he cried: ‘There! he
knows it; he must also know who has the money!’

On this the servants looked terribly uneasy, and made a sign to the
doctor that they wished him to step outside for a moment. When therefore
he went out, all four of them confessed to him that they had stolen
the money, and said that they would willingly restore it and give him a
heavy sum into the bargain, if he would not denounce them, for if he
did they would be hanged. They led him to the spot where the money was
concealed. With this the doctor was satisfied, and returned to the hall,
sat down to the table, and said: ‘My lord, now will I search in my book
where the gold is hidden.’ The fifth servant, however, crept into the
stove to hear if the doctor knew still more. But the doctor sat still
and opened his A B C book, turned the pages backwards and forwards, and
looked for the cock. As he could not find it immediately he said: ‘I
know you are there, so you had better come out!’ Then the fellow in the
stove thought that the doctor meant him, and full of terror, sprang out,
crying: ‘That man knows everything!’ Then Doctor Knowall showed the lord
where the money was, but did not say who had stolen it, and received
from both sides much money in reward, and became a renowned man.




THE SEVEN RAVENS

There was once a man who had seven sons, and last of all one daughter.
Although the little girl was very pretty, she was so weak and small that
they thought she could not live; but they said she should at once be
christened.

So the father sent one of his sons in haste to the spring to get some
water, but the other six ran with him. Each wanted to be first at
drawing the water, and so they were in such a hurry that all let their
pitchers fall into the well, and they stood very foolishly looking at
one another, and did not know what to do, for none dared go home. In the
meantime the father was uneasy, and could not tell what made the
young men stay so long. ‘Surely,’ said he, ‘the whole seven must have
forgotten themselves over some game of play’; and when he had waited
still longer and they yet did not come, he flew into a rage and wished
them all turned into ravens. Scarcely had he spoken these words when he
heard a croaking over his head, and looked up and saw seven ravens as
black as coal flying round and round. Sorry as he was to see his wish
so fulfilled, he did not know how what was done could be undone, and
comforted himself as well as he could for the loss of his seven sons
with his dear little daughter, who soon became stronger and every day
more beautiful.

For a long time she did not know that she had ever had any brothers; for
her father and mother took care not to speak of them before her: but one
day by chance she heard the people about her speak of them. ‘Yes,’ said
they, ‘she is beautiful indeed, but still ‘tis a pity that her brothers
should have been lost for her sake.’ Then she was much grieved, and went
to her father and mother, and asked if she had any brothers, and what
had become of them. So they dared no longer hide the truth from her, but
said it was the will of Heaven, and that her birth was only the innocent
cause of it; but the little girl mourned sadly about it every day, and
thought herself bound to do all she could to bring her brothers back;
and she had neither rest nor ease, till at length one day she stole
away, and set out into the wide world to find her brothers, wherever
they might be, and free them, whatever it might cost her.

She took nothing with her but a little ring which her father and mother
had given her, a loaf of bread in case she should be hungry, a little
pitcher of water in case she should be thirsty, and a little stool
to rest upon when she should be weary. Thus she went on and on, and
journeyed till she came to the world’s end; then she came to the sun,
but the sun looked much too hot and fiery; so she ran away quickly to
the moon, but the moon was cold and chilly, and said, ‘I smell flesh
and blood this way!’ so she took herself away in a hurry and came to the
stars, and the stars were friendly and kind to her, and each star sat
upon his own little stool; but the morning star rose up and gave her a
little piece of wood, and said, ‘If you have not this little piece of
wood, you cannot unlock the castle that stands on the glass-mountain,
and there your brothers live.’ The little girl took the piece of wood,
rolled it up in a little cloth, and went on again until she came to the
glass-mountain, and found the door shut. Then she felt for the little
piece of wood; but when she unwrapped the cloth it was not there, and
she saw she had lost the gift of the good stars. What was to be done?
She wanted to save her brothers, and had no key of the castle of the
glass-mountain; so this faithful little sister took a knife out of her
pocket and cut off her little finger, that was just the size of the
piece of wood she had lost, and put it in the door and opened it.

As she went in, a little dwarf came up to her, and said, ‘What are you
seeking for?’ ‘I seek for my brothers, the seven ravens,’ answered she.
Then the dwarf said, ‘My masters are not at home; but if you will wait
till they come, pray step in.’ Now the little dwarf was getting their
dinner ready, and he brought their food upon seven little plates, and
their drink in seven little glasses, and set them upon the table, and
out of each little plate their sister ate a small piece, and out of each
little glass she drank a small drop; but she let the ring that she had
brought with her fall into the last glass.

On a sudden she heard a fluttering and croaking in the air, and the
dwarf said, ‘Here come my masters.’ When they came in, they wanted to
eat and drink, and looked for their little plates and glasses. Then said
one after the other,

‘Who has eaten from my little plate? And who has been drinking out of my
little glass?’

‘Caw! Caw! well I ween
Mortal lips have this way been.’

When the seventh came to the bottom of his glass, and found there the
ring, he looked at it, and knew that it was his father’s and mother’s,
and said, ‘O that our little sister would but come! then we should be
free.’ When the little girl heard this (for she stood behind the door
all the time and listened), she ran forward, and in an instant all
the ravens took their right form again; and all hugged and kissed each
other, and went merrily home.




THE WEDDING OF MRS FOX


FIRST STORY

There was once upon a time an old fox with nine tails, who believed that
his wife was not faithful to him, and wished to put her to the test. He
stretched himself out under the bench, did not move a limb, and behaved
as if he were stone dead. Mrs Fox went up to her room, shut herself in,
and her maid, Miss Cat, sat by the fire, and did the cooking. When it
became known that the old fox was dead, suitors presented themselves.
The maid heard someone standing at the house-door, knocking. She went
and opened it, and it was a young fox, who said:

‘What may you be about, Miss Cat?
Do you sleep or do you wake?’

She answered:

‘I am not sleeping, I am waking,
Would you know what I am making?
I am boiling warm beer with butter,
Will you be my guest for supper?’

‘No, thank you, miss,’ said the fox, ‘what is Mrs Fox doing?’ The maid
replied:

‘She is sitting in her room,
Moaning in her gloom,
Weeping her little eyes quite red,
Because old Mr Fox is dead.’

‘Do just tell her, miss, that a young fox is here, who would like to woo
her.’ ‘Certainly, young sir.’

The cat goes up the stairs trip, trap,
The door she knocks at tap, tap, tap,
‘Mistress Fox, are you inside?’
‘Oh, yes, my little cat,’ she cried.
‘A wooer he stands at the door out there.’
‘What does he look like, my dear?’

‘Has he nine as beautiful tails as the late Mr Fox?’ ‘Oh, no,’ answered
the cat, ‘he has only one.’ ‘Then I will not have him.’

Miss Cat went downstairs and sent the wooer away. Soon afterwards there
was another knock, and another fox was at the door who wished to woo Mrs
Fox. He had two tails, but he did not fare better than the first. After
this still more came, each with one tail more than the other, but they
were all turned away, until at last one came who had nine tails, like
old Mr Fox. When the widow heard that, she said joyfully to the cat:

‘Now open the gates and doors all wide,
And carry old Mr Fox outside.’

But just as the wedding was going to be solemnized, old Mr Fox stirred
under the bench, and cudgelled all the rabble, and drove them and Mrs
Fox out of the house.


SECOND STORY

When old Mr Fox was dead, the wolf came as a suitor, and knocked at the
door, and the cat who was servant to Mrs Fox, opened it for him. The
wolf greeted her, and said:

‘Good day, Mrs Cat of Kehrewit,
How comes it that alone you sit?
What are you making good?’

The cat replied:

‘In milk I’m breaking bread so sweet,
Will you be my guest, and eat?’

‘No, thank you, Mrs Cat,’ answered the wolf. ‘Is Mrs Fox not at home?’

The cat said:

‘She sits upstairs in her room,
Bewailing her sorrowful doom,
Bewailing her trouble so sore,
For old Mr Fox is no more.’

The wolf answered:

‘If she’s in want of a husband now,
Then will it please her to step below?’
The cat runs quickly up the stair,
And lets her tail fly here and there,
Until she comes to the parlour door.
With her five gold rings at the door she knocks:
‘Are you within, good Mistress Fox?
If you’re in want of a husband now,
Then will it please you to step below?

Mrs Fox asked: ‘Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has he a pointed
mouth?’ ‘No,’ answered the cat. ‘Then he won’t do for me.’

When the wolf was gone, came a dog, a stag, a hare, a bear, a lion, and
all the beasts of the forest, one after the other. But one of the good
qualities which old Mr Fox had possessed, was always lacking, and the
cat had continually to send the suitors away. At length came a young
fox. Then Mrs Fox said: ‘Has the gentleman red stockings on, and has a
little pointed mouth?’ ‘Yes,’ said the cat, ‘he has.’ ‘Then let him come
upstairs,’ said Mrs Fox, and ordered the servant to prepare the wedding
feast.

‘Sweep me the room as clean as you can,
Up with the window, fling out my old man!
For many a fine fat mouse he brought,
Yet of his wife he never thought,
But ate up every one he caught.’

Then the wedding was solemnized with young Mr Fox, and there was much
rejoicing and dancing; and if they have not left off, they are dancing
still.




THE SALAD

As a merry young huntsman was once going briskly along through a wood,
there came up a little old woman, and said to him, ‘Good day, good day;
you seem merry enough, but I am hungry and thirsty; do pray give me
something to eat.’ The huntsman took pity on her, and put his hand in
his pocket and gave her what he had. Then he wanted to go his way; but
she took hold of him, and said, ‘Listen, my friend, to what I am going
to tell you; I will reward you for your kindness; go your way, and after
a little time you will come to a tree where you will see nine birds
sitting on a cloak. Shoot into the midst of them, and one will fall down
dead: the cloak will fall too; take it, it is a wishing-cloak, and when
you wear it you will find yourself at any place where you may wish to
be. Cut open the dead bird, take out its heart and keep it, and you will
find a piece of gold under your pillow every morning when you rise. It
is the bird’s heart that will bring you this good luck.’

The huntsman thanked her, and thought to himself, ‘If all this does
happen, it will be a fine thing for me.’ When he had gone a hundred
steps or so, he heard a screaming and chirping in the branches over him,
and looked up and saw a flock of birds pulling a cloak with their bills
and feet; screaming, fighting, and tugging at each other as if
each wished to have it himself. ‘Well,’ said the huntsman, ‘this is
wonderful; this happens just as the old woman said’; then he shot into
the midst of them so that their feathers flew all about. Off went the
flock chattering away; but one fell down dead, and the cloak with it.
Then the huntsman did as the old woman told him, cut open the bird, took
out the heart, and carried the cloak home with him.

The next morning when he awoke he lifted up his pillow, and there lay
the piece of gold glittering underneath; the same happened next day, and
indeed every day when he arose. He heaped up a great deal of gold, and
at last thought to himself, ‘Of what use is this gold to me whilst I am
at home? I will go out into the world and look about me.’

Then he took leave of his friends, and hung his bag and bow about his
neck, and went his way. It so happened that his road one day led through
a thick wood, at the end of which was a large castle in a green meadow,
and at one of the windows stood an old woman with a very beautiful young
lady by her side looking about them. Now the old woman was a witch, and
said to the young lady, ‘There is a young man coming out of the wood who
carries a wonderful prize; we must get it away from him, my dear child,
for it is more fit for us than for him. He has a bird’s heart that
brings a piece of gold under his pillow every morning.’ Meantime the
huntsman came nearer and looked at the lady, and said to himself, ‘I
have been travelling so long that I should like to go into this castle
and rest myself, for I have money enough to pay for anything I want’;
but the real reason was, that he wanted to see more of the beautiful
lady. Then he went into the house, and was welcomed kindly; and it was
not long before he was so much in love that he thought of nothing else
but looking at the lady’s eyes, and doing everything that she wished.
Then the old woman said, ‘Now is the time for getting the bird’s heart.’
So the lady stole it away, and he never found any more gold under his
pillow, for it lay now under the young lady’s, and the old woman took it
away every morning; but he was so much in love that he never missed his
prize.

‘Well,’ said the old witch, ‘we have got the bird’s heart, but not the
wishing-cloak yet, and that we must also get.’ ‘Let us leave him that,’
said the young lady; ‘he has already lost his wealth.’ Then the witch
was very angry, and said, ‘Such a cloak is a very rare and wonderful
thing, and I must and will have it.’ So she did as the old woman told
her, and set herself at the window, and looked about the country and
seemed very sorrowful; then the huntsman said, ‘What makes you so sad?’
‘Alas! dear sir,’ said she, ‘yonder lies the granite rock where all the
costly diamonds grow, and I want so much to go there, that whenever I
think of it I cannot help being sorrowful, for who can reach it? only
the birds and the flies--man cannot.’ ‘If that’s all your grief,’ said
the huntsman, ‘I’ll take you there with all my heart’; so he drew her under
his cloak, and the moment he wished to be on the granite mountain they
were both there. The diamonds glittered so on all sides that they were
delighted with the sight and picked up the finest. But the old witch
made a deep sleep come upon him, and he said to the young lady, ‘Let us
sit down and rest ourselves a little, I am so tired that I cannot stand
any longer.’ So they sat down, and he laid his head in her lap and
fell asleep; and whilst he was sleeping on she took the cloak from
his shoulders, hung it on her own, picked up the diamonds, and wished
herself home again.

When he awoke and found that his lady had tricked him, and left him
alone on the wild rock, he said, ‘Alas! what roguery there is in the
world!’ and there he sat in great grief and fear, not knowing what to
do. Now this rock belonged to fierce giants who lived upon it; and as
he saw three of them striding about, he thought to himself, ‘I can only
save myself by feigning to be asleep’; so he laid himself down as if he
were in a sound sleep. When the giants came up to him, the first pushed
him with his foot, and said, ‘What worm is this that lies here curled
up?’ ‘Tread upon him and kill him,’ said the second. ‘It’s not worth the
trouble,’ said the third; ‘let him live, he’ll go climbing higher up the
mountain, and some cloud will come rolling and carry him away.’ And they
passed on. But the huntsman had heard all they said; and as soon as they
were gone, he climbed to the top of the mountain, and when he had sat
there a short time a cloud came rolling around him, and caught him in a
whirlwind and bore him along for some time, till it settled in a garden,
and he fell quite gently to the ground amongst the greens and cabbages.

Then he looked around him, and said, ‘I wish I had something to eat, if
not I shall be worse off than before; for here I see neither apples
nor pears, nor any kind of fruits, nothing but vegetables.’ At last he
thought to himself, ‘I can eat salad, it will refresh and strengthen
me.’ So he picked out a fine head and ate of it; but scarcely had he
swallowed two bites when he felt himself quite changed, and saw with
horror that he was turned into an ass. However, he still felt very
hungry, and the salad tasted very nice; so he ate on till he came
to another kind of salad, and scarcely had he tasted it when he felt
another change come over him, and soon saw that he was lucky enough to
have found his old shape again.

Then he laid himself down and slept off a little of his weariness; and
when he awoke the next morning he broke off a head both of the good and
the bad salad, and thought to himself, ‘This will help me to my fortune
again, and enable me to pay off some folks for their treachery.’ So he
went away to try and find the castle of his friends; and after wandering
about a few days he luckily found it. Then he stained his face all over
brown, so that even his mother would not have known him, and went into
the castle and asked for a lodging; ‘I am so tired,’ said he, ‘that I
can go no farther.’ ‘Countryman,’ said the witch, ‘who are you? and what
is your business?’ ‘I am,’ said he, ‘a messenger sent by the king to
find the finest salad that grows under the sun. I have been lucky
enough to find it, and have brought it with me; but the heat of the sun
scorches so that it begins to wither, and I don’t know that I can carry
it farther.’

When the witch and the young lady heard of his beautiful salad, they
longed to taste it, and said, ‘Dear countryman, let us just taste it.’
‘To be sure,’ answered he; ‘I have two heads of it with me, and will
give you one’; so he opened his bag and gave them the bad. Then the
witch herself took it into the kitchen to be dressed; and when it was
ready she could not wait till it was carried up, but took a few leaves
immediately and put them in her mouth, and scarcely were they swallowed
when she lost her own form and ran braying down into the court in the
form of an ass. Now the servant-maid came into the kitchen, and seeing
the salad ready, was going to carry it up; but on the way she too felt a
wish to taste it as the old woman had done, and ate some leaves; so she
also was turned into an ass and ran after the other, letting the dish
with the salad fall on the ground. The messenger sat all this time with
the beautiful young lady, and as nobody came with the salad and she
longed to taste it, she said, ‘I don’t know where the salad can be.’
Then he thought something must have happened, and said, ‘I will go
into the kitchen and see.’ And as he went he saw two asses in the court
running about, and the salad lying on the ground. ‘All right!’ said
he; ‘those two have had their share.’ Then he took up the rest of
the leaves, laid them on the dish and brought them to the young lady,
saying, ‘I bring you the dish myself that you may not wait any longer.’
So she ate of it, and like the others ran off into the court braying
away.

Then the huntsman washed his face and went into the court that they
might know him. ‘Now you shall be paid for your roguery,’ said he; and
tied them all three to a rope and took them along with him till he
came to a mill and knocked at the window. ‘What’s the matter?’ said the
miller. ‘I have three tiresome beasts here,’ said the other; ‘if you
will take them, give them food and room, and treat them as I tell you,
I will pay you whatever you ask.’ ‘With all my heart,’ said the miller;
‘but how shall I treat them?’ Then the huntsman said, ‘Give the old
one stripes three times a day and hay once; give the next (who was
the servant-maid) stripes once a day and hay three times; and give
the youngest (who was the beautiful lady) hay three times a day and
no stripes’: for he could not find it in his heart to have her beaten.
After this he went back to the castle, where he found everything he
wanted.

Some days after, the miller came to him and told him that the old ass
was dead; ‘The other two,’ said he, ‘are alive and eat, but are so
sorrowful that they cannot last long.’ Then the huntsman pitied them,
and told the miller to drive them back to him, and when they came, he
gave them some of the good salad to eat. And the beautiful young lady
fell upon her knees before him, and said, ‘O dearest huntsman! forgive
me all the ill I have done you; my mother forced me to it, it was
against my will, for I always loved you very much. Your wishing-cloak
hangs up in the closet, and as for the bird’s heart, I will give it you
too.’ But he said, ‘Keep it, it will be just the same thing, for I mean
to make you my wife.’ So they were married, and lived together very
happily till they died.




THE STORY OF THE YOUTH WHO WENT FORTH TO LEARN WHAT FEAR WAS

A certain father had two sons, the elder of who was smart and sensible,
and could do everything, but the younger was stupid and could neither
learn nor understand anything, and when people saw him they said:
‘There’s a fellow who will give his father some trouble!’ When anything
had to be done, it was always the elder who was forced to do it; but
if his father bade him fetch anything when it was late, or in the
night-time, and the way led through the churchyard, or any other dismal
place, he answered: ‘Oh, no father, I’ll not go there, it makes me
shudder!’ for he was afraid. Or when stories were told by the fire at
night which made the flesh creep, the listeners sometimes said: ‘Oh,
it makes us shudder!’ The younger sat in a corner and listened with
the rest of them, and could not imagine what they could mean. ‘They are
always saying: “It makes me shudder, it makes me shudder!” It does not
make me shudder,’ thought he. ‘That, too, must be an art of which I
understand nothing!’

Now it came to pass that his father said to him one day: ‘Hearken to me,
you fellow in the corner there, you are growing tall and strong, and you
too must learn something by which you can earn your bread. Look how your
brother works, but you do not even earn your salt.’ ‘Well, father,’ he
replied, ‘I am quite willing to learn something--indeed, if it could but
be managed, I should like to learn how to shudder. I don’t understand
that at all yet.’ The elder brother smiled when he heard that, and
thought to himself: ‘Goodness, what a blockhead that brother of mine is!
He will never be good for anything as long as he lives! He who wants to
be a sickle must bend himself betimes.’

The father sighed, and answered him: ‘You shall soon learn what it is to
shudder, but you will not earn your bread by that.’

Soon after this the sexton came to the house on a visit, and the father
bewailed his trouble, and told him how his younger son was so backward
in every respect that he knew nothing and learnt nothing. ‘Just think,’
said he, ‘when I asked him how he was going to earn his bread, he
actually wanted to learn to shudder.’ ‘If that be all,’ replied the
sexton, ‘he can learn that with me. Send him to me, and I will soon
polish him.’ The father was glad to do it, for he thought: ‘It will
train the boy a little.’ The sexton therefore took him into his house,
and he had to ring the church bell. After a day or two, the sexton awoke
him at midnight, and bade him arise and go up into the church tower and
ring the bell. ‘You shall soon learn what shuddering is,’ thought he,
and secretly went there before him; and when the boy was at the top of
the tower and turned round, and was just going to take hold of the bell
rope, he saw a white figure standing on the stairs opposite the sounding
hole. ‘Who is there?’ cried he, but the figure made no reply, and did
not move or stir. ‘Give an answer,’ cried the boy, ‘or take yourself
off, you have no business here at night.’

The sexton, however, remained standing motionless that the boy might
think he was a ghost. The boy cried a second time: ‘What do you want
here?--speak if you are an honest fellow, or I will throw you down the
steps!’ The sexton thought: ‘He can’t mean to be as bad as his words,’
uttered no sound and stood as if he were made of stone. Then the boy
called to him for the third time, and as that was also to no purpose,
he ran against him and pushed the ghost down the stairs, so that it fell
down the ten steps and remained lying there in a corner. Thereupon he
rang the bell, went home, and without saying a word went to bed, and
fell asleep. The sexton’s wife waited a long time for her husband, but
he did not come back. At length she became uneasy, and wakened the boy,
and asked: ‘Do you know where my husband is? He climbed up the tower
before you did.’ ‘No, I don’t know,’ replied the boy, ‘but someone was
standing by the sounding hole on the other side of the steps, and as he
would neither gave an answer nor go away, I took him for a scoundrel,
and threw him downstairs. Just go there and you will see if it was he.
I should be sorry if it were.’ The woman ran away and found her husband,
who was lying moaning in the corner, and had broken his leg.

She carried him down, and then with loud screams she hastened to the
boy’s father, ‘Your boy,’ cried she, ‘has been the cause of a great
misfortune! He has thrown my husband down the steps so that he broke his
leg. Take the good-for-nothing fellow out of our house.’ The father was
terrified, and ran thither and scolded the boy. ‘What wicked tricks
are these?’ said he. ‘The devil must have put them into your head.’
‘Father,’ he replied, ‘do listen to me. I am quite innocent. He was
standing there by night like one intent on doing evil. I did not know
who it was, and I entreated him three times either to speak or to go
away.’ ‘Ah,’ said the father, ‘I have nothing but unhappiness with you.
Go out of my sight. I will see you no more.’

‘Yes, father, right willingly, wait only until it is day. Then will I
go forth and learn how to shudder, and then I shall, at any rate,
understand one art which will support me.’ ‘Learn what you will,’ spoke
the father, ‘it is all the same to me. Here are fifty talers for you.
Take these and go into the wide world, and tell no one from whence you
come, and who is your father, for I have reason to be ashamed of you.’
‘Yes, father, it shall be as you will. If you desire nothing more than
that, I can easily keep it in mind.’

When the day dawned, therefore, the boy put his fifty talers into his
pocket, and went forth on the great highway, and continually said to
himself: ‘If I could but shudder! If I could but shudder!’ Then a man
approached who heard this conversation which the youth was holding with
himself, and when they had walked a little farther to where they could
see the gallows, the man said to him: ‘Look, there is the tree where
seven men have married the ropemaker’s daughter, and are now learning
how to fly. Sit down beneath it, and wait till night comes, and you will
soon learn how to shudder.’ ‘If that is all that is wanted,’ answered
the youth, ‘it is easily done; but if I learn how to shudder as fast as
that, you shall have my fifty talers. Just come back to me early in the
morning.’ Then the youth went to the gallows, sat down beneath it, and
waited till evening came. And as he was cold, he lighted himself a fire,
but at midnight the wind blew so sharply that in spite of his fire, he
could not get warm. And as the wind knocked the hanged men against each
other, and they moved backwards and forwards, he thought to himself:
‘If you shiver below by the fire, how those up above must freeze and
suffer!’ And as he felt pity for them, he raised the ladder, and climbed
up, unbound one of them after the other, and brought down all seven.
Then he stoked the fire, blew it, and set them all round it to warm
themselves. But they sat there and did not stir, and the fire caught
their clothes. So he said: ‘Take care, or I will hang you up again.’ The
dead men, however, did not hear, but were quite silent, and let their
rags go on burning. At this he grew angry, and said: ‘If you will not
take care, I cannot help you, I will not be burnt with you,’ and he hung
them up again each in his turn. Then he sat down by his fire and fell
asleep, and the next morning the man came to him and wanted to have
the fifty talers, and said: ‘Well do you know how to shudder?’ ‘No,’
answered he, ‘how should I know? Those fellows up there did not open
their mouths, and were so stupid that they let the few old rags which
they had on their bodies get burnt.’ Then the man saw that he would not
get the fifty talers that day, and went away saying: ‘Such a youth has
never come my way before.’

The youth likewise went his way, and once more began to mutter to
himself: ‘Ah, if I could but shudder! Ah, if I could but shudder!’ A
waggoner who was striding behind him heard this and asked: ‘Who are
you?’ ‘I don’t know,’ answered the youth. Then the waggoner asked: ‘From
whence do you come?’ ‘I know not.’ ‘Who is your father?’ ‘That I may
not tell you.’ ‘What is it that you are always muttering between your
teeth?’ ‘Ah,’ replied the youth, ‘I do so wish I could shudder, but
no one can teach me how.’ ‘Enough of your foolish chatter,’ said the
waggoner. ‘Come, go with me, I will see about a place for you.’ The
youth went with the waggoner, and in the evening they arrived at an inn
where they wished to pass the night. Then at the entrance of the parlour
the youth again said quite loudly: ‘If I could but shudder! If I could
but shudder!’ The host who heard this, laughed and said: ‘If that is
your desire, there ought to be a good opportunity for you here.’ ‘Ah,
be silent,’ said the hostess, ‘so many prying persons have already lost
their lives, it would be a pity and a shame if such beautiful eyes as
these should never see the daylight again.’

But the youth said: ‘However difficult it may be, I will learn it. For
this purpose indeed have I journeyed forth.’ He let the host have
no rest, until the latter told him, that not far from thence stood a
haunted castle where anyone could very easily learn what shuddering was,
if he would but watch in it for three nights. The king had promised that
he who would venture should have his daughter to wife, and she was the
most beautiful maiden the sun shone on. Likewise in the castle lay great
treasures, which were guarded by evil spirits, and these treasures would
then be freed, and would make a poor man rich enough. Already many men
had gone into the castle, but as yet none had come out again. Then the
youth went next morning to the king, and said: ‘If it be allowed, I will
willingly watch three nights in the haunted castle.’

The king looked at him, and as the youth pleased him, he said: ‘You may
ask for three things to take into the castle with you, but they must
be things without life.’ Then he answered: ‘Then I ask for a fire, a
turning lathe, and a cutting-board with the knife.’

The king had these things carried into the castle for him during the
day. When night was drawing near, the youth went up and made himself
a bright fire in one of the rooms, placed the cutting-board and knife
beside it, and seated himself by the turning-lathe. ‘Ah, if I could
but shudder!’ said he, ‘but I shall not learn it here either.’ Towards
midnight he was about to poke his fire, and as he was blowing it,
something cried suddenly from one corner: ‘Au, miau! how cold we are!’
‘You fools!’ cried he, ‘what are you crying about? If you are cold, come
and take a seat by the fire and warm yourselves.’ And when he had said
that, two great black cats came with one tremendous leap and sat down
on each side of him, and looked savagely at him with their fiery
eyes. After a short time, when they had warmed themselves, they said:
‘Comrade, shall we have a game of cards?’ ‘Why not?’ he replied, ‘but
just show me your paws.’ Then they stretched out their claws. ‘Oh,’ said
he, ‘what long nails you have! Wait, I must first cut them for you.’
Thereupon he seized them by the throats, put them on the cutting-board
and screwed their feet fast. ‘I have looked at your fingers,’ said he,
‘and my fancy for card-playing has gone,’ and he struck them dead and
threw them out into the water. But when he had made away with these two,
and was about to sit down again by his fire, out from every hole and
corner came black cats and black dogs with red-hot chains, and more
and more of them came until he could no longer move, and they yelled
horribly, and got on his fire, pulled it to pieces, and tried to put
it out. He watched them for a while quietly, but at last when they were
going too far, he seized his cutting-knife, and cried: ‘Away with you,
vermin,’ and began to cut them down. Some of them ran away, the others
he killed, and threw out into the fish-pond. When he came back he fanned
the embers of his fire again and warmed himself. And as he thus sat, his
eyes would keep open no longer, and he felt a desire to sleep. Then he
looked round and saw a great bed in the corner. ‘That is the very thing
for me,’ said he, and got into it. When he was just going to shut his
eyes, however, the bed began to move of its own accord, and went over
the whole of the castle. ‘That’s right,’ said he, ‘but go faster.’ Then
the bed rolled on as if six horses were harnessed to it, up and down,
over thresholds and stairs, but suddenly hop, hop, it turned over upside
down, and lay on him like a mountain. But he threw quilts and pillows up
in the air, got out and said: ‘Now anyone who likes, may drive,’ and
lay down by his fire, and slept till it was day. In the morning the king
came, and when he saw him lying there on the ground, he thought the evil
spirits had killed him and he was dead. Then said he: ‘After all it is a
pity,--for so handsome a man.’ The youth heard it, got up, and said: ‘It
has not come to that yet.’ Then the king was astonished, but very glad,
and asked how he had fared. ‘Very well indeed,’ answered he; ‘one
night is past, the two others will pass likewise.’ Then he went to the
innkeeper, who opened his eyes very wide, and said: ‘I never expected to
see you alive again! Have you learnt how to shudder yet?’ ‘No,’ said he,
‘it is all in vain. If someone would but tell me!’

The second night he again went up into the old castle, sat down by the
fire, and once more began his old song: ‘If I could but shudder!’ When
midnight came, an uproar and noise of tumbling about was heard; at
first it was low, but it grew louder and louder. Then it was quiet for
a while, and at length with a loud scream, half a man came down the
chimney and fell before him. ‘Hullo!’ cried he, ‘another half belongs
to this. This is not enough!’ Then the uproar began again, there was a
roaring and howling, and the other half fell down likewise. ‘Wait,’ said
he, ‘I will just stoke up the fire a little for you.’ When he had done
that and looked round again, the two pieces were joined together, and a
hideous man was sitting in his place. ‘That is no part of our bargain,’
said the youth, ‘the bench is mine.’ The man wanted to push him away;
the youth, however, would not allow that, but thrust him off with all
his strength, and seated himself again in his own place. Then still more
men fell down, one after the other; they brought nine dead men’s legs
and two skulls, and set them up and played at nine-pins with them. The
youth also wanted to play and said: ‘Listen you, can I join you?’ ‘Yes,
if you have any money.’ ‘Money enough,’ replied he, ‘but your balls are
not quite round.’ Then he took the skulls and put them in the lathe and
turned them till they were round. ‘There, now they will roll better!’
said he. ‘Hurrah! now we’ll have fun!’ He played with them and lost some
of his money, but when it struck twelve, everything vanished from his
sight. He lay down and quietly fell asleep. Next morning the king came
to inquire after him. ‘How has it fared with you this time?’ asked he.
‘I have been playing at nine-pins,’ he answered, ‘and have lost a couple
of farthings.’ ‘Have you not shuddered then?’ ‘What?’ said he, ‘I have
had a wonderful time! If I did but know what it was to shudder!’

The third night he sat down again on his bench and said quite sadly:
‘If I could but shudder.’ When it grew late, six tall men came in and
brought a coffin. Then he said: ‘Ha, ha, that is certainly my little
cousin, who died only a few days ago,’ and he beckoned with his finger,
and cried: ‘Come, little cousin, come.’ They placed the coffin on the
ground, but he went to it and took the lid off, and a dead man lay
therein. He felt his face, but it was cold as ice. ‘Wait,’ said he, ‘I
will warm you a little,’ and went to the fire and warmed his hand and
laid it on the dead man’s face, but he remained cold. Then he took him
out, and sat down by the fire and laid him on his breast and rubbed his
arms that the blood might circulate again. As this also did no good, he
thought to himself: ‘When two people lie in bed together, they warm each
other,’ and carried him to the bed, covered him over and lay down by
him. After a short time the dead man became warm too, and began to move.
Then said the youth, ‘See, little cousin, have I not warmed you?’ The
dead man, however, got up and cried: ‘Now will I strangle you.’

‘What!’ said he, ‘is that the way you thank me? You shall at once go
into your coffin again,’ and he took him up, threw him into it, and shut
the lid. Then came the six men and carried him away again. ‘I cannot
manage to shudder,’ said he. ‘I shall never learn it here as long as I
live.’

Then a man entered who was taller than all others, and looked terrible.
He was old, however, and had a long white beard. ‘You wretch,’ cried he,
‘you shall soon learn what it is to shudder, for you shall die.’ ‘Not so
fast,’ replied the youth. ‘If I am to die, I shall have to have a say
in it.’ ‘I will soon seize you,’ said the fiend. ‘Softly, softly, do not
talk so big. I am as strong as you are, and perhaps even stronger.’
‘We shall see,’ said the old man. ‘If you are stronger, I will let you
go--come, we will try.’ Then he led him by dark passages to a smith’s
forge, took an axe, and with one blow struck an anvil into the ground.
‘I can do better than that,’ said the youth, and went to the other
anvil. The old man placed himself near and wanted to look on, and his
white beard hung down. Then the youth seized the axe, split the anvil
with one blow, and in it caught the old man’s beard. ‘Now I have you,’
said the youth. ‘Now it is your turn to die.’ Then he seized an iron bar
and beat the old man till he moaned and entreated him to stop, when he
would give him great riches. The youth drew out the axe and let him go.
The old man led him back into the castle, and in a cellar showed him
three chests full of gold. ‘Of these,’ said he, ‘one part is for the
poor, the other for the king, the third yours.’ In the meantime it
struck twelve, and the spirit disappeared, so that the youth stood in
darkness. ‘I shall still be able to find my way out,’ said he, and felt
about, found the way into the room, and slept there by his fire.
Next morning the king came and said: ‘Now you must have learnt what
shuddering is?’ ‘No,’ he answered; ‘what can it be? My dead cousin was
here, and a bearded man came and showed me a great deal of money down
below, but no one told me what it was to shudder.’ ‘Then,’ said the
king, ‘you have saved the castle, and shall marry my daughter.’ ‘That
is all very well,’ said he, ‘but still I do not know what it is to
shudder!’

Then the gold was brought up and the wedding celebrated; but howsoever
much the young king loved his wife, and however happy he was, he still
said always: ‘If I could but shudder--if I could but shudder.’ And this
at last angered her. Her waiting-maid said: ‘I will find a cure for him;
he shall soon learn what it is to shudder.’ She went out to the stream
which flowed through the garden, and had a whole bucketful of gudgeons
brought to her. At night when the young king was sleeping, his wife was
to draw the clothes off him and empty the bucket full of cold water
with the gudgeons in it over him, so that the little fishes would
sprawl about him. Then he woke up and cried: ‘Oh, what makes me shudder
so?--what makes me shudder so, dear wife? Ah! now I know what it is to
shudder!’




KING GRISLY-BEARD

A great king of a land far away in the East had a daughter who was very
beautiful, but so proud, and haughty, and conceited, that none of the
princes who came to ask her in marriage was good enough for her, and she
only made sport of them.

Once upon a time the king held a great feast, and asked thither all
her suitors; and they all sat in a row, ranged according to their
rank--kings, and princes, and dukes, and earls, and counts, and barons,
and knights. Then the princess came in, and as she passed by them she
had something spiteful to say to every one. The first was too fat: ‘He’s
as round as a tub,’ said she. The next was too tall: ‘What a maypole!’
said she. The next was too short: ‘What a dumpling!’ said she. The
fourth was too pale, and she called him ‘Wallface.’ The fifth was too
red, so she called him ‘Coxcomb.’ The sixth was not straight enough;
so she said he was like a green stick, that had been laid to dry over
a baker’s oven. And thus she had some joke to crack upon every one: but
she laughed more than all at a good king who was there. ‘Look at
him,’ said she; ‘his beard is like an old mop; he shall be called
Grisly-beard.’ So the king got the nickname of Grisly-beard.

But the old king was very angry when he saw how his daughter behaved,
and how she ill-treated all his guests; and he vowed that, willing or
unwilling, she should marry the first man, be he prince or beggar, that
came to the door.

Two days after there came by a travelling fiddler, who began to play
under the window and beg alms; and when the king heard him, he said,
‘Let him come in.’ So they brought in a dirty-looking fellow; and when
he had sung before the king and the princess, he begged a boon. Then the
king said, ‘You have sung so well, that I will give you my daughter for
your wife.’ The princess begged and prayed; but the king said, ‘I have
sworn to give you to the first comer, and I will keep my word.’ So words
and tears were of no avail; the parson was sent for, and she was married
to the fiddler. When this was over the king said, ‘Now get ready to
go--you must not stay here--you must travel on with your husband.’

Then the fiddler went his way, and took her with him, and they soon came
to a great wood. ‘Pray,’ said she, ‘whose is this wood?’ ‘It belongs
to King Grisly-beard,’ answered he; ‘hadst thou taken him, all had been
thine.’ ‘Ah! unlucky wretch that I am!’ sighed she; ‘would that I had
married King Grisly-beard!’ Next they came to some fine meadows. ‘Whose
are these beautiful green meadows?’ said she. ‘They belong to King
Grisly-beard, hadst thou taken him, they had all been thine.’ ‘Ah!
unlucky wretch that I am!’ said she; ‘would that I had married King
Grisly-beard!’

Then they came to a great city. ‘Whose is this noble city?’ said she.
‘It belongs to King Grisly-beard; hadst thou taken him, it had all been
thine.’ ‘Ah! wretch that I am!’ sighed she; ‘why did I not marry King
Grisly-beard?’ ‘That is no business of mine,’ said the fiddler: ‘why
should you wish for another husband? Am not I good enough for you?’

At last they came to a small cottage. ‘What a paltry place!’ said she;
‘to whom does that little dirty hole belong?’ Then the fiddler said,
‘That is your and my house, where we are to live.’ ‘Where are your
servants?’ cried she. ‘What do we want with servants?’ said he; ‘you
must do for yourself whatever is to be done. Now make the fire, and put
on water and cook my supper, for I am very tired.’ But the princess knew
nothing of making fires and cooking, and the fiddler was forced to help
her. When they had eaten a very scanty meal they went to bed; but the
fiddler called her up very early in the morning to clean the house. Thus
they lived for two days: and when they had eaten up all there was in the
cottage, the man said, ‘Wife, we can’t go on thus, spending money and
earning nothing. You must learn to weave baskets.’ Then he went out and
cut willows, and brought them home, and she began to weave; but it made
her fingers very sore. ‘I see this work won’t do,’ said he: ‘try and
spin; perhaps you will do that better.’ So she sat down and tried to
spin; but the threads cut her tender fingers till the blood ran. ‘See
now,’ said the fiddler, ‘you are good for nothing; you can do no work:
what a bargain I have got! However, I’ll try and set up a trade in pots
and pans, and you shall stand in the market and sell them.’ ‘Alas!’
sighed she, ‘if any of my father’s court should pass by and see me
standing in the market, how they will laugh at me!’

But her husband did not care for that, and said she must work, if she
did not wish to die of hunger. At first the trade went well; for many
people, seeing such a beautiful woman, went to buy her wares, and paid
their money without thinking of taking away the goods. They lived on
this as long as it lasted; and then her husband bought a fresh lot of
ware, and she sat herself down with it in the corner of the market; but
a drunken soldier soon came by, and rode his horse against her stall,
and broke all her goods into a thousand pieces. Then she began to cry,
and knew not what to do. ‘Ah! what will become of me?’ said she; ‘what
will my husband say?’ So she ran home and told him all. ‘Who would
have thought you would have been so silly,’ said he, ‘as to put an
earthenware stall in the corner of the market, where everybody passes?
but let us have no more crying; I see you are not fit for this sort of
work, so I have been to the king’s palace, and asked if they did not
want a kitchen-maid; and they say they will take you, and there you will
have plenty to eat.’

Thus the princess became a kitchen-maid, and helped the cook to do all
the dirtiest work; but she was allowed to carry home some of the meat
that was left, and on this they lived.

She had not been there long before she heard that the king’s eldest son
was passing by, going to be married; and she went to one of the windows
and looked out. Everything was ready, and all the pomp and brightness of
the court was there. Then she bitterly grieved for the pride and folly
which had brought her so low. And the servants gave her some of the rich
meats, which she put into her basket to take home.

All on a sudden, as she was going out, in came the king’s son in golden
clothes; and when he saw a beautiful woman at the door, he took her
by the hand, and said she should be his partner in the dance; but she
trembled for fear, for she saw that it was King Grisly-beard, who was
making sport of her. However, he kept fast hold, and led her in; and the
cover of the basket came off, so that the meats in it fell about. Then
everybody laughed and jeered at her; and she was so abashed, that she
wished herself a thousand feet deep in the earth. She sprang to the
door to run away; but on the steps King Grisly-beard overtook her, and
brought her back and said, ‘Fear me not! I am the fiddler who has lived
with you in the hut. I brought you there because I really loved you. I
am also the soldier that overset your stall. I have done all this only
to cure you of your silly pride, and to show you the folly of your
ill-treatment of me. Now all is over: you have learnt wisdom, and it is
time to hold our marriage feast.’

Then the chamberlains came and brought her the most beautiful robes; and
her father and his whole court were there already, and welcomed her home
on her marriage. Joy was in every face and every heart. The feast was
grand; they danced and sang; all were merry; and I only wish that you
and I had been of the party.




IRON HANS

There was once upon a time a king who had a great forest near his
palace, full of all kinds of wild animals. One day he sent out a
huntsman to shoot him a roe, but he did not come back. ‘Perhaps some
accident has befallen him,’ said the king, and the next day he sent out
two more huntsmen who were to search for him, but they too stayed away.
Then on the third day, he sent for all his huntsmen, and said: ‘Scour
the whole forest through, and do not give up until you have found all
three.’ But of these also, none came home again, none were seen again.
From that time forth, no one would any longer venture into the forest,
and it lay there in deep stillness and solitude, and nothing was seen
of it, but sometimes an eagle or a hawk flying over it. This lasted for
many years, when an unknown huntsman announced himself to the king as
seeking a situation, and offered to go into the dangerous forest. The
king, however, would not give his consent, and said: ‘It is not safe in
there; I fear it would fare with you no better than with the others,
and you would never come out again.’ The huntsman replied: ‘Lord, I will
venture it at my own risk, of fear I know nothing.’

The huntsman therefore betook himself with his dog to the forest. It was
not long before the dog fell in with some game on the way, and wanted to
pursue it; but hardly had the dog run two steps when it stood before a
deep pool, could go no farther, and a naked arm stretched itself out of
the water, seized it, and drew it under. When the huntsman saw that, he
went back and fetched three men to come with buckets and bale out the
water. When they could see to the bottom there lay a wild man whose body
was brown like rusty iron, and whose hair hung over his face down to his
knees. They bound him with cords, and led him away to the castle. There
was great astonishment over the wild man; the king, however, had him put
in an iron cage in his courtyard, and forbade the door to be opened
on pain of death, and the queen herself was to take the key into her
keeping. And from this time forth everyone could again go into the
forest with safety.

The king had a son of eight years, who was once playing in the
courtyard, and while he was playing, his golden ball fell into the cage.
The boy ran thither and said: ‘Give me my ball out.’ ‘Not till you have
opened the door for me,’ answered the man. ‘No,’ said the boy, ‘I will
not do that; the king has forbidden it,’ and ran away. The next day he
again went and asked for his ball; the wild man said: ‘Open my door,’
but the boy would not. On the third day the king had ridden out hunting,
and the boy went once more and said: ‘I cannot open the door even if I
wished, for I have not the key.’ Then the wild man said: ‘It lies under
your mother’s pillow, you can get it there.’ The boy, who wanted to have
his ball back, cast all thought to the winds, and brought the key. The
door opened with difficulty, and the boy pinched his fingers. When it
was open the wild man stepped out, gave him the golden ball, and hurried
away. The boy had become afraid; he called and cried after him: ‘Oh,
wild man, do not go away, or I shall be beaten!’ The wild man turned
back, took him up, set him on his shoulder, and went with hasty steps
into the forest. When the king came home, he observed the empty cage,
and asked the queen how that had happened. She knew nothing about it,
and sought the key, but it was gone. She called the boy, but no one
answered. The king sent out people to seek for him in the fields, but
they did not find him. Then he could easily guess what had happened, and
much grief reigned in the royal court.

When the wild man had once more reached the dark forest, he took the boy
down from his shoulder, and said to him: ‘You will never see your father
and mother again, but I will keep you with me, for you have set me free,
and I have compassion on you. If you do all I bid you, you shall fare
well. Of treasure and gold have I enough, and more than anyone in the
world.’ He made a bed of moss for the boy on which he slept, and the
next morning the man took him to a well, and said: ‘Behold, the gold
well is as bright and clear as crystal, you shall sit beside it, and
take care that nothing falls into it, or it will be polluted. I will
come every evening to see if you have obeyed my order.’ The boy placed
himself by the brink of the well, and often saw a golden fish or a
golden snake show itself therein, and took care that nothing fell in.
As he was thus sitting, his finger hurt him so violently that he
involuntarily put it in the water. He drew it quickly out again, but saw
that it was quite gilded, and whatsoever pains he took to wash the gold
off again, all was to no purpose. In the evening Iron Hans came back,
looked at the boy, and said: ‘What has happened to the well?’ ‘Nothing
nothing,’ he answered, and held his finger behind his back, that the
man might not see it. But he said: ‘You have dipped your finger into
the water, this time it may pass, but take care you do not again let
anything go in.’ By daybreak the boy was already sitting by the well and
watching it. His finger hurt him again and he passed it over his head,
and then unhappily a hair fell down into the well. He took it quickly
out, but it was already quite gilded. Iron Hans came, and already knew
what had happened. ‘You have let a hair fall into the well,’ said he.
‘I will allow you to watch by it once more, but if this happens for the
third time then the well is polluted and you can no longer remain with
me.’

On the third day, the boy sat by the well, and did not stir his finger,
however much it hurt him. But the time was long to him, and he looked at
the reflection of his face on the surface of the water. And as he
still bent down more and more while he was doing so, and trying to look
straight into the eyes, his long hair fell down from his shoulders into
the water. He raised himself up quickly, but the whole of the hair of
his head was already golden and shone like the sun. You can imagine how
terrified the poor boy was! He took his pocket-handkerchief and tied it
round his head, in order that the man might not see it. When he came he
already knew everything, and said: ‘Take the handkerchief off.’ Then the
golden hair streamed forth, and let the boy excuse himself as he might,
it was of no use. ‘You have not stood the trial and can stay here no
longer. Go forth into the world, there you will learn what poverty is.
But as you have not a bad heart, and as I mean well by you, there is
one thing I will grant you; if you fall into any difficulty, come to the
forest and cry: “Iron Hans,” and then I will come and help you. My
power is great, greater than you think, and I have gold and silver in
abundance.’

Then the king’s son left the forest, and walked by beaten and unbeaten
paths ever onwards until at length he reached a great city. There he
looked for work, but could find none, and he learnt nothing by which he
could help himself. At length he went to the palace, and asked if they
would take him in. The people about court did not at all know what use
they could make of him, but they liked him, and told him to stay. At
length the cook took him into his service, and said he might carry wood
and water, and rake the cinders together. Once when it so happened that
no one else was at hand, the cook ordered him to carry the food to the
royal table, but as he did not like to let his golden hair be seen, he
kept his little cap on. Such a thing as that had never yet come under
the king’s notice, and he said: ‘When you come to the royal table you
must take your hat off.’ He answered: ‘Ah, Lord, I cannot; I have a bad
sore place on my head.’ Then the king had the cook called before him
and scolded him, and asked how he could take such a boy as that into his
service; and that he was to send him away at once. The cook, however,
had pity on him, and exchanged him for the gardener’s boy.

And now the boy had to plant and water the garden, hoe and dig, and bear
the wind and bad weather. Once in summer when he was working alone in
the garden, the day was so warm he took his little cap off that the air
might cool him. As the sun shone on his hair it glittered and flashed so
that the rays fell into the bedroom of the king’s daughter, and up she
sprang to see what that could be. Then she saw the boy, and cried to
him: ‘Boy, bring me a wreath of flowers.’ He put his cap on with all
haste, and gathered wild field-flowers and bound them together. When he
was ascending the stairs with them, the gardener met him, and said: ‘How
can you take the king’s daughter a garland of such common flowers? Go
quickly, and get another, and seek out the prettiest and rarest.’ ‘Oh,
no,’ replied the boy, ‘the wild ones have more scent, and will please
her better.’ When he got into the room, the king’s daughter said: ‘Take
your cap off, it is not seemly to keep it on in my presence.’ He again
said: ‘I may not, I have a sore head.’ She, however, caught at his
cap and pulled it off, and then his golden hair rolled down on his
shoulders, and it was splendid to behold. He wanted to run out, but she
held him by the arm, and gave him a handful of ducats. With these he
departed, but he cared nothing for the gold pieces. He took them to the
gardener, and said: ‘I present them to your children, they can play with
them.’ The following day the king’s daughter again called to him that he
was to bring her a wreath of field-flowers, and then he went in with it,
she instantly snatched at his cap, and wanted to take it away from him,
but he held it fast with both hands. She again gave him a handful of
ducats, but he would not keep them, and gave them to the gardener for
playthings for his children. On the third day things went just the
same; she could not get his cap away from him, and he would not have her
money.

Not long afterwards, the country was overrun by war. The king gathered
together his people, and did not know whether or not he could offer any
opposition to the enemy, who was superior in strength and had a mighty
army. Then said the gardener’s boy: ‘I am grown up, and will go to the
wars also, only give me a horse.’ The others laughed, and said: ‘Seek
one for yourself when we are gone, we will leave one behind us in the
stable for you.’ When they had gone forth, he went into the stable, and
led the horse out; it was lame of one foot, and limped hobblety jib,
hobblety jib; nevertheless he mounted it, and rode away to the dark
forest. When he came to the outskirts, he called ‘Iron Hans’ three
times so loudly that it echoed through the trees. Thereupon the wild man
appeared immediately, and said: ‘What do you desire?’ ‘I want a strong
steed, for I am going to the wars.’ ‘That you shall have, and still more
than you ask for.’ Then the wild man went back into the forest, and it
was not long before a stable-boy came out of it, who led a horse that
snorted with its nostrils, and could hardly be restrained, and behind
them followed a great troop of warriors entirely equipped in iron, and
their swords flashed in the sun. The youth made over his three-legged
horse to the stable-boy, mounted the other, and rode at the head of the
soldiers. When he got near the battlefield a great part of the king’s
men had already fallen, and little was wanting to make the rest give
way. Then the youth galloped thither with his iron soldiers, broke like
a hurricane over the enemy, and beat down all who opposed him. They
began to flee, but the youth pursued, and never stopped, until there
was not a single man left. Instead of returning to the king, however, he
conducted his troop by byways back to the forest, and called forth Iron
Hans. ‘What do you desire?’ asked the wild man. ‘Take back your horse
and your troops, and give me my three-legged horse again.’ All that he
asked was done, and soon he was riding on his three-legged horse. When
the king returned to his palace, his daughter went to meet him, and
wished him joy of his victory. ‘I am not the one who carried away the
victory,’ said he, ‘but a strange knight who came to my assistance with
his soldiers.’ The daughter wanted to hear who the strange knight was,
but the king did not know, and said: ‘He followed the enemy, and I did
not see him again.’ She inquired of the gardener where his boy was, but
he smiled, and said: ‘He has just come home on his three-legged horse,
and the others have been mocking him, and crying: “Here comes our
hobblety jib back again!” They asked, too: “Under what hedge have you
been lying sleeping all the time?” So he said: “I did the best of all,
and it would have gone badly without me.” And then he was still more
ridiculed.’

The king said to his daughter: ‘I will proclaim a great feast that shall
last for three days, and you shall throw a golden apple. Perhaps the
unknown man will show himself.’ When the feast was announced, the youth
went out to the forest, and called Iron Hans. ‘What do you desire?’
asked he. ‘That I may catch the king’s daughter’s golden apple.’ ‘It is
as safe as if you had it already,’ said Iron Hans. ‘You shall likewise
have a suit of red armour for the occasion, and ride on a spirited
chestnut-horse.’ When the day came, the youth galloped to the spot, took
his place amongst the knights, and was recognized by no one. The king’s
daughter came forward, and threw a golden apple to the knights, but none
of them caught it but he, only as soon as he had it he galloped away.

On the second day Iron Hans equipped him as a white knight, and gave him
a white horse. Again he was the only one who caught the apple, and
he did not linger an instant, but galloped off with it. The king grew
angry, and said: ‘That is not allowed; he must appear before me and tell
his name.’ He gave the order that if the knight who caught the apple,
should go away again they should pursue him, and if he would not come
back willingly, they were to cut him down and stab him.

On the third day, he received from Iron Hans a suit of black armour and
a black horse, and again he caught the apple. But when he was riding off
with it, the king’s attendants pursued him, and one of them got so near
him that he wounded the youth’s leg with the point of his sword. The
youth nevertheless escaped from them, but his horse leapt so violently
that the helmet fell from the youth’s head, and they could see that he
had golden hair. They rode back and announced this to the king.

The following day the king’s daughter asked the gardener about his
boy. ‘He is at work in the garden; the queer creature has been at the
festival too, and only came home yesterday evening; he has likewise
shown my children three golden apples which he has won.’

The king had him summoned into his presence, and he came and again had
his little cap on his head. But the king’s daughter went up to him and
took it off, and then his golden hair fell down over his shoulders, and
he was so handsome that all were amazed. ‘Are you the knight who came
every day to the festival, always in different colours, and who caught
the three golden apples?’ asked the king. ‘Yes,’ answered he, ‘and here
the apples are,’ and he took them out of his pocket, and returned them
to the king. ‘If you desire further proof, you may see the wound which
your people gave me when they followed me. But I am likewise the knight
who helped you to your victory over your enemies.’ ‘If you can perform
such deeds as that, you are no gardener’s boy; tell me, who is your
father?’ ‘My father is a mighty king, and gold have I in plenty as great
as I require.’ ‘I well see,’ said the king, ‘that I owe my thanks to
you; can I do anything to please you?’ ‘Yes,’ answered he, ‘that indeed
you can. Give me your daughter to wife.’ The maiden laughed, and said:
‘He does not stand much on ceremony, but I have already seen by his
golden hair that he was no gardener’s boy,’ and then she went and
kissed him. His father and mother came to the wedding, and were in great
delight, for they had given up all hope of ever seeing their dear
son again. And as they were sitting at the marriage-feast, the music
suddenly stopped, the doors opened, and a stately king came in with a
great retinue. He went up to the youth, embraced him and said: ‘I am
Iron Hans, and was by enchantment a wild man, but you have set me free;
all the treasures which I possess, shall be your property.’




CAT-SKIN

There was once a king, whose queen had hair of the purest gold, and was
so beautiful that her match was not to be met with on the whole face of
the earth. But this beautiful queen fell ill, and when she felt that her
end drew near she called the king to her and said, ‘Promise me that you
will never marry again, unless you meet with a wife who is as beautiful
as I am, and who has golden hair like mine.’ Then when the king in his
grief promised all she asked, she shut her eyes and died. But the king
was not to be comforted, and for a long time never thought of taking
another wife. At last, however, his wise men said, ‘this will not do;
the king must marry again, that we may have a queen.’ So messengers were
sent far and wide, to seek for a bride as beautiful as the late queen.
But there was no princess in the world so beautiful; and if there had
been, still there was not one to be found who had golden hair. So the
messengers came home, and had had all their trouble for nothing.

Now the king had a daughter, who was just as beautiful as her mother,
and had the same golden hair. And when she was grown up, the king looked
at her and saw that she was just like this late queen: then he said to
his courtiers, ‘May I not marry my daughter? She is the very image of my
dead wife: unless I have her, I shall not find any bride upon the whole
earth, and you say there must be a queen.’ When the courtiers heard this
they were shocked, and said, ‘Heaven forbid that a father should marry
his daughter! Out of so great a sin no good can come.’ And his daughter
was also shocked, but hoped the king would soon give up such thoughts;
so she said to him, ‘Before I marry anyone I must have three dresses:
one must be of gold, like the sun; another must be of shining silver,
like the moon; and a third must be dazzling as the stars: besides this,
I want a mantle of a thousand different kinds of fur put together, to
which every beast in the kingdom must give a part of his skin.’ And thus
she thought he would think of the matter no more. But the king made the
most skilful workmen in his kingdom weave the three dresses: one golden,
like the sun; another silvery, like the moon; and a third sparkling,
like the stars: and his hunters were told to hunt out all the beasts in
his kingdom, and to take the finest fur out of their skins: and thus a
mantle of a thousand furs was made.

When all were ready, the king sent them to her; but she got up in the
night when all were asleep, and took three of her trinkets, a golden
ring, a golden necklace, and a golden brooch, and packed the three
dresses--of the sun, the moon, and the stars--up in a nutshell, and
wrapped herself up in the mantle made of all sorts of fur, and besmeared
her face and hands with soot. Then she threw herself upon Heaven for
help in her need, and went away, and journeyed on the whole night, till
at last she came to a large wood. As she was very tired, she sat herself
down in the hollow of a tree and soon fell asleep: and there she slept
on till it was midday.

Now as the king to whom the wood belonged was hunting in it, his dogs
came to the tree, and began to snuff about, and run round and round, and
bark. ‘Look sharp!’ said the king to the huntsmen, ‘and see what sort
of game lies there.’ And the huntsmen went up to the tree, and when they
came back again said, ‘In the hollow tree there lies a most wonderful
beast, such as we never saw before; its skin seems to be of a thousand
kinds of fur, but there it lies fast asleep.’ ‘See,’ said the king, ‘if
you can catch it alive, and we will take it with us.’ So the huntsmen
took it up, and the maiden awoke and was greatly frightened, and said,
‘I am a poor child that has neither father nor mother left; have pity on
me and take me with you.’ Then they said, ‘Yes, Miss Cat-skin, you will
do for the kitchen; you can sweep up the ashes, and do things of that
sort.’ So they put her into the coach, and took her home to the king’s
palace. Then they showed her a little corner under the staircase, where
no light of day ever peeped in, and said, ‘Cat-skin, you may lie and
sleep there.’ And she was sent into the kitchen, and made to fetch wood
and water, to blow the fire, pluck the poultry, pick the herbs, sift the
ashes, and do all the dirty work.

Thus Cat-skin lived for a long time very sorrowfully. ‘Ah! pretty
princess!’ thought she, ‘what will now become of thee?’ But it happened
one day that a feast was to be held in the king’s castle, so she said to
the cook, ‘May I go up a little while and see what is going on? I will
take care and stand behind the door.’ And the cook said, ‘Yes, you may
go, but be back again in half an hour’s time, to rake out the ashes.’
Then she took her little lamp, and went into her cabin, and took off the
fur skin, and washed the soot from off her face and hands, so that her
beauty shone forth like the sun from behind the clouds. She next opened
her nutshell, and brought out of it the dress that shone like the sun,
and so went to the feast. Everyone made way for her, for nobody knew
her, and they thought she could be no less than a king’s daughter. But
the king came up to her, and held out his hand and danced with her; and
he thought in his heart, ‘I never saw any one half so beautiful.’

When the dance was at an end she curtsied; and when the king looked
round for her, she was gone, no one knew wither. The guards that stood
at the castle gate were called in: but they had seen no one. The truth
was, that she had run into her little cabin, pulled off her dress,
blackened her face and hands, put on the fur-skin cloak, and was
Cat-skin again. When she went into the kitchen to her work, and began
to rake the ashes, the cook said, ‘Let that alone till the morning, and
heat the king’s soup; I should like to run up now and give a peep: but
take care you don’t let a hair fall into it, or you will run a chance of
never eating again.’

As soon as the cook went away, Cat-skin heated the king’s soup, and
toasted a slice of bread first, as nicely as ever she could; and when it
was ready, she went and looked in the cabin for her little golden ring,
and put it into the dish in which the soup was. When the dance was over,
the king ordered his soup to be brought in; and it pleased him so well,
that he thought he had never tasted any so good before. At the bottom
he saw a gold ring lying; and as he could not make out how it had got
there, he ordered the cook to be sent for. The cook was frightened when
he heard the order, and said to Cat-skin, ‘You must have let a hair fall
into the soup; if it be so, you will have a good beating.’ Then he went
before the king, and he asked him who had cooked the soup. ‘I did,’
answered the cook. But the king said, ‘That is not true; it was better
done than you could do it.’ Then he answered, ‘To tell the truth I did
not cook it, but Cat-skin did.’ ‘Then let Cat-skin come up,’ said the
king: and when she came he said to her, ‘Who are you?’ ‘I am a poor
child,’ said she, ‘that has lost both father and mother.’ ‘How came you
in my palace?’ asked he. ‘I am good for nothing,’ said she, ‘but to be
scullion-girl, and to have boots and shoes thrown at my head.’ ‘But how
did you get the ring that was in the soup?’ asked the king. Then she
would not own that she knew anything about the ring; so the king sent
her away again about her business.

After a time there was another feast, and Cat-skin asked the cook to let
her go up and see it as before. ‘Yes,’ said he, ‘but come again in half
an hour, and cook the king the soup that he likes so much.’ Then she
ran to her little cabin, washed herself quickly, and took her dress
out which was silvery as the moon, and put it on; and when she went in,
looking like a king’s daughter, the king went up to her, and rejoiced at
seeing her again, and when the dance began he danced with her. After the
dance was at an end she managed to slip out, so slyly that the king did
not see where she was gone; but she sprang into her little cabin, and
made herself into Cat-skin again, and went into the kitchen to cook the
soup. Whilst the cook was above stairs, she got the golden necklace and
dropped it into the soup; then it was brought to the king, who ate it,
and it pleased him as well as before; so he sent for the cook, who
was again forced to tell him that Cat-skin had cooked it. Cat-skin was
brought again before the king, but she still told him that she was only
fit to have boots and shoes thrown at her head.

But when the king had ordered a feast to be got ready for the third
time, it happened just the same as before. ‘You must be a witch,
Cat-skin,’ said the cook; ‘for you always put something into your soup,
so that it pleases the king better than mine.’ However, he let her go up
as before. Then she put on her dress which sparkled like the stars, and
went into the ball-room in it; and the king danced with her again, and
thought she had never looked so beautiful as she did then. So whilst
he was dancing with her, he put a gold ring on her finger without her
seeing it, and ordered that the dance should be kept up a long time.
When it was at an end, he would have held her fast by the hand, but she
slipped away, and sprang so quickly through the crowd that he lost sight
of her: and she ran as fast as she could into her little cabin under
the stairs. But this time she kept away too long, and stayed beyond the
half-hour; so she had not time to take off her fine dress, and threw her
fur mantle over it, and in her haste did not blacken herself all over
with soot, but left one of her fingers white.

Then she ran into the kitchen, and cooked the king’s soup; and as soon
as the cook was gone, she put the golden brooch into the dish. When the
king got to the bottom, he ordered Cat-skin to be called once more, and
soon saw the white finger, and the ring that he had put on it whilst
they were dancing: so he seized her hand, and kept fast hold of it, and
when she wanted to loose herself and spring away, the fur cloak fell off
a little on one side, and the starry dress sparkled underneath it.

Then he got hold of the fur and tore it off, and her golden hair and
beautiful form were seen, and she could no longer hide herself: so she
washed the soot and ashes from her face, and showed herself to be the
most beautiful princess upon the face of the earth. But the king said,
‘You are my beloved bride, and we will never more be parted from each
other.’ And the wedding feast was held, and a merry day it was, as ever
was heard of or seen in that country, or indeed in any other.




SNOW-WHITE AND ROSE-RED

There was once a poor widow who lived in a lonely cottage. In front of
the cottage was a garden wherein stood two rose-trees, one of which bore
white and the other red roses. She had two children who were like the
two rose-trees, and one was called Snow-white, and the other Rose-red.
They were as good and happy, as busy and cheerful as ever two children
in the world were, only Snow-white was more quiet and gentle than
Rose-red. Rose-red liked better to run about in the meadows and fields
seeking flowers and catching butterflies; but Snow-white sat at home
with her mother, and helped her with her housework, or read to her when
there was nothing to do.

The two children were so fond of one another that they always held each
other by the hand when they went out together, and when Snow-white said:
‘We will not leave each other,’ Rose-red answered: ‘Never so long as we
live,’ and their mother would add: ‘What one has she must share with the
other.’

They often ran about the forest alone and gathered red berries, and no
beasts did them any harm, but came close to them trustfully. The little
hare would eat a cabbage-leaf out of their hands, the roe grazed by
their side, the stag leapt merrily by them, and the birds sat still upon
the boughs, and sang whatever they knew.

No mishap overtook them; if they had stayed too late in the forest, and
night came on, they laid themselves down near one another upon the moss,
and slept until morning came, and their mother knew this and did not
worry on their account.

Once when they had spent the night in the wood and the dawn had roused
them, they saw a beautiful child in a shining white dress sitting near
their bed. He got up and looked quite kindly at them, but said nothing
and went into the forest. And when they looked round they found that
they had been sleeping quite close to a precipice, and would certainly
have fallen into it in the darkness if they had gone only a few paces
further. And their mother told them that it must have been the angel who
watches over good children.

Snow-white and Rose-red kept their mother’s little cottage so neat that
it was a pleasure to look inside it. In the summer Rose-red took care
of the house, and every morning laid a wreath of flowers by her mother’s
bed before she awoke, in which was a rose from each tree. In the winter
Snow-white lit the fire and hung the kettle on the hob. The kettle
was of brass and shone like gold, so brightly was it polished. In the
evening, when the snowflakes fell, the mother said: ‘Go, Snow-white, and
bolt the door,’ and then they sat round the hearth, and the mother took
her spectacles and read aloud out of a large book, and the two girls
listened as they sat and spun. And close by them lay a lamb upon the
floor, and behind them upon a perch sat a white dove with its head
hidden beneath its wings.

One evening, as they were thus sitting comfortably together, someone
knocked at the door as if he wished to be let in. The mother said:
‘Quick, Rose-red, open the door, it must be a traveller who is seeking
shelter.’ Rose-red went and pushed back the bolt, thinking that it was a
poor man, but it was not; it was a bear that stretched his broad, black
head within the door.

Rose-red screamed and sprang back, the lamb bleated, the dove fluttered,
and Snow-white hid herself behind her mother’s bed. But the bear began
to speak and said: ‘Do not be afraid, I will do you no harm! I am
half-frozen, and only want to warm myself a little beside you.’

‘Poor bear,’ said the mother, ‘lie down by the fire, only take care that
you do not burn your coat.’ Then she cried: ‘Snow-white, Rose-red, come
out, the bear will do you no harm, he means well.’ So they both came
out, and by-and-by the lamb and dove came nearer, and were not afraid
of him. The bear said: ‘Here, children, knock the snow out of my coat a
little’; so they brought the broom and swept the bear’s hide clean;
and he stretched himself by the fire and growled contentedly and
comfortably. It was not long before they grew quite at home, and played
tricks with their clumsy guest. They tugged his hair with their hands,
put their feet upon his back and rolled him about, or they took a
hazel-switch and beat him, and when he growled they laughed. But the
bear took it all in good part, only when they were too rough he called
out: ‘Leave me alive, children,

Snow-white, Rose-red,
Will you beat your wooer dead?’

When it was bed-time, and the others went to bed, the mother said to the
bear: ‘You can lie there by the hearth, and then you will be safe from
the cold and the bad weather.’ As soon as day dawned the two children
let him out, and he trotted across the snow into the forest.

Henceforth the bear came every evening at the same time, laid himself
down by the hearth, and let the children amuse themselves with him as
much as they liked; and they got so used to him that the doors were
never fastened until their black friend had arrived.

When spring had come and all outside was green, the bear said one
morning to Snow-white: ‘Now I must go away, and cannot come back for the
whole summer.’ ‘Where are you going, then, dear bear?’ asked Snow-white.
‘I must go into the forest and guard my treasures from the wicked
dwarfs. In the winter, when the earth is frozen hard, they are obliged
to stay below and cannot work their way through; but now, when the sun
has thawed and warmed the earth, they break through it, and come out to
pry and steal; and what once gets into their hands, and in their caves,
does not easily see daylight again.’

Snow-white was quite sorry at his departure, and as she unbolted the
door for him, and the bear was hurrying out, he caught against the bolt
and a piece of his hairy coat was torn off, and it seemed to Snow-white
as if she had seen gold shining through it, but she was not sure about
it. The bear ran away quickly, and was soon out of sight behind the
trees.

A short time afterwards the mother sent her children into the forest
to get firewood. There they found a big tree which lay felled on the
ground, and close by the trunk something was jumping backwards and
forwards in the grass, but they could not make out what it was. When
they came nearer they saw a dwarf with an old withered face and a
snow-white beard a yard long. The end of the beard was caught in a
crevice of the tree, and the little fellow was jumping about like a dog
tied to a rope, and did not know what to do.

He glared at the girls with his fiery red eyes and cried: ‘Why do you
stand there? Can you not come here and help me?’ ‘What are you up to,
little man?’ asked Rose-red. ‘You stupid, prying goose!’ answered the
dwarf: ‘I was going to split the tree to get a little wood for cooking.
The little bit of food that we people get is immediately burnt up with
heavy logs; we do not swallow so much as you coarse, greedy folk. I had
just driven the wedge safely in, and everything was going as I wished;
but the cursed wedge was too smooth and suddenly sprang out, and the
tree closed so quickly that I could not pull out my beautiful white
beard; so now it is tight and I cannot get away, and the silly, sleek,
milk-faced things laugh! Ugh! how odious you are!’

The children tried very hard, but they could not pull the beard out, it
was caught too fast. ‘I will run and fetch someone,’ said Rose-red. ‘You
senseless goose!’ snarled the dwarf; ‘why should you fetch someone? You
are already two too many for me; can you not think of something better?’
‘Don’t be impatient,’ said Snow-white, ‘I will help you,’ and she pulled
her scissors out of her pocket, and cut off the end of the beard.

As soon as the dwarf felt himself free he laid hold of a bag which lay
amongst the roots of the tree, and which was full of gold, and lifted it
up, grumbling to himself: ‘Uncouth people, to cut off a piece of my fine
beard. Bad luck to you!’ and then he swung the bag upon his back, and
went off without even once looking at the children.

Some time afterwards Snow-white and Rose-red went to catch a dish
of fish. As they came near the brook they saw something like a large
grasshopper jumping towards the water, as if it were going to leap in.
They ran to it and found it was the dwarf. ‘Where are you going?’ said
Rose-red; ‘you surely don’t want to go into the water?’ ‘I am not such
a fool!’ cried the dwarf; ‘don’t you see that the accursed fish wants
to pull me in?’ The little man had been sitting there fishing, and
unluckily the wind had tangled up his beard with the fishing-line; a
moment later a big fish made a bite and the feeble creature had not
strength to pull it out; the fish kept the upper hand and pulled the
dwarf towards him. He held on to all the reeds and rushes, but it was of
little good, for he was forced to follow the movements of the fish, and
was in urgent danger of being dragged into the water.

The girls came just in time; they held him fast and tried to free his
beard from the line, but all in vain, beard and line were entangled fast
together. There was nothing to do but to bring out the scissors and cut
the beard, whereby a small part of it was lost. When the dwarf saw that
he screamed out: ‘Is that civil, you toadstool, to disfigure a man’s
face? Was it not enough to clip off the end of my beard? Now you have
cut off the best part of it. I cannot let myself be seen by my people.
I wish you had been made to run the soles off your shoes!’ Then he took
out a sack of pearls which lay in the rushes, and without another word
he dragged it away and disappeared behind a stone.

It happened that soon afterwards the mother sent the two children to the
town to buy needles and thread, and laces and ribbons. The road led them
across a heath upon which huge pieces of rock lay strewn about. There
they noticed a large bird hovering in the air, flying slowly round and
round above them; it sank lower and lower, and at last settled near a
rock not far away. Immediately they heard a loud, piteous cry. They ran
up and saw with horror that the eagle had seized their old acquaintance
the dwarf, and was going to carry him off.

The children, full of pity, at once took tight hold of the little man,
and pulled against the eagle so long that at last he let his booty go.
As soon as the dwarf had recovered from his first fright he cried
with his shrill voice: ‘Could you not have done it more carefully! You
dragged at my brown coat so that it is all torn and full of holes, you
clumsy creatures!’ Then he took up a sack full of precious stones, and
slipped away again under the rock into his hole. The girls, who by
this time were used to his ingratitude, went on their way and did their
business in town.

As they crossed the heath again on their way home they surprised the
dwarf, who had emptied out his bag of precious stones in a clean spot,
and had not thought that anyone would come there so late. The evening
sun shone upon the brilliant stones; they glittered and sparkled with
all colours so beautifully that the children stood still and stared
at them. ‘Why do you stand gaping there?’ cried the dwarf, and his
ashen-grey face became copper-red with rage. He was still cursing when a
loud growling was heard, and a black bear came trotting towards them out
of the forest. The dwarf sprang up in a fright, but he could not reach
his cave, for the bear was already close. Then in the dread of his heart
he cried: ‘Dear Mr Bear, spare me, I will give you all my treasures;
look, the beautiful jewels lying there! Grant me my life; what do you
want with such a slender little fellow as I? you would not feel me
between your teeth. Come, take these two wicked girls, they are tender
morsels for you, fat as young quails; for mercy’s sake eat them!’ The
bear took no heed of his words, but gave the wicked creature a single
blow with his paw, and he did not move again.

The girls had run away, but the bear called to them: ‘Snow-white and
Rose-red, do not be afraid; wait, I will come with you.’ Then they
recognized his voice and waited, and when he came up to them suddenly
his bearskin fell off, and he stood there a handsome man, clothed all in
gold. ‘I am a king’s son,’ he said, ‘and I was bewitched by that wicked
dwarf, who had stolen my treasures; I have had to run about the forest
as a savage bear 
until I was freed by his death. Now he has got his
well-deserved punishment.

Snow-white was married to him, and Rose-red to his brother, and they
divided between them the great treasure which the dwarf had gathered
together in his cave. The old mother lived peacefully and happily with
her children for many years. She took the two rose-trees with her, and
they stood before her window, and every year bore the most beautiful
roses, white and red.








THE ILIAD.





BOOK I.


ARGUMENT.(40)

THE CONTENTION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON.

In the war of Troy, the Greeks having sacked some of the neighbouring
towns, and taken from thence two beautiful captives, Chryseis and Briseis,
allotted the first to Agamemnon, and the last to Achilles. Chryses, the
father of Chryseis, and priest of Apollo, comes to the Grecian camp to
ransom her; with which the action of the poem opens, in the tenth year of
the siege. The priest being refused, and insolently dismissed by
Agamemnon, entreats for vengeance from his god; who inflicts a pestilence
on the Greeks. Achilles calls a council, and encourages Chalcas to declare
the cause of it; who attributes it to the refusal of Chryseis. The king,
being obliged to send back his captive, enters into a furious contest with
Achilles, which Nestor pacifies; however, as he had the absolute command
of the army, he seizes on Briseis in revenge. Achilles in discontent
withdraws himself and his forces from the rest of the Greeks; and
complaining to Thetis, she supplicates Jupiter to render them sensible of
the wrong done to her son, by giving victory to the Trojans. Jupiter,
granting her suit, incenses Juno: between whom the debate runs high, till
they are reconciled by the address of Vulcan.

The time of two-and-twenty days is taken up in this book: nine during the
plague, one in the council and quarrel of the princes, and twelve for
Jupiter's stay with the Ćthiopians, at whose return Thetis prefers her
petition. The scene lies in the Grecian camp, then changes to Chrysa, and
lastly to Olympus.

Achilles' wrath, to Greece the direful spring
Of woes unnumber'd, heavenly goddess, sing!
That wrath which hurl'd to Pluto's gloomy reign
The souls of mighty chiefs untimely slain;
Whose limbs unburied on the naked shore,
Devouring dogs and hungry vultures tore.(41)
Since great Achilles and Atrides strove,
Such was the sovereign doom, and such the will of Jove!(42)

Declare, O Muse! in what ill-fated hour(43)
Sprung the fierce strife, from what offended power
Latona's son a dire contagion spread,(44)
And heap'd the camp with mountains of the dead;
The king of men his reverent priest defied,(45)
And for the king's offence the people died.

For Chryses sought with costly gifts to gain
His captive daughter from the victor's chain.
Suppliant the venerable father stands;
Apollo's awful ensigns grace his hands
By these he begs; and lowly bending down,
Extends the sceptre and the laurel crown
He sued to all, but chief implored for grace
The brother-kings, of Atreus' royal race(46)

"Ye kings and warriors! may your vows be crown'd,
And Troy's proud walls lie level with the ground.
May Jove restore you when your toils are o'er
Safe to the pleasures of your native shore.
But, oh! relieve a wretched parent's pain,
And give Chryseis to these arms again;
If mercy fail, yet let my presents move,
And dread avenging Phoebus, son of Jove."

The Greeks in shouts their joint assent declare,
The priest to reverence, and release the fair.
Not so Atrides; he, with kingly pride,
Repulsed the sacred sire, and thus replied:

"Hence on thy life, and fly these hostile plains,
Nor ask, presumptuous, what the king detains
Hence, with thy laurel crown, and golden rod,
Nor trust too far those ensigns of thy god.
Mine is thy daughter, priest, and shall remain;
And prayers, and tears, and bribes, shall plead in vain;
Till time shall rifle every youthful grace,
And age dismiss her from my cold embrace,
In daily labours of the loom employ'd,
Or doom'd to deck the bed she once enjoy'd
Hence then; to Argos shall the maid retire,
Far from her native soil and weeping sire."

               [Illustration: HOMER INVOKING THE MUSE.]

                       HOMER INVOKING THE MUSE.


The trembling priest along the shore return'd,
And in the anguish of a father mourn'd.
Disconsolate, not daring to complain,
Silent he wander'd by the sounding main;
Till, safe at distance, to his god he prays,
The god who darts around the world his rays.

"O Smintheus! sprung from fair Latona's line,(47)
Thou guardian power of Cilla the divine,(48)
Thou source of light! whom Tenedos adores,
And whose bright presence gilds thy Chrysa's shores.
If e'er with wreaths I hung thy sacred fane,(49)
Or fed the flames with fat of oxen slain;
God of the silver bow! thy shafts employ,
Avenge thy servant, and the Greeks destroy."

Thus Chryses pray'd.--the favouring power attends,
And from Olympus' lofty tops descends.
Bent was his bow, the Grecian hearts to wound;(50)
Fierce as he moved, his silver shafts resound.
Breathing revenge, a sudden night he spread,
And gloomy darkness roll'd about his head.
The fleet in view, he twang'd his deadly bow,
And hissing fly the feather'd fates below.
On mules and dogs the infection first began;(51)
And last, the vengeful arrows fix'd in man.
For nine long nights, through all the dusky air,
The pyres, thick-flaming, shot a dismal glare.
But ere the tenth revolving day was run,
Inspired by Juno, Thetis' godlike son
Convened to council all the Grecian train;
For much the goddess mourn'd her heroes slain.(52)
The assembly seated, rising o'er the rest,
Achilles thus the king of men address'd:

"Why leave we not the fatal Trojan shore,
And measure back the seas we cross'd before?
The plague destroying whom the sword would spare,
'Tis time to save the few remains of war.
But let some prophet, or some sacred sage,
Explore the cause of great Apollo's rage;
Or learn the wasteful vengeance to remove
By mystic dreams, for dreams descend from Jove.(53)
If broken vows this heavy curse have laid,
Let altars smoke, and hecatombs be paid.
So Heaven, atoned, shall dying Greece restore,
And Phoebus dart his burning shafts no more."

He said, and sat: when Chalcas thus replied;
Chalcas the wise, the Grecian priest and guide,
That sacred seer, whose comprehensive view,
The past, the present, and the future knew:
Uprising slow, the venerable sage
Thus spoke the prudence and the fears of age:

"Beloved of Jove, Achilles! would'st thou know
Why angry Phoebus bends his fatal bow?
First give thy faith, and plight a prince's word
Of sure protection, by thy power and sword:
For I must speak what wisdom would conceal,
And truths, invidious to the great, reveal,
Bold is the task, when subjects, grown too wise,
Instruct a monarch where his error lies;
For though we deem the short-lived fury past,
'Tis sure the mighty will revenge at last."
To whom Pelides:--"From thy inmost soul
Speak what thou know'st, and speak without control.
E'en by that god I swear who rules the day,
To whom thy hands the vows of Greece convey.
And whose bless'd oracles thy lips declare;
Long as Achilles breathes this vital air,
No daring Greek, of all the numerous band,
Against his priest shall lift an impious hand;
Not e'en the chief by whom our hosts are led,
The king of kings, shall touch that sacred head."

Encouraged thus, the blameless man replies:
"Nor vows unpaid, nor slighted sacrifice,
But he, our chief, provoked the raging pest,
Apollo's vengeance for his injured priest.
Nor will the god's awaken'd fury cease,
But plagues shall spread, and funeral fires increase,
Till the great king, without a ransom paid,
To her own Chrysa send the black-eyed maid.(54)
Perhaps, with added sacrifice and prayer,
The priest may pardon, and the god may spare."

The prophet spoke: when with a gloomy frown
The monarch started from his shining throne;
Black choler fill'd his breast that boil'd with ire,
And from his eye-balls flash'd the living fire:
"Augur accursed! denouncing mischief still,
Prophet of plagues, for ever boding ill!
Still must that tongue some wounding message bring,
And still thy priestly pride provoke thy king?
For this are Phoebus' oracles explored,
To teach the Greeks to murmur at their lord?
For this with falsehood is my honour stain'd,
Is heaven offended, and a priest profaned;
Because my prize, my beauteous maid, I hold,
And heavenly charms prefer to proffer'd gold?
A maid, unmatch'd in manners as in face,
Skill'd in each art, and crown'd with every grace;
Not half so dear were Clytaemnestra's charms,
When first her blooming beauties bless'd my arms.
Yet, if the gods demand her, let her sail;
Our cares are only for the public weal:
Let me be deem'd the hateful cause of all,
And suffer, rather than my people fall.
The prize, the beauteous prize, I will resign,
So dearly valued, and so justly mine.
But since for common good I yield the fair,
My private loss let grateful Greece repair;
Nor unrewarded let your prince complain,
That he alone has fought and bled in vain."
"Insatiate king (Achilles thus replies),
Fond of the power, but fonder of the prize!
Would'st thou the Greeks their lawful prey should yield,
The due reward of many a well-fought field?

The spoils of cities razed and warriors slain,
We share with justice, as with toil we gain;
But to resume whate'er thy avarice craves
(That trick of tyrants) may be borne by slaves.
Yet if our chief for plunder only fight,
The spoils of Ilion shall thy loss requite,
Whene'er, by Jove's decree, our conquering powers
Shall humble to the dust her lofty towers."

Then thus the king: "Shall I my prize resign
With tame content, and thou possess'd of thine?
Great as thou art, and like a god in fight,
Think not to rob me of a soldier's right.
At thy demand shall I restore the maid?
First let the just equivalent be paid;
Such as a king might ask; and let it be
A treasure worthy her, and worthy me.
Or grant me this, or with a monarch's claim
This hand shall seize some other captive dame.
The mighty Ajax shall his prize resign;(55)
Ulysses' spoils, or even thy own, be mine.
The man who suffers, loudly may complain;
And rage he may, but he shall rage in vain.
But this when time requires.--It now remains
We launch a bark to plough the watery plains,
And waft the sacrifice to Chrysa's shores,
With chosen pilots, and with labouring oars.
Soon shall the fair the sable ship ascend,
And some deputed prince the charge attend:
This Creta's king, or Ajax shall fulfil,
Or wise Ulysses see perform'd our will;
Or, if our royal pleasure shall ordain,
Achilles' self conduct her o'er the main;
Let fierce Achilles, dreadful in his rage,
The god propitiate, and the pest assuage."

                        [Illustration: MARS.]

                                MARS.


At this, Pelides, frowning stern, replied:
"O tyrant, arm'd with insolence and pride!
Inglorious slave to interest, ever join'd
With fraud, unworthy of a royal mind!
What generous Greek, obedient to thy word,
Shall form an ambush, or shall lift the sword?
What cause have I to war at thy decree?
The distant Trojans never injured me;
To Phthia's realms no hostile troops they led:
Safe in her vales my warlike coursers fed;
Far hence removed, the hoarse-resounding main,
And walls of rocks, secure my native reign,
Whose fruitful soil luxuriant harvests grace,
Rich in her fruits, and in her martial race.
Hither we sail'd, a voluntary throng,
To avenge a private, not a public wrong:
What else to Troy the assembled nations draws,
But thine, ungrateful, and thy brother's cause?
Is this the pay our blood and toils deserve;
Disgraced and injured by the man we serve?
And darest thou threat to snatch my prize away,
Due to the deeds of many a dreadful day?
A prize as small, O tyrant! match'd with thine,
As thy own actions if compared to mine.
Thine in each conquest is the wealthy prey,
Though mine the sweat and danger of the day.
Some trivial present to my ships I bear:
Or barren praises pay the wounds of war.
But know, proud monarch, I'm thy slave no more;
My fleet shall waft me to Thessalia's shore:
Left by Achilles on the Trojan plain,
What spoils, what conquests, shall Atrides gain?"

To this the king: "Fly, mighty warrior! fly;
Thy aid we need not, and thy threats defy.
There want not chiefs in such a cause to fight,
And Jove himself shall guard a monarch's right.
Of all the kings (the god's distinguish'd care)
To power superior none such hatred bear:
Strife and debate thy restless soul employ,
And wars and horrors are thy savage joy,
If thou hast strength, 'twas Heaven that strength bestow'd;
For know, vain man! thy valour is from God.
Haste, launch thy vessels, fly with speed away;
Rule thy own realms with arbitrary sway;
I heed thee not, but prize at equal rate
Thy short-lived friendship, and thy groundless hate.
Go, threat thy earth-born Myrmidons:--but here(56)
'Tis mine to threaten, prince, and thine to fear.
Know, if the god the beauteous dame demand,
My bark shall waft her to her native land;
But then prepare, imperious prince! prepare,
Fierce as thou art, to yield thy captive fair:
Even in thy tent I'll seize the blooming prize,
Thy loved Briseis with the radiant eyes.
Hence shalt thou prove my might, and curse the hour
Thou stood'st a rival of imperial power;
And hence, to all our hosts it shall be known,
That kings are subject to the gods alone."

Achilles heard, with grief and rage oppress'd,
His heart swell'd high, and labour'd in his breast;
Distracting thoughts by turns his bosom ruled;
Now fired by wrath, and now by reason cool'd:
That prompts his hand to draw the deadly sword,
Force through the Greeks, and pierce their haughty lord;
This whispers soft his vengeance to control,
And calm the rising tempest of his soul.
Just as in anguish of suspense he stay'd,
While half unsheathed appear'd the glittering blade,(57)
Minerva swift descended from above,
Sent by the sister and the wife of Jove
(For both the princes claim'd her equal care);
Behind she stood, and by the golden hair
Achilles seized; to him alone confess'd;
A sable cloud conceal'd her from the rest.
He sees, and sudden to the goddess cries,
Known by the flames that sparkle from her eyes:

       [Illustration: MINERVA REPRESSING THE FURY OF ACHILLES.]

               MINERVA REPRESSING THE FURY OF ACHILLES.


"Descends Minerva, in her guardian care,
A heavenly witness of the wrongs I bear
From Atreus' son?--Then let those eyes that view
The daring crime, behold the vengeance too."

"Forbear (the progeny of Jove replies)
To calm thy fury I forsake the skies:
Let great Achilles, to the gods resign'd,
To reason yield the empire o'er his mind.
By awful Juno this command is given;
The king and you are both the care of heaven.
The force of keen reproaches let him feel;
But sheathe, obedient, thy revenging steel.
For I pronounce (and trust a heavenly power)
Thy injured honour has its fated hour,
When the proud monarch shall thy arms implores
And bribe thy friendship with a boundless store.
Then let revenge no longer bear the sway;
Command thy passions, and the gods obey."

To her Pelides:--"With regardful ear,
'Tis just, O goddess! I thy dictates hear.
Hard as it is, my vengeance I suppress:
Those who revere the gods the gods will bless."
He said, observant of the blue-eyed maid;
Then in the sheath return'd the shining blade.
The goddess swift to high Olympus flies,
And joins the sacred senate of the skies.

Nor yet the rage his boiling breast forsook,
Which thus redoubling on Atrides broke:
"O monster! mix'd of insolence and fear,
Thou dog in forehead, but in heart a deer!
When wert thou known in ambush'd fights to dare,
Or nobly face the horrid front of war?
'Tis ours, the chance of fighting fields to try;
Thine to look on, and bid the valiant die:
So much 'tis safer through the camp to go,
And rob a subject, than despoil a foe.
Scourge of thy people, violent and base!
Sent in Jove's anger on a slavish race;
Who, lost to sense of generous freedom past,
Are tamed to wrongs;--or this had been thy last.
Now by this sacred sceptre hear me swear,
Which never more shall leaves or blossoms bear,
Which sever'd from the trunk (as I from thee)
On the bare mountains left its parent tree;
This sceptre, form'd by temper'd steel to prove
An ensign of the delegates of Jove,
From whom the power of laws and justice springs
(Tremendous oath! inviolate to kings);
By this I swear:--when bleeding Greece again
Shall call Achilles, she shall call in vain.
When, flush'd with slaughter, Hector comes to spread
The purpled shore with mountains of the dead,
Then shall thou mourn the affront thy madness gave,
Forced to deplore when impotent to save:
Then rage in bitterness of soul to know
This act has made the bravest Greek thy foe."

He spoke; and furious hurl'd against the ground
His sceptre starr'd with golden studs around:
Then sternly silent sat. With like disdain
The raging king return'd his frowns again.

To calm their passion with the words of age,
Slow from his seat arose the Pylian sage,
Experienced Nestor, in persuasion skill'd;
Words, sweet as honey, from his lips distill'd:(58)
Two generations now had pass'd away,
Wise by his rules, and happy by his sway;
Two ages o'er his native realm he reign'd,
And now the example of the third remain'd.
All view'd with awe the venerable man;
Who thus with mild benevolence began:--

"What shame, what woe is this to Greece! what joy
To Troy's proud monarch, and the friends of Troy!
That adverse gods commit to stern debate
The best, the bravest, of the Grecian state.
Young as ye are, this youthful heat restrain,
Nor think your Nestor's years and wisdom vain.
A godlike race of heroes once I knew,
Such as no more these aged eyes shall view!
Lives there a chief to match Pirithous' fame,
Dryas the bold, or Ceneus' deathless name;
Theseus, endued with more than mortal might,
Or Polyphemus, like the gods in fight?
With these of old, to toils of battle bred,
In early youth my hardy days I led;
Fired with the thirst which virtuous envy breeds,
And smit with love of honourable deeds,
Strongest of men, they pierced the mountain boar,
Ranged the wild deserts red with monsters' gore,
And from their hills the shaggy Centaurs tore:
Yet these with soft persuasive arts I sway'd;
When Nestor spoke, they listen'd and obey'd.
If in my youth, even these esteem'd me wise;
Do you, young warriors, hear my age advise.
Atrides, seize not on the beauteous slave;
That prize the Greeks by common suffrage gave:
Nor thou, Achilles, treat our prince with pride;
Let kings be just, and sovereign power preside.
Thee, the first honours of the war adorn,
Like gods in strength, and of a goddess born;
Him, awful majesty exalts above
The powers of earth, and sceptred sons of Jove.
Let both unite with well-consenting mind,
So shall authority with strength be join'd.
Leave me, O king! to calm Achilles' rage;
Rule thou thyself, as more advanced in age.
Forbid it, gods! Achilles should be lost,
The pride of Greece, and bulwark of our host."

This said, he ceased. The king of men replies:
"Thy years are awful, and thy words are wise.
But that imperious, that unconquer'd soul,
No laws can limit, no respect control.
Before his pride must his superiors fall;
His word the law, and he the lord of all?
Him must our hosts, our chiefs, ourself obey?
What king can bear a rival in his sway?
Grant that the gods his matchless force have given;
Has foul reproach a privilege from heaven?"

Here on the monarch's speech Achilles broke,
And furious, thus, and interrupting spoke:
"Tyrant, I well deserved thy galling chain,
To live thy slave, and still to serve in vain,
Should I submit to each unjust decree:--
Command thy vassals, but command not me.
Seize on Briseis, whom the Grecians doom'd
My prize of war, yet tamely see resumed;
And seize secure; no more Achilles draws
His conquering sword in any woman's cause.
The gods command me to forgive the past:
But let this first invasion be the last:
For know, thy blood, when next thou darest invade,
Shall stream in vengeance on my reeking blade."

At this they ceased: the stern debate expired:
The chiefs in sullen majesty retired.

Achilles with Patroclus took his way
Where near his tents his hollow vessels lay.
Meantime Atrides launch'd with numerous oars
A well-rigg'd ship for Chrysa's sacred shores:
High on the deck was fair Chryseis placed,
And sage Ulysses with the conduct graced:
Safe in her sides the hecatomb they stow'd,
Then swiftly sailing, cut the liquid road.

The host to expiate next the king prepares,
With pure lustrations, and with solemn prayers.
Wash'd by the briny wave, the pious train(59)
Are cleansed; and cast the ablutions in the main.
Along the shore whole hecatombs were laid,
And bulls and goats to Phoebus' altars paid;
The sable fumes in curling spires arise,
And waft their grateful odours to the skies.

The army thus in sacred rites engaged,
Atrides still with deep resentment raged.
To wait his will two sacred heralds stood,
Talthybius and Eurybates the good.
"Haste to the fierce Achilles' tent (he cries),
Thence bear Briseis as our royal prize:
Submit he must; or if they will not part,
Ourself in arms shall tear her from his heart."

The unwilling heralds act their lord's commands;
Pensive they walk along the barren sands:
Arrived, the hero in his tent they find,
With gloomy aspect on his arm reclined.
At awful distance long they silent stand,
Loth to advance, and speak their hard command;
Decent confusion! This the godlike man
Perceived, and thus with accent mild began:

"With leave and honour enter our abodes,
Ye sacred ministers of men and gods!(60)
I know your message; by constraint you came;
Not you, but your imperious lord I blame.
Patroclus, haste, the fair Briseis bring;
Conduct my captive to the haughty king.
But witness, heralds, and proclaim my vow,
Witness to gods above, and men below!
But first, and loudest, to your prince declare
(That lawless tyrant whose commands you bear),
Unmoved as death Achilles shall remain,
Though prostrate Greece shall bleed at every vein:
The raging chief in frantic passion lost,
Blind to himself, and useless to his host,
Unskill'd to judge the future by the past,
In blood and slaughter shall repent at last."

 [Illustration: THE DEPARTURE OF BRISEIS FROM THE TENT OF ACHILLES.]

         THE DEPARTURE OF BRISEIS FROM THE TENT OF ACHILLES.


Patroclus now the unwilling beauty brought;
She, in soft sorrows, and in pensive thought,
Pass'd silent, as the heralds held her hand,
And of look'd back, slow-moving o'er the strand.
Not so his loss the fierce Achilles bore;
But sad, retiring to the sounding shore,
O'er the wild margin of the deep he hung,
That kindred deep from whence his mother sprung:(61)
There bathed in tears of anger and disdain,
Thus loud lamented to the stormy main:

"O parent goddess! since in early bloom
Thy son must fall, by too severe a doom;
Sure to so short a race of glory born,
Great Jove in justice should this span adorn:
Honour and fame at least the thunderer owed;
And ill he pays the promise of a god,
If yon proud monarch thus thy son defies,
Obscures my glories, and resumes my prize."

Far from the deep recesses of the main,
Where aged Ocean holds his watery reign,
The goddess-mother heard. The waves divide;
And like a mist she rose above the tide;
Beheld him mourning on the naked shores,
And thus the sorrows of his soul explores.
"Why grieves my son? Thy anguish let me share;
Reveal the cause, and trust a parent's care."

He deeply sighing said: "To tell my woe
Is but to mention what too well you know.
From Thebe, sacred to Apollo's name(62)
(Aetion's realm), our conquering army came,
With treasure loaded and triumphant spoils,
Whose just division crown'd the soldier's toils;
But bright Chryseis, heavenly prize! was led,
By vote selected, to the general's bed.
The priest of Phoebus sought by gifts to gain
His beauteous daughter from the victor's chain;
The fleet he reach'd, and, lowly bending down,
Held forth the sceptre and the laurel crown,
Intreating all; but chief implored for grace
The brother-kings of Atreus' royal race:
The generous Greeks their joint consent declare,
The priest to reverence, and release the fair;
Not so Atrides: he, with wonted pride,
The sire insulted, and his gifts denied:
The insulted sire (his god's peculiar care)
To Phoebus pray'd, and Phoebus heard the prayer:
A dreadful plague ensues: the avenging darts
Incessant fly, and pierce the Grecian hearts.
A prophet then, inspired by heaven, arose,
And points the crime, and thence derives the woes:
Myself the first the assembled chiefs incline
To avert the vengeance of the power divine;
Then rising in his wrath, the monarch storm'd;
Incensed he threaten'd, and his threats perform'd:
The fair Chryseis to her sire was sent,
With offer'd gifts to make the god relent;
But now he seized Briseis' heavenly charms,
And of my valour's prize defrauds my arms,
Defrauds the votes of all the Grecian train;(63)
And service, faith, and justice, plead in vain.
But, goddess! thou thy suppliant son attend.
To high Olympus' shining court ascend,
Urge all the ties to former service owed,
And sue for vengeance to the thundering god.
Oft hast thou triumph'd in the glorious boast,
That thou stood'st forth of all the ethereal host,
When bold rebellion shook the realms above,
The undaunted guard of cloud-compelling Jove:
When the bright partner of his awful reign,
The warlike maid, and monarch of the main,
The traitor-gods, by mad ambition driven,
Durst threat with chains the omnipotence of Heaven.
Then, call'd by thee, the monster Titan came
(Whom gods Briareus, men Ćgeon name),
Through wondering skies enormous stalk'd along;
Not he that shakes the solid earth so strong:
With giant-pride at Jove's high throne he stands,
And brandish'd round him all his hundred hands:
The affrighted gods confess'd their awful lord,
They dropp'd the fetters, trembled, and adored.(64)
This, goddess, this to his remembrance call,
Embrace his knees, at his tribunal fall;
Conjure him far to drive the Grecian train,
To hurl them headlong to their fleet and main,
To heap the shores with copious death, and bring
The Greeks to know the curse of such a king.
Let Agamemnon lift his haughty head
O'er all his wide dominion of the dead,
And mourn in blood that e'er he durst disgrace
The boldest warrior of the Grecian race."

[Illustration: THETIS CALLING BRIAREUS TO THE ASSISTANCE OF JUPITER.]

        THETIS CALLING BRIAREUS TO THE ASSISTANCE OF JUPITER.


"Unhappy son! (fair Thetis thus replies,
While tears celestial trickle from her eyes)
Why have I borne thee with a mother's throes,
To Fates averse, and nursed for future woes?(65)
So short a space the light of heaven to view!
So short a space! and fill'd with sorrow too!
O might a parent's careful wish prevail,
Far, far from Ilion should thy vessels sail,
And thou, from camps remote, the danger shun
Which now, alas! too nearly threats my son.
Yet (what I can) to move thy suit I'll go
To great Olympus crown'd with fleecy snow.
Meantime, secure within thy ships, from far
Behold the field, not mingle in the war.
The sire of gods and all the ethereal train,
On the warm limits of the farthest main,
Now mix with mortals, nor disdain to grace
The feasts of Ćthiopia's blameless race,(66)
Twelve days the powers indulge the genial rite,
Returning with the twelfth revolving light.
Then will I mount the brazen dome, and move
The high tribunal of immortal Jove."

The goddess spoke: the rolling waves unclose;
Then down the steep she plunged from whence she rose,
And left him sorrowing on the lonely coast,
In wild resentment for the fair he lost.

In Chrysa's port now sage Ulysses rode;
Beneath the deck the destined victims stow'd:
The sails they furl'd, they lash the mast aside,
And dropp'd their anchors, and the pinnace tied.
Next on the shore their hecatomb they land;
Chryseis last descending on the strand.
Her, thus returning from the furrow'd main,
Ulysses led to Phoebus' sacred fane;
Where at his solemn altar, as the maid
He gave to Chryses, thus the hero said:

"Hail, reverend priest! to Phoebus' awful dome
A suppliant I from great Atrides come:
Unransom'd, here receive the spotless fair;
Accept the hecatomb the Greeks prepare;
And may thy god who scatters darts around,
Atoned by sacrifice, desist to wound."(67)

At this, the sire embraced the maid again,
So sadly lost, so lately sought in vain.
Then near the altar of the darting king,
Disposed in rank their hecatomb they bring;
With water purify their hands, and take
The sacred offering of the salted cake;
While thus with arms devoutly raised in air,
And solemn voice, the priest directs his prayer:

"God of the silver bow, thy ear incline,
Whose power incircles Cilla the divine;
Whose sacred eye thy Tenedos surveys,
And gilds fair Chrysa with distinguish'd rays!
If, fired to vengeance at thy priest's request,
Thy direful darts inflict the raging pest:
Once more attend! avert the wasteful woe,
And smile propitious, and unbend thy bow."

So Chryses pray'd. Apollo heard his prayer:
And now the Greeks their hecatomb prepare;
Between their horns the salted barley threw,
And, with their heads to heaven, the victims slew:(68)
The limbs they sever from the inclosing hide;
The thighs, selected to the gods, divide:
On these, in double cauls involved with art,
The choicest morsels lay from every part.
The priest himself before his altar stands,
And burns the offering with his holy hands.
Pours the black wine, and sees the flames aspire;
The youth with instruments surround the fire:
The thighs thus sacrificed, and entrails dress'd,
The assistants part, transfix, and roast the rest:
Then spread the tables, the repast prepare;
Each takes his seat, and each receives his share.
When now the rage of hunger was repress'd,
With pure libations they conclude the feast;
The youths with wine the copious goblets crown'd,
And, pleased, dispense the flowing bowls around;(69)
With hymns divine the joyous banquet ends,
The paeans lengthen'd till the sun descends:
The Greeks, restored, the grateful notes prolong;
Apollo listens, and approves the song.

'Twas night; the chiefs beside their vessel lie,
Till rosy morn had purpled o'er the sky:
Then launch, and hoist the mast: indulgent gales,
Supplied by Phoebus, fill the swelling sails;
The milk-white canvas bellying as they blow,
The parted ocean foams and roars below:
Above the bounding billows swift they flew,
Till now the Grecian camp appear'd in view.
Far on the beach they haul their bark to land,
(The crooked keel divides the yellow sand,)
Then part, where stretch'd along the winding bay,
The ships and tents in mingled prospect lay.

But raging still, amidst his navy sat
The stern Achilles, stedfast in his hate;
Nor mix'd in combat, nor in council join'd;
But wasting cares lay heavy on his mind:
In his black thoughts revenge and slaughter roll,
And scenes of blood rise dreadful in his soul.

Twelve days were past, and now the dawning light
The gods had summon'd to the Olympian height:
Jove, first ascending from the watery bowers,
Leads the long order of ethereal powers.
When, like the morning-mist in early day,
Rose from the flood the daughter of the sea:
And to the seats divine her flight address'd.
There, far apart, and high above the rest,
The thunderer sat; where old Olympus shrouds
His hundred heads in heaven, and props the clouds.
Suppliant the goddess stood: one hand she placed
Beneath his beard, and one his knees embraced.
"If e'er, O father of the gods! (she said)
My words could please thee, or my actions aid,
Some marks of honour on my son bestow,
And pay in glory what in life you owe.
Fame is at least by heavenly promise due
To life so short, and now dishonour'd too.
Avenge this wrong, O ever just and wise!
Let Greece be humbled, and the Trojans rise;
Till the proud king and all the Achaian race
Shall heap with honours him they now disgrace."

    [Illustration: THETIS ENTREATING JUPITER TO HONOUR ACHILLES.]

            THETIS ENTREATING JUPITER TO HONOUR ACHILLES.


Thus Thetis spoke; but Jove in silence held
The sacred counsels of his breast conceal'd.
Not so repulsed, the goddess closer press'd,
Still grasp'd his knees, and urged the dear request.
"O sire of gods and men! thy suppliant hear;
Refuse, or grant; for what has Jove to fear?
Or oh! declare, of all the powers above,
Is wretched Thetis least the care of Jove?"

She said; and, sighing, thus the god replies,
Who rolls the thunder o'er the vaulted skies:

"What hast thou ask'd? ah, why should Jove engage
In foreign contests and domestic rage,
The gods' complaints, and Juno's fierce alarms,
While I, too partial, aid the Trojan arms?
Go, lest the haughty partner of my sway
With jealous eyes thy close access survey;
But part in peace, secure thy prayer is sped:
Witness the sacred honours of our head,
The nod that ratifies the will divine,
The faithful, fix'd, irrevocable sign;
This seals thy suit, and this fulfils thy vows--"
He spoke, and awful bends his sable brows,(70)
Shakes his ambrosial curls, and gives the nod,
The stamp of fate and sanction of the god:
High heaven with trembling the dread signal took,
And all Olympus to the centre shook.(71)

Swift to the seas profound the goddess flies,
Jove to his starry mansions in the skies.
The shining synod of the immortals wait
The coming god, and from their thrones of state
Arising silent, wrapp'd in holy fear,
Before the majesty of heaven appear.
Trembling they stand, while Jove assumes the throne,
All, but the god's imperious queen alone:
Late had she view'd the silver-footed dame,
And all her passions kindled into flame.
"Say, artful manager of heaven (she cries),
Who now partakes the secrets of the skies?
Thy Juno knows not the decrees of fate,
In vain the partner of imperial state.
What favourite goddess then those cares divides,
Which Jove in prudence from his consort hides?"

To this the thunderer: "Seek not thou to find
The sacred counsels of almighty mind:
Involved in darkness likes the great decree,
Nor can the depths of fate be pierced by thee.
What fits thy knowledge, thou the first shalt know;
The first of gods above, and men below;
But thou, nor they, shall search the thoughts that roll
Deep in the close recesses of my soul."

Full on the sire the goddess of the skies
Roll'd the large orbs of her majestic eyes,
And thus return'd:--"Austere Saturnius, say,
From whence this wrath, or who controls thy sway?
Thy boundless will, for me, remains in force,
And all thy counsels take the destined course.
But 'tis for Greece I fear: for late was seen,
In close consult, the silver-footed queen.
Jove to his Thetis nothing could deny,
Nor was the signal vain that shook the sky.
What fatal favour has the goddess won,
To grace her fierce, inexorable son?
Perhaps in Grecian blood to drench the plain,
And glut his vengeance with my people slain."

Then thus the god: "O restless fate of pride,
That strives to learn what heaven resolves to hide;
Vain is the search, presumptuous and abhorr'd,
Anxious to thee, and odious to thy lord.
Let this suffice: the immutable decree
No force can shake: what is, that ought to be.
Goddess, submit; nor dare our will withstand,
But dread the power of this avenging hand:
The united strength of all the gods above
In vain resists the omnipotence of Jove."

                       [Illustration: VULCAN.]

                               VULCAN.


The thunderer spoke, nor durst the queen reply;
A reverent horror silenced all the sky.
The feast disturb'd, with sorrow Vulcan saw
His mother menaced, and the gods in awe;
Peace at his heart, and pleasure his design,
Thus interposed the architect divine:
"The wretched quarrels of the mortal state
Are far unworthy, gods! of your debate:
Let men their days in senseless strife employ,
We, in eternal peace and constant joy.
Thou, goddess-mother, with our sire comply,
Nor break the sacred union of the sky:
Lest, roused to rage, he shake the bless'd abodes,
Launch the red lightning, and dethrone the gods.
If you submit, the thunderer stands appeased;
The gracious power is willing to be pleased."

Thus Vulcan spoke: and rising with a bound,
The double bowl with sparkling nectar crown'd,(72)
Which held to Juno in a cheerful way,
"Goddess (he cried), be patient and obey.
Dear as you are, if Jove his arm extend,
I can but grieve, unable to defend
What god so daring in your aid to move,
Or lift his hand against the force of Jove?
Once in your cause I felt his matchless might,
Hurl'd headlong down from the ethereal height;(73)
Toss'd all the day in rapid circles round,
Nor till the sun descended touch'd the ground.
Breathless I fell, in giddy motion lost;
The Sinthians raised me on the Lemnian coast;(74)

He said, and to her hands the goblet heaved,
Which, with a smile, the white-arm'd queen received
Then, to the rest he fill'd; and in his turn,
Each to his lips applied the nectar'd urn,
Vulcan with awkward grace his office plies,
And unextinguish'd laughter shakes the skies.

Thus the blest gods the genial day prolong,
In feasts ambrosial, and celestial song.(75)
Apollo tuned the lyre; the Muses round
With voice alternate aid the silver sound.
Meantime the radiant sun to mortal sight
Descending swift, roll'd down the rapid light:
Then to their starry domes the gods depart,
The shining monuments of Vulcan's art:
Jove on his couch reclined his awful head,
And Juno slumber'd on the golden bed.

BOOK II.


ARGUMENT.

THE TRIAL OF THE ARMY, AND CATALOGUE OF THE FORCES.

Jupiter, in pursuance of the request of Thetis, sends a deceitful vision
to Agamemnon, persuading him to lead the army to battle, in order to make
the Greeks sensible of their want of Achilles. The general, who is deluded
with the hopes of taking Troy without his assistance, but fears the army
was discouraged by his absence, and the late plague, as well as by the
length of time, contrives to make trial of their disposition by a
stratagem. He first communicates his design to the princes in council,
that he would propose a return to the soldiers, and that they should put a
stop to them if the proposal was embraced. Then he assembles the whole
host, and upon moving for a return to Greece, they unanimously agree to
it, and run to prepare the ships. They are detained by the management of
Ulysses, who chastises the insolence of Thersites. The assembly is
recalled, several speeches made on the occasion, and at length the advice
of Nestor followed, which was to make a general muster of the troops, and
to divide them into their several nations, before they proceeded to
battle. This gives occasion to the poet to enumerate all the forces of the
Greeks and Trojans, and in a large catalogue.

The time employed in this book consists not entirely of one day. The scene
lies in the Grecian camp, and upon the sea-shore; towards the end it
removes to Troy.

Now pleasing sleep had seal'd each mortal eye,
Stretch'd in the tents the Grecian leaders lie:
The immortals slumber'd on their thrones above;
All, but the ever-wakeful eyes of Jove.(76)
To honour Thetis' son he bends his care,
And plunge the Greeks in all the woes of war:
Then bids an empty phantom rise to sight,
And thus commands the vision of the night.

"Fly hence, deluding Dream! and light as air,(77)
To Agamemnon's ample tent repair.
Bid him in arms draw forth the embattled train,
Lead all his Grecians to the dusty plain.
Declare, e'en now 'tis given him to destroy
The lofty towers of wide-extended Troy.
For now no more the gods with fate contend,
At Juno's suit the heavenly factions end.
Destruction hangs o'er yon devoted wall,
And nodding Ilion waits the impending fall."

Swift as the word the vain illusion fled,
Descends, and hovers o'er Atrides' head;
Clothed in the figure of the Pylian sage,
Renown'd for wisdom, and revered for age:
Around his temples spreads his golden wing,
And thus the flattering dream deceives the king.

     [Illustration: JUPITER SENDING THE EVIL DREAM TO AGAMEMNON.]

             JUPITER SENDING THE EVIL DREAM TO AGAMEMNON.


"Canst thou, with all a monarch's cares oppress'd,
O Atreus' son! canst thou indulge the rest?(78)
Ill fits a chief who mighty nations guides,
Directs in council, and in war presides,
To whom its safety a whole people owes,
To waste long nights in indolent repose.(79)
Monarch, awake! 'tis Jove's command I bear;
Thou, and thy glory, claim his heavenly care.
In just array draw forth the embattled train,
Lead all thy Grecians to the dusty plain;
E'en now, O king! 'tis given thee to destroy
The lofty towers of wide-extended Troy.
For now no more the gods with fate contend,
At Juno's suit the heavenly factions end.
Destruction hangs o'er yon devoted wall,
And nodding Ilion waits the impending fall.
Awake, but waking this advice approve,
And trust the vision that descends from Jove."

The phantom said; then vanish'd from his sight,
Resolves to air, and mixes with the night.
A thousand schemes the monarch's mind employ;
Elate in thought he sacks untaken Troy:
Vain as he was, and to the future blind,
Nor saw what Jove and secret fate design'd,
What mighty toils to either host remain,
What scenes of grief, and numbers of the slain!
Eager he rises, and in fancy hears
The voice celestial murmuring in his ears.
First on his limbs a slender vest he drew,
Around him next the regal mantle threw,
The embroider'd sandals on his feet were tied;
The starry falchion glitter'd at his side;
And last, his arm the massy sceptre loads,
Unstain'd, immortal, and the gift of gods.

Now rosy Morn ascends the court of Jove,
Lifts up her light, and opens day above.
The king despatch'd his heralds with commands
To range the camp and summon all the bands:
The gathering hosts the monarch's word obey;
While to the fleet Atrides bends his way.
In his black ship the Pylian prince he found;
There calls a senate of the peers around:
The assembly placed, the king of men express'd
The counsels labouring in his artful breast.

"Friends and confederates! with attentive ear
Receive my words, and credit what you hear.
Late as I slumber'd in the shades of night,
A dream divine appear'd before my sight;
Whose visionary form like Nestor came,
The same in habit, and in mien the same.(80)
The heavenly phantom hover'd o'er my head,
'And, dost thou sleep, O Atreus' son? (he said)
Ill fits a chief who mighty nations guides,
Directs in council, and in war presides;
To whom its safety a whole people owes,
To waste long nights in indolent repose.
Monarch, awake! 'tis Jove's command I bear,
Thou and thy glory claim his heavenly care.
In just array draw forth the embattled train,
And lead the Grecians to the dusty plain;
E'en now, O king! 'tis given thee to destroy
The lofty towers of wide-extended Troy.
For now no more the gods with fate contend,
At Juno's suit the heavenly factions end.
Destruction hangs o'er yon devoted wall,
And nodding Ilion waits the impending fall.

This hear observant, and the gods obey!'
The vision spoke, and pass'd in air away.
Now, valiant chiefs! since heaven itself alarms,
Unite, and rouse the sons of Greece to arms.
But first, with caution, try what yet they dare,
Worn with nine years of unsuccessful war.
To move the troops to measure back the main,
Be mine; and yours the province to detain."

He spoke, and sat: when Nestor, rising said,
(Nestor, whom Pylos' sandy realms obey'd,)
"Princes of Greece, your faithful ears incline,
Nor doubt the vision of the powers divine;
Sent by great Jove to him who rules the host,
Forbid it, heaven! this warning should be lost!
Then let us haste, obey the god's alarms,
And join to rouse the sons of Greece to arms."

Thus spoke the sage: the kings without delay
Dissolve the council, and their chief obey:
The sceptred rulers lead; the following host,
Pour'd forth by thousands, darkens all the coast.
As from some rocky cleft the shepherd sees
Clustering in heaps on heaps the driving bees,
Rolling and blackening, swarms succeeding swarms,
With deeper murmurs and more hoarse alarms;
Dusky they spread, a close embodied crowd,
And o'er the vale descends the living cloud.(81)
So, from the tents and ships, a lengthen'd train
Spreads all the beach, and wide o'ershades the plain:
Along the region runs a deafening sound;
Beneath their footsteps groans the trembling ground.
Fame flies before the messenger of Jove,
And shining soars, and claps her wings above.
Nine sacred heralds now, proclaiming loud(82)
The monarch's will, suspend the listening crowd.
Soon as the throngs in order ranged appear,
And fainter murmurs died upon the ear,
The king of kings his awful figure raised:
High in his hand the golden sceptre blazed;
The golden sceptre, of celestial flame,
By Vulcan form'd, from Jove to Hermes came.
To Pelops he the immortal gift resign'd;
The immortal gift great Pelops left behind,
In Atreus' hand, which not with Atreus ends,
To rich Thyestes next the prize descends;
And now the mark of Agamemnon's reign,
Subjects all Argos, and controls the main.(83)

On this bright sceptre now the king reclined,
And artful thus pronounced the speech design'd:
"Ye sons of Mars, partake your leader's care,
Heroes of Greece, and brothers of the war!
Of partial Jove with justice I complain,
And heavenly oracles believed in vain
A safe return was promised to our toils,
Renown'd, triumphant, and enrich'd with spoils.
Now shameful flight alone can save the host,
Our blood, our treasure, and our glory lost.
So Jove decrees, resistless lord of all!
At whose command whole empires rise or fall:
He shakes the feeble props of human trust,
And towns and armies humbles to the dust
What shame to Greece a fruitful war to wage,
Oh, lasting shame in every future age!
Once great in arms, the common scorn we grow,
Repulsed and baffled by a feeble foe.
So small their number, that if wars were ceased,
And Greece triumphant held a general feast,
All rank'd by tens, whole decades when they dine
Must want a Trojan slave to pour the wine.(84)
But other forces have our hopes o'erthrown,
And Troy prevails by armies not her own.
Now nine long years of mighty Jove are run,
Since first the labours of this war begun:
Our cordage torn, decay'd our vessels lie,
And scarce insure the wretched power to fly.
Haste, then, for ever leave the Trojan wall!
Our weeping wives, our tender children call:
Love, duty, safety, summon us away,
'Tis nature's voice, and nature we obey,
Our shatter'd barks may yet transport us o'er,
Safe and inglorious, to our native shore.
Fly, Grecians, fly, your sails and oars employ,
And dream no more of heaven-defended Troy."

His deep design unknown, the hosts approve
Atrides' speech. The mighty numbers move.
So roll the billows to the Icarian shore,
From east and south when winds begin to roar,
Burst their dark mansions in the clouds, and sweep
The whitening surface of the ruffled deep.
And as on corn when western gusts descend,(85)
Before the blast the lofty harvests bend:
Thus o'er the field the moving host appears,
With nodding plumes and groves of waving spears.
The gathering murmur spreads, their trampling feet
Beat the loose sands, and thicken to the fleet;
With long-resounding cries they urge the train
To fit the ships, and launch into the main.
They toil, they sweat, thick clouds of dust arise,
The doubling clamours echo to the skies.
E'en then the Greeks had left the hostile plain,
And fate decreed the fall of Troy in vain;
But Jove's imperial queen their flight survey'd,
And sighing thus bespoke the blue-eyed maid:

"Shall then the Grecians fly! O dire disgrace!
And leave unpunish'd this perfidious race?
Shall Troy, shall Priam, and the adulterous spouse,
In peace enjoy the fruits of broken vows?
And bravest chiefs, in Helen's quarrel slain,
Lie unrevenged on yon detested plain?
No: let my Greeks, unmoved by vain alarms,
Once more refulgent shine in brazen arms.
Haste, goddess, haste! the flying host detain,
Nor let one sail be hoisted on the main."

Pallas obeys, and from Olympus' height
Swift to the ships precipitates her flight.
Ulysses, first in public cares, she found,
For prudent counsel like the gods renown'd:
Oppress'd with generous grief the hero stood,
Nor drew his sable vessels to the flood.
"And is it thus, divine Laertes' son,
Thus fly the Greeks (the martial maid begun),
Thus to their country bear their own disgrace,
And fame eternal leave to Priam's race?
Shall beauteous Helen still remain unfreed,
Still unrevenged, a thousand heroes bleed!
Haste, generous Ithacus! prevent the shame,
Recall your armies, and your chiefs reclaim.
Your own resistless eloquence employ,
And to the immortals trust the fall of Troy."

The voice divine confess'd the warlike maid,
Ulysses heard, nor uninspired obey'd:
Then meeting first Atrides, from his hand
Received the imperial sceptre of command.
Thus graced, attention and respect to gain,
He runs, he flies through all the Grecian train;
Each prince of name, or chief in arms approved,
He fired with praise, or with persuasion moved.

"Warriors like you, with strength and wisdom bless'd,
By brave examples should confirm the rest.
The monarch's will not yet reveal'd appears;
He tries our courage, but resents our fears.
The unwary Greeks his fury may provoke;
Not thus the king in secret council spoke.
Jove loves our chief, from Jove his honour springs,
Beware! for dreadful is the wrath of kings."

But if a clamorous vile plebeian rose,
Him with reproof he check'd or tamed with blows.
"Be still, thou slave, and to thy betters yield;
Unknown alike in council and in field!
Ye gods, what dastards would our host command!
Swept to the war, the lumber of a land.
Be silent, wretch, and think not here allow'd
That worst of tyrants, an usurping crowd.
To one sole monarch Jove commits the sway;
His are the laws, and him let all obey."(86)

With words like these the troops Ulysses ruled,
The loudest silenced, and the fiercest cool'd.
Back to the assembly roll the thronging train,
Desert the ships, and pour upon the plain.
Murmuring they move, as when old ocean roars,
And heaves huge surges to the trembling shores;
The groaning banks are burst with bellowing sound,
The rocks remurmur and the deeps rebound.
At length the tumult sinks, the noises cease,
And a still silence lulls the camp to peace.
Thersites only clamour'd in the throng,
Loquacious, loud, and turbulent of tongue:
Awed by no shame, by no respect controll'd,
In scandal busy, in reproaches bold:
With witty malice studious to defame,
Scorn all his joy, and laughter all his aim:--
But chief he gloried with licentious style
To lash the great, and monarchs to revile.
His figure such as might his soul proclaim;
One eye was blinking, and one leg was lame:
His mountain shoulders half his breast o'erspread,
Thin hairs bestrew'd his long misshapen head.
Spleen to mankind his envious heart possess'd,
And much he hated all, but most the best:
Ulysses or Achilles still his theme;
But royal scandal his delight supreme,
Long had he lived the scorn of every Greek,
Vex'd when he spoke, yet still they heard him speak.
Sharp was his voice; which in the shrillest tone,
Thus with injurious taunts attack'd the throne.

"Amidst the glories of so bright a reign,
What moves the great Atrides to complain?
'Tis thine whate'er the warrior's breast inflames,
The golden spoil, and thine the lovely dames.
With all the wealth our wars and blood bestow,
Thy tents are crowded and thy chests o'erflow.
Thus at full ease in heaps of riches roll'd,
What grieves the monarch? Is it thirst of gold?
Say, shall we march with our unconquer'd powers
(The Greeks and I) to Ilion's hostile towers,
And bring the race of royal bastards here,
For Troy to ransom at a price too dear?
But safer plunder thy own host supplies;
Say, wouldst thou seize some valiant leader's prize?
Or, if thy heart to generous love be led,
Some captive fair, to bless thy kingly bed?
Whate'er our master craves submit we must,
Plagued with his pride, or punish'd for his lust.
Oh women of Achaia; men no more!
Hence let us fly, and let him waste his store
In loves and pleasures on the Phrygian shore.
We may be wanted on some busy day,
When Hector comes: so great Achilles may:
From him he forced the prize we jointly gave,
From him, the fierce, the fearless, and the brave:
And durst he, as he ought, resent that wrong,
This mighty tyrant were no tyrant long."

Fierce from his seat at this Ulysses springs,(87)
In generous vengeance of the king of kings.
With indignation sparkling in his eyes,
He views the wretch, and sternly thus replies:

"Peace, factious monster, born to vex the state,
With wrangling talents form'd for foul debate:
Curb that impetuous tongue, nor rashly vain,
And singly mad, asperse the sovereign reign.
Have we not known thee, slave! of all our host,
The man who acts the least, upbraids the most?
Think not the Greeks to shameful flight to bring,
Nor let those lips profane the name of king.
For our return we trust the heavenly powers;
Be that their care; to fight like men be ours.
But grant the host with wealth the general load,
Except detraction, what hast thou bestow'd?
Suppose some hero should his spoils resign,
Art thou that hero, could those spoils be thine?
Gods! let me perish on this hateful shore,
And let these eyes behold my son no more;
If, on thy next offence, this hand forbear
To strip those arms thou ill deserv'st to wear,
Expel the council where our princes meet,
And send thee scourged and howling through the fleet."

He said, and cowering as the dastard bends,
The weighty sceptre on his bank descends.(88)
On the round bunch the bloody tumours rise:
The tears spring starting from his haggard eyes;
Trembling he sat, and shrunk in abject fears,
From his vile visage wiped the scalding tears;
While to his neighbour each express'd his thought:

"Ye gods! what wonders has Ulysses wrought!
What fruits his conduct and his courage yield!
Great in the council, glorious in the field.
Generous he rises in the crown's defence,
To curb the factious tongue of insolence,
Such just examples on offenders shown,
Sedition silence, and assert the throne."

'Twas thus the general voice the hero praised,
Who, rising, high the imperial sceptre raised:
The blue-eyed Pallas, his celestial friend,
(In form a herald,) bade the crowds attend.
The expecting crowds in still attention hung,
To hear the wisdom of his heavenly tongue.
Then deeply thoughtful, pausing ere he spoke,
His silence thus the prudent hero broke:

"Unhappy monarch! whom the Grecian race
With shame deserting, heap with vile disgrace.
Not such at Argos was their generous vow:
Once all their voice, but ah! forgotten now:
Ne'er to return, was then the common cry,
Till Troy's proud structures should in ashes lie.
Behold them weeping for their native shore;
What could their wives or helpless children more?
What heart but melts to leave the tender train,
And, one short month, endure the wintry main?
Few leagues removed, we wish our peaceful seat,
When the ship tosses, and the tempests beat:
Then well may this long stay provoke their tears,
The tedious length of nine revolving years.
Not for their grief the Grecian host I blame;
But vanquish'd! baffled! oh, eternal shame!
Expect the time to Troy's destruction given.
And try the faith of Chalcas and of heaven.
What pass'd at Aulis, Greece can witness bear,(89)
And all who live to breathe this Phrygian air.
Beside a fountain's sacred brink we raised
Our verdant altars, and the victims blazed:
'Twas where the plane-tree spread its shades around,
The altars heaved; and from the crumbling ground
A mighty dragon shot, of dire portent;
From Jove himself the dreadful sign was sent.
Straight to the tree his sanguine spires he roll'd,
And curl'd around in many a winding fold;
The topmost branch a mother-bird possess'd;
Eight callow infants fill'd the mossy nest;
Herself the ninth; the serpent, as he hung,
Stretch'd his black jaws and crush'd the crying young;
While hovering near, with miserable moan,
The drooping mother wail'd her children gone.
The mother last, as round the nest she flew,
Seized by the beating wing, the monster slew;
Nor long survived: to marble turn'd, he stands
A lasting prodigy on Aulis' sands.
Such was the will of Jove; and hence we dare
Trust in his omen, and support the war.
For while around we gazed with wondering eyes,
And trembling sought the powers with sacrifice,
Full of his god, the reverend Chalcas cried,(90)
'Ye Grecian warriors! lay your fears aside.
This wondrous signal Jove himself displays,
Of long, long labours, but eternal praise.
As many birds as by the snake were slain,
So many years the toils of Greece remain;
But wait the tenth, for Ilion's fall decreed:'
Thus spoke the prophet, thus the Fates succeed.
Obey, ye Grecians! with submission wait,
Nor let your flight avert the Trojan fate."
He said: the shores with loud applauses sound,
The hollow ships each deafening shout rebound.
Then Nestor thus--"These vain debates forbear,
Ye talk like children, not like heroes dare.
Where now are all your high resolves at last?
Your leagues concluded, your engagements past?
Vow'd with libations and with victims then,
Now vanish'd like their smoke: the faith of men!
While useless words consume the unactive hours,
No wonder Troy so long resists our powers.
Rise, great Atrides! and with courage sway;
We march to war, if thou direct the way.
But leave the few that dare resist thy laws,
The mean deserters of the Grecian cause,
To grudge the conquests mighty Jove prepares,
And view with envy our successful wars.
On that great day, when first the martial train,
Big with the fate of Ilion, plough'd the main,
Jove, on the right, a prosperous signal sent,
And thunder rolling shook the firmament.
Encouraged hence, maintain the glorious strife,
Till every soldier grasp a Phrygian wife,
Till Helen's woes at full revenged appear,
And Troy's proud matrons render tear for tear.
Before that day, if any Greek invite
His country's troops to base, inglorious flight,
Stand forth that Greek! and hoist his sail to fly,
And die the dastard first, who dreads to die.
But now, O monarch! all thy chiefs advise:(91)
Nor what they offer, thou thyself despise.
Among those counsels, let not mine be vain;
In tribes and nations to divide thy train:
His separate troops let every leader call,
Each strengthen each, and all encourage all.
What chief, or soldier, of the numerous band,
Or bravely fights, or ill obeys command,
When thus distinct they war, shall soon be known
And what the cause of Ilion not o'erthrown;
If fate resists, or if our arms are slow,
If gods above prevent, or men below."

To him the king: "How much thy years excel
In arts of counsel, and in speaking well!
O would the gods, in love to Greece, decree
But ten such sages as they grant in thee;
Such wisdom soon should Priam's force destroy,
And soon should fall the haughty towers of Troy!
But Jove forbids, who plunges those he hates
In fierce contention and in vain debates:
Now great Achilles from our aid withdraws,
By me provoked; a captive maid the cause:
If e'er as friends we join, the Trojan wall
Must shake, and heavy will the vengeance fall!
But now, ye warriors, take a short repast;
And, well refresh'd, to bloody conflict haste.
His sharpen'd spear let every Grecian wield,
And every Grecian fix his brazen shield,
Let all excite the fiery steeds of war,
And all for combat fit the rattling car.
This day, this dreadful day, let each contend;
No rest, no respite, till the shades descend;
Till darkness, or till death, shall cover all:
Let the war bleed, and let the mighty fall;
Till bathed in sweat be every manly breast,
With the huge shield each brawny arm depress'd,
Each aching nerve refuse the lance to throw,
And each spent courser at the chariot blow.
Who dares, inglorious, in his ships to stay,
Who dares to tremble on this signal day;
That wretch, too mean to fall by martial power,
The birds shall mangle, and the dogs devour."

The monarch spoke; and straight a murmur rose,
Loud as the surges when the tempest blows,
That dash'd on broken rocks tumultuous roar,
And foam and thunder on the stony shore.
Straight to the tents the troops dispersing bend,
The fires are kindled, and the smokes ascend;
With hasty feasts they sacrifice, and pray,
To avert the dangers of the doubtful day.
A steer of five years' age, large limb'd, and fed,(92)
To Jove's high altars Agamemnon led:
There bade the noblest of the Grecian peers;
And Nestor first, as most advanced in years.
Next came Idomeneus,(93)
and Tydeus' son,(94)
Ajax the less, and Ajax Telamon;(95)
Then wise Ulysses in his rank was placed;
And Menelaus came, unbid, the last.(96)
The chiefs surround the destined beast, and take
The sacred offering of the salted cake:
When thus the king prefers his solemn prayer;
"O thou! whose thunder rends the clouded air,
Who in the heaven of heavens hast fixed thy throne,
Supreme of gods! unbounded, and alone!
Hear! and before the burning sun descends,
Before the night her gloomy veil extends,
Low in the dust be laid yon hostile spires,
Be Priam's palace sunk in Grecian fires.
In Hector's breast be plunged this shining sword,
And slaughter'd heroes groan around their lord!"

Thus prayed the chief: his unavailing prayer
Great Jove refused, and toss'd in empty air:
The God averse, while yet the fumes arose,
Prepared new toils, and doubled woes on woes.
Their prayers perform'd the chiefs the rite pursue,
The barley sprinkled, and the victim slew.
The limbs they sever from the inclosing hide,
The thighs, selected to the gods, divide.
On these, in double cauls involved with art,
The choicest morsels lie from every part,
From the cleft wood the crackling flames aspire
While the fat victims feed the sacred fire.
The thighs thus sacrificed, and entrails dress'd
The assistants part, transfix, and roast the rest;
Then spread the tables, the repast prepare,
Each takes his seat, and each receives his share.
Soon as the rage of hunger was suppress'd,
The generous Nestor thus the prince address'd.

"Now bid thy heralds sound the loud alarms,
And call the squadrons sheathed in brazen arms;
Now seize the occasion, now the troops survey,
And lead to war when heaven directs the way."

He said; the monarch issued his commands;
Straight the loud heralds call the gathering bands
The chiefs inclose their king; the hosts divide,
In tribes and nations rank'd on either side.
High in the midst the blue-eyed virgin flies;
From rank to rank she darts her ardent eyes;
The dreadful aegis, Jove's immortal shield,
Blazed on her arm, and lighten'd all the field:
Round the vast orb a hundred serpents roll'd,
Form'd the bright fringe, and seem'd to burn in gold,
With this each Grecian's manly breast she warms,
Swells their bold hearts, and strings their nervous arms,
No more they sigh, inglorious, to return,
But breathe revenge, and for the combat burn.

As on some mountain, through the lofty grove,
The crackling flames ascend, and blaze above;
The fires expanding, as the winds arise,
Shoot their long beams, and kindle half the skies:
So from the polish'd arms, and brazen shields,
A gleamy splendour flash'd along the fields.
Not less their number than the embodied cranes,
Or milk-white swans in Asius' watery plains.
That, o'er the windings of Cayster's springs,(97)
Stretch their long necks, and clap their rustling wings,
Now tower aloft, and course in airy rounds,
Now light with noise; with noise the field resounds.
Thus numerous and confused, extending wide,
The legions crowd Scamander's flowery side;(98)
With rushing troops the plains are cover'd o'er,
And thundering footsteps shake the sounding shore.
Along the river's level meads they stand,
Thick as in spring the flowers adorn the land,
Or leaves the trees; or thick as insects play,
The wandering nation of a summer's day:
That, drawn by milky steams, at evening hours,
In gather'd swarms surround the rural bowers;
From pail to pail with busy murmur run
The gilded legions, glittering in the sun.
So throng'd, so close, the Grecian squadrons stood
In radiant arms, and thirst for Trojan blood.
Each leader now his scatter'd force conjoins
In close array, and forms the deepening lines.
Not with more ease the skilful shepherd-swain
Collects his flocks from thousands on the plain.
The king of kings, majestically tall,
Towers o'er his armies, and outshines them all;
Like some proud bull, that round the pastures leads
His subject herds, the monarch of the meads,
Great as the gods, the exalted chief was seen,
His strength like Neptune, and like Mars his mien;(99)
Jove o'er his eyes celestial glories spread,
And dawning conquest played around his head.

Say, virgins, seated round the throne divine,
All-knowing goddesses! immortal nine!(100)
Since earth's wide regions, heaven's umneasur'd height,
And hell's abyss, hide nothing from your sight,
(We, wretched mortals! lost in doubts below,
But guess by rumour, and but boast we know,)
O say what heroes, fired by thirst of fame,
Or urged by wrongs, to Troy's destruction came.
To count them all, demands a thousand tongues,
A throat of brass, and adamantine lungs.
Daughters of Jove, assist! inspired by you
The mighty labour dauntless I pursue;
What crowded armies, from what climes they bring,
Their names, their numbers, and their chiefs I sing.

                               NEPTUNE.


The hardy warriors whom Boeotia bred,
Penelius, Leitus, Prothoenor, led:
With these Arcesilaus and Clonius stand,
Equal in arms, and equal in command.
These head the troops that rocky Aulis yields,
And Eteon's hills, and Hyrie's watery fields,
And Schoenos, Scholos, Graea near the main,
And Mycalessia's ample piny plain;
Those who in Peteon or Ilesion dwell,
Or Harma where Apollo's prophet fell;
Heleon and Hyle, which the springs o'erflow;
And Medeon lofty, and Ocalea low;
Or in the meads of Haliartus stray,
Or Thespia sacred to the god of day:
Onchestus, Neptune's celebrated groves;
Copae, and Thisbe, famed for silver doves;
For flocks Erythrae, Glissa for the vine;
Platea green, and Nysa the divine;
And they whom Thebe's well-built walls inclose,
Where Myde, Eutresis, Corone, rose;
And Arne rich, with purple harvests crown'd;
And Anthedon, Boeotia's utmost bound.
Full fifty ships they send, and each conveys
Twice sixty warriors through the foaming seas.(102)

To these succeed Aspledon's martial train,
Who plough the spacious Orchomenian plain.
Two valiant brothers rule the undaunted throng,
Ialmen and Ascalaphus the strong:
Sons of Astyoche, the heavenly fair,
Whose virgin charms subdued the god of war:
(In Actor's court as she retired to rest,
The strength of Mars the blushing maid compress'd)
Their troops in thirty sable vessels sweep,
With equal oars, the hoarse-resounding deep.

The Phocians next in forty barks repair;
Epistrophus and Schedius head the war:
From those rich regions where Cephisus leads
His silver current through the flowery meads;
From Panopea, Chrysa the divine,
Where Anemoria's stately turrets shine,
Where Pytho, Daulis, Cyparissus stood,
And fair Lilaea views the rising flood.
These, ranged in order on the floating tide,
Close, on the left, the bold Boeotians' side.

Fierce Ajax led the Locrian squadrons on,
Ajax the less, Oileus' valiant son;
Skill'd to direct the flying dart aright;
Swift in pursuit, and active in the fight.
Him, as their chief, the chosen troops attend,
Which Bessa, Thronus, and rich Cynos send;
Opus, Calliarus, and Scarphe's bands;
And those who dwell where pleasing Augia stands,
And where Boagrius floats the lowly lands,
Or in fair Tarphe's sylvan seats reside:
In forty vessels cut the yielding tide.

Euboea next her martial sons prepares,
And sends the brave Abantes to the wars:
Breathing revenge, in arms they take their way
From Chalcis' walls, and strong Eretria;
The Isteian fields for generous vines renown'd,
The fair Caristos, and the Styrian ground;
Where Dios from her towers o'erlooks the plain,
And high Cerinthus views the neighbouring main.
Down their broad shoulders falls a length of hair;
Their hands dismiss not the long lance in air;
But with protended spears in fighting fields
Pierce the tough corslets and the brazen shields.
Twice twenty ships transport the warlike bands,
Which bold Elphenor, fierce in arms, commands.

Full fifty more from Athens stem the main,
Led by Menestheus through the liquid plain.
(Athens the fair, where great Erectheus sway'd,
That owed his nurture to the blue-eyed maid,
But from the teeming furrow took his birth,
The mighty offspring of the foodful earth.
Him Pallas placed amidst her wealthy fane,
Adored with sacrifice and oxen slain;
Where, as the years revolve, her altars blaze,
And all the tribes resound the goddess' praise.)
No chief like thee, Menestheus! Greece could yield,
To marshal armies in the dusty field,
The extended wings of battle to display,
Or close the embodied host in firm array.
Nestor alone, improved by length of days,
For martial conduct bore an equal praise.

With these appear the Salaminian bands,
Whom the gigantic Telamon commands;
In twelve black ships to Troy they steer their course,
And with the great Athenians join their force.

Next move to war the generous Argive train,
From high Troezene, and Maseta's plain,
And fair Ćgina circled by the main:
Whom strong Tyrinthe's lofty walls surround,
And Epidaure with viny harvests crown'd:
And where fair Asinen and Hermoin show
Their cliffs above, and ample bay below.
These by the brave Euryalus were led,
Great Sthenelus, and greater Diomed;
But chief Tydides bore the sovereign sway:
In fourscore barks they plough the watery way.

The proud Mycene arms her martial powers,
Cleone, Corinth, with imperial towers,(103)
Fair Araethyrea, Ornia's fruitful plain,
And Ćgion, and Adrastus' ancient reign;
And those who dwell along the sandy shore,
And where Pellene yields her fleecy store,
Where Helice and Hyperesia lie,
And Gonoessa's spires salute the sky.
Great Agamemnon rules the numerous band,
A hundred vessels in long order stand,
And crowded nations wait his dread command.
High on the deck the king of men appears,
And his refulgent arms in triumph wears;
Proud of his host, unrivall'd in his reign,
In silent pomp he moves along the main.

His brother follows, and to vengeance warms
The hardy Spartans, exercised in arms:
Phares and Brysia's valiant troops, and those
Whom Lacedaemon's lofty hills inclose;
Or Messe's towers for silver doves renown'd,
Amyclae, Laas, Augia's happy ground,
And those whom OEtylos' low walls contain,
And Helos, on the margin of the main:
These, o'er the bending ocean, Helen's cause,
In sixty ships with Menelaus draws:
Eager and loud from man to man he flies,
Revenge and fury flaming in his eyes;
While vainly fond, in fancy oft he hears
The fair one's grief, and sees her falling tears.

In ninety sail, from Pylos' sandy coast,
Nestor the sage conducts his chosen host:
From Amphigenia's ever-fruitful land,
Where Ćpy high, and little Pteleon stand;
Where beauteous Arene her structures shows,
And Thryon's walls Alpheus' streams inclose:
And Dorion, famed for Thamyris' disgrace,
Superior once of all the tuneful race,
Till, vain of mortals' empty praise, he strove
To match the seed of cloud-compelling Jove!
Too daring bard! whose unsuccessful pride
The immortal Muses in their art defied.
The avenging Muses of the light of day
Deprived his eyes, and snatch'd his voice away;
No more his heavenly voice was heard to sing,
His hand no more awaked the silver string.

Where under high Cyllene, crown'd with wood,
The shaded tomb of old Ćpytus stood;
From Ripe, Stratie, Tegea's bordering towns,
The Phenean fields, and Orchomenian downs,
Where the fat herds in plenteous pasture rove;
And Stymphelus with her surrounding grove;
Parrhasia, on her snowy cliffs reclined,
And high Enispe shook by wintry wind,
And fair Mantinea's ever-pleasing site;
In sixty sail the Arcadian bands unite.
Bold Agapenor, glorious at their head,
(Ancaeus' son) the mighty squadron led.
Their ships, supplied by Agamemnon's care,
Through roaring seas the wondering warriors bear;
The first to battle on the appointed plain,
But new to all the dangers of the main.

Those, where fair Elis and Buprasium join;
Whom Hyrmin, here, and Myrsinus confine,
And bounded there, where o'er the valleys rose
The Olenian rock; and where Alisium flows;
Beneath four chiefs (a numerous army) came:
The strength and glory of the Epean name.
In separate squadrons these their train divide,
Each leads ten vessels through the yielding tide.
One was Amphimachus, and Thalpius one;
(Eurytus' this, and that Teatus' son;)
Diores sprung from Amarynceus' line;
And great Polyxenus, of force divine.

But those who view fair Elis o'er the seas
From the blest islands of the Echinades,
In forty vessels under Meges move,
Begot by Phyleus, the beloved of Jove:
To strong Dulichium from his sire he fled,
And thence to Troy his hardy warriors led.

Ulysses follow'd through the watery road,
A chief, in wisdom equal to a god.
With those whom Cephalenia's line inclosed,
Or till their fields along the coast opposed;
Or where fair Ithaca o'erlooks the floods,
Where high Neritos shakes his waving woods,
Where Ćgilipa's rugged sides are seen,
Crocylia rocky, and Zacynthus green.
These in twelve galleys with vermilion prores,
Beneath his conduct sought the Phrygian shores.

Thoas came next, Andraemon's valiant son,
From Pleuron's walls, and chalky Calydon,
And rough Pylene, and the Olenian steep,
And Chalcis, beaten by the rolling deep.
He led the warriors from the Ćtolian shore,
For now the sons of OEneus were no more!
The glories of the mighty race were fled!
OEneus himself, and Meleager dead!
To Thoas' care now trust the martial train,
His forty vessels follow through the main.

Next, eighty barks the Cretan king commands,
Of Gnossus, Lyctus, and Gortyna's bands;
And those who dwell where Rhytion's domes arise,
Or white Lycastus glitters to the skies,
Or where by Phaestus silver Jardan runs;
Crete's hundred cities pour forth all her sons.
These march'd, Idomeneus, beneath thy care,
And Merion, dreadful as the god of war.

Tlepolemus, the sun of Hercules,
Led nine swift vessels through the foamy seas,
From Rhodes, with everlasting sunshine bright,
Jalyssus, Lindus, and Camirus white.
His captive mother fierce Alcides bore
From Ephyr's walls and Selle's winding shore,
Where mighty towns in ruins spread the plain,
And saw their blooming warriors early slain.
The hero, when to manly years he grew,
Alcides' uncle, old Licymnius, slew;
For this, constrain'd to quit his native place,
And shun the vengeance of the Herculean race,
A fleet he built, and with a numerous train
Of willing exiles wander'd o'er the main;
Where, many seas and many sufferings past,
On happy Rhodes the chief arrived at last:
There in three tribes divides his native band,
And rules them peaceful in a foreign land;
Increased and prosper'd in their new abodes
By mighty Jove, the sire of men and gods;
With joy they saw the growing empire rise,
And showers of wealth descending from the skies.

Three ships with Nireus sought the Trojan shore,
Nireus, whom Aglae to Charopus bore,
Nireus, in faultless shape and blooming grace,
The loveliest youth of all the Grecian race;(104)
Pelides only match'd his early charms;
But few his troops, and small his strength in arms.

Next thirty galleys cleave the liquid plain,
Of those Calydnae's sea-girt isles contain;
With them the youth of Nisyrus repair,
Casus the strong, and Crapathus the fair;
Cos, where Eurypylus possess'd the sway,
Till great Alcides made the realms obey:
These Antiphus and bold Phidippus bring,
Sprung from the god by Thessalus the king.

Now, Muse, recount Pelasgic Argos' powers,
From Alos, Alope, and Trechin's towers:
From Phthia's spacious vales; and Hella, bless'd
With female beauty far beyond the rest.
Full fifty ships beneath Achilles' care,
The Achaians, Myrmidons, Hellenians bear;
Thessalians all, though various in their name;
The same their nation, and their chief the same.
But now inglorious, stretch'd along the shore,
They hear the brazen voice of war no more;
No more the foe they face in dire array:
Close in his fleet the angry leader lay;
Since fair Briseis from his arms was torn,
The noblest spoil from sack'd Lyrnessus borne,
Then, when the chief the Theban walls o'erthrew,
And the bold sons of great Evenus slew.
There mourn'd Achilles, plunged in depth of care,
But soon to rise in slaughter, blood, and war.

To these the youth of Phylace succeed,
Itona, famous for her fleecy breed,
And grassy Pteleon deck'd with cheerful greens,
The bowers of Ceres, and the sylvan scenes.
Sweet Pyrrhasus, with blooming flowerets crown'd,
And Antron's watery dens, and cavern'd ground.
These own'd, as chief, Protesilas the brave,
Who now lay silent in the gloomy grave:
The first who boldly touch'd the Trojan shore,
And dyed a Phrygian lance with Grecian gore;
There lies, far distant from his native plain;
Unfinish'd his proud palaces remain,
And his sad consort beats her breast in vain.
His troops in forty ships Podarces led,
Iphiclus' son, and brother to the dead;
Nor he unworthy to command the host;
Yet still they mourn'd their ancient leader lost.

The men who Glaphyra's fair soil partake,
Where hills incircle Boebe's lowly lake,
Where Phaere hears the neighbouring waters fall,
Or proud Iolcus lifts her airy wall,
In ten black ships embark'd for Ilion's shore,
With bold Eumelus, whom Alceste bore:
All Pelias' race Alceste far outshined,
The grace and glory of the beauteous kind,

The troops Methone or Thaumacia yields,
Olizon's rocks, or Meliboea's fields,
With Philoctetes sail'd whose matchless art
From the tough bow directs the feather'd dart.
Seven were his ships; each vessel fifty row,
Skill'd in his science of the dart and bow.
But he lay raging on the Lemnian ground,
A poisonous hydra gave the burning wound;
There groan'd the chief in agonizing pain,
Whom Greece at length shall wish, nor wish in vain.
His forces Medon led from Lemnos' shore,
Oileus' son, whom beauteous Rhena bore.

The OEchalian race, in those high towers contain'd
Where once Eurytus in proud triumph reign'd,
Or where her humbler turrets Tricca rears,
Or where Ithome, rough with rocks, appears,
In thirty sail the sparkling waves divide,
Which Podalirius and Machaon guide.
To these his skill their parent-god imparts,
Divine professors of the healing arts.

The bold Ormenian and Asterian bands
In forty barks Eurypylus commands.
Where Titan hides his hoary head in snow,
And where Hyperia's silver fountains flow.
Thy troops, Argissa, Polypoetes leads,
And Eleon, shelter'd by Olympus' shades,
Gyrtone's warriors; and where Orthe lies,
And Oloosson's chalky cliffs arise.
Sprung from Pirithous of immortal race,
The fruit of fair Hippodame's embrace,
(That day, when hurl'd from Pelion's cloudy head,
To distant dens the shaggy Centaurs fled)
With Polypoetes join'd in equal sway
Leonteus leads, and forty ships obey.

In twenty sail the bold Perrhaebians came
From Cyphus, Guneus was their leader's name.
With these the Enians join'd, and those who freeze
Where cold Dodona lifts her holy trees;
Or where the pleasing Titaresius glides,
And into Peneus rolls his easy tides;
Yet o'er the silvery surface pure they flow,
The sacred stream unmix'd with streams below,
Sacred and awful! from the dark abodes
Styx pours them forth, the dreadful oath of gods!

Last, under Prothous the Magnesians stood,
(Prothous the swift, of old Tenthredon's blood;)
Who dwell where Pelion, crown'd with piny boughs,
Obscures the glade, and nods his shaggy brows;
Or where through flowery Tempe Peneus stray'd:
(The region stretch'd beneath his mighty shade:)
In forty sable barks they stemm'd the main;
Such were the chiefs, and such the Grecian train.

Say next, O Muse! of all Achaia breeds,
Who bravest fought, or rein'd the noblest steeds?
Eumelus' mares were foremost in the chase,
As eagles fleet, and of Pheretian race;
Bred where Pieria's fruitful fountains flow,
And train'd by him who bears the silver bow.
Fierce in the fight their nostrils breathed a flame,
Their height, their colour, and their age the same;
O'er fields of death they whirl the rapid car,
And break the ranks, and thunder through the war.
Ajax in arms the first renown acquired,
While stern Achilles in his wrath retired:
(His was the strength that mortal might exceeds,
And his the unrivall'd race of heavenly steeds:)
But Thetis' son now shines in arms no more;
His troops, neglected on the sandy shore.
In empty air their sportive javelins throw,
Or whirl the disk, or bend an idle bow:
Unstain'd with blood his cover'd chariots stand;
The immortal coursers graze along the strand;
But the brave chiefs the inglorious life deplored,
And, wandering o'er the camp, required their lord.

Now, like a deluge, covering all around,
The shining armies sweep along the ground;
Swift as a flood of fire, when storms arise,
Floats the wild field, and blazes to the skies.
Earth groan'd beneath them; as when angry Jove
Hurls down the forky lightning from above,
On Arime when he the thunder throws,
And fires Typhoeus with redoubled blows,
Where Typhon, press'd beneath the burning load,
Still feels the fury of the avenging god.

But various Iris, Jove's commands to bear,
Speeds on the wings of winds through liquid air;
In Priam's porch the Trojan chiefs she found,
The old consulting, and the youths around.
Polites' shape, the monarch's son, she chose,
Who from Ćsetes' tomb observed the foes,(105)
High on the mound; from whence in prospect lay
The fields, the tents, the navy, and the bay.
In this dissembled form, she hastes to bring
The unwelcome message to the Phrygian king.

"Cease to consult, the time for action calls;
War, horrid war, approaches to your walls!
Assembled armies oft have I beheld;
But ne'er till now such numbers charged a field:
Thick as autumnal leaves or driving sand,
The moving squadrons blacken all the strand.
Thou, godlike Hector! all thy force employ,
Assemble all the united bands of Troy;
In just array let every leader call
The foreign troops: this day demands them all!"

The voice divine the mighty chief alarms;
The council breaks, the warriors rush to arms.
The gates unfolding pour forth all their train,
Nations on nations fill the dusky plain,
Men, steeds, and chariots, shake the trembling ground:
The tumult thickens, and the skies resound.

Amidst the plain, in sight of Ilion, stands
A rising mount, the work of human hands;
(This for Myrinne's tomb the immortals know,
Though call'd Bateia in the world below;)
Beneath their chiefs in martial order here,
The auxiliar troops and Trojan hosts appear.

The godlike Hector, high above the rest,
Shakes his huge spear, and nods his plumy crest:
In throngs around his native bands repair,
And groves of lances glitter in the air.

Divine Ćneas brings the Dardan race,
Anchises' son, by Venus' stolen embrace,
Born in the shades of Ida's secret grove;
(A mortal mixing with the queen of love;)
Archilochus and Acamas divide
The warrior's toils, and combat by his side.

Who fair Zeleia's wealthy valleys till,(106)
Fast by the foot of Ida's sacred hill,
Or drink, Ćsepus, of thy sable flood,
Were led by Pandarus, of royal blood;
To whom his art Apollo deign'd to show,
Graced with the presents of his shafts and bow.

From rich Apaesus and Adrestia's towers,
High Teree's summits, and Pityea's bowers;
From these the congregated troops obey
Young Amphius and Adrastus' equal sway;
Old Merops' sons; whom, skill'd in fates to come,
The sire forewarn'd, and prophesied their doom:
Fate urged them on! the sire forewarn'd in vain,
They rush'd to war, and perish'd on the plain.

From Practius' stream, Percote's pasture lands,
And Sestos and Abydos' neighbouring strands,
From great Arisba's walls and Selle's coast,
Asius Hyrtacides conducts his host:
High on his car he shakes the flowing reins,
His fiery coursers thunder o'er the plains.

The fierce Pelasgi next, in war renown'd,
March from Larissa's ever-fertile ground:
In equal arms their brother leaders shine,
Hippothous bold, and Pyleus the divine.

Next Acamas and Pyrous lead their hosts,
In dread array, from Thracia's wintry coasts;
Round the bleak realms where Hellespontus roars,
And Boreas beats the hoarse-resounding shores.

With great Euphemus the Ciconians move,
Sprung from Troezenian Ceus, loved by Jove.

Pyraechmes the Paeonian troops attend,
Skill'd in the fight their crooked bows to bend;
From Axius' ample bed he leads them on,
Axius, that laves the distant Amydon,
Axius, that swells with all his neighbouring rills,
And wide around the floating region fills.

The Paphlagonians Pylaemenes rules,
Where rich Henetia breeds her savage mules,
Where Erythinus' rising cliffs are seen,
Thy groves of box, Cytorus! ever green,
And where Ćgialus and Cromna lie,
And lofty Sesamus invades the sky,
And where Parthenius, roll'd through banks of flowers,
Reflects her bordering palaces and bowers.

Here march'd in arms the Halizonian band,
Whom Odius and Epistrophus command,
From those far regions where the sun refines
The ripening silver in Alybean mines.

There mighty Chromis led the Mysian train,
And augur Ennomus, inspired in vain;
For stern Achilles lopp'd his sacred head,
Roll'd down Scamander with the vulgar dead.

Phorcys and brave Ascanius here unite
The Ascanian Phrygians, eager for the fight.

Of those who round Maeonia's realms reside,
Or whom the vales in shades of Tmolus hide,
Mestles and Antiphus the charge partake,
Born on the banks of Gyges' silent lake.
There, from the fields where wild Maeander flows,
High Mycale, and Latmos' shady brows,
And proud Miletus, came the Carian throngs,
With mingled clamours and with barbarous tongues.(107)
Amphimachus and Naustes guide the train,
Naustes the bold, Amphimachus the vain,
Who, trick'd with gold, and glittering on his car,
Rode like a woman to the field of war.
Fool that he was! by fierce Achilles slain,
The river swept him to the briny main:
There whelm'd with waves the gaudy warrior lies
The valiant victor seized the golden prize.

The forces last in fair array succeed,
Which blameless Glaucus and Sarpedon lead
The warlike bands that distant Lycia yields,
Where gulfy Xanthus foams along the fields.





BOOK III.


ARGUMENT.

THE DUEL OF MENELAUS AND PARIS.

The armies being ready to engage, a single combat is agreed upon between
Menelaus and Paris (by the intervention of Hector) for the determination
of the war. Iris is sent to call Helen to behold the fight. She leads her
to the walls of Troy, where Priam sat with his counsellers observing the
Grecian leaders on the plain below, to whom Helen gives an account of the
chief of them. The kings on either part take the solemn oath for the
conditions of the combat. The duel ensues; wherein Paris being overcome,
he is snatched away in a cloud by Venus, and transported to his apartment.
She then calls Helen from the walls, and brings the lovers together.
Agamemnon, on the part of the Grecians, demands the restoration of Helen,
and the performance of the articles.

The three-and-twentieth day still continues throughout this book. The
scene is sometimes in the fields before Troy, and sometimes in Troy
itself.

Thus by their leaders' care each martial band
Moves into ranks, and stretches o'er the land.
With shouts the Trojans, rushing from afar,
Proclaim their motions, and provoke the war
So when inclement winters vex the plain
With piercing frosts, or thick-descending rain,
To warmer seas the cranes embodied fly,(108)
With noise, and order, through the midway sky;
To pigmy nations wounds and death they bring,
And all the war descends upon the wing,
But silent, breathing rage, resolved and skill'd(109)
By mutual aids to fix a doubtful field,
Swift march the Greeks: the rapid dust around
Darkening arises from the labour'd ground.
Thus from his flaggy wings when Notus sheds
A night of vapours round the mountain heads,
Swift-gliding mists the dusky fields invade,
To thieves more grateful than the midnight shade;
While scarce the swains their feeding flocks survey,
Lost and confused amidst the thicken'd day:
So wrapp'd in gathering dust, the Grecian train,
A moving cloud, swept on, and hid the plain.

Now front to front the hostile armies stand,
Eager of fight, and only wait command;
When, to the van, before the sons of fame
Whom Troy sent forth, the beauteous Paris came:
In form a god! the panther's speckled hide
Flow'd o'er his armour with an easy pride:
His bended bow across his shoulders flung,
His sword beside him negligently hung;
Two pointed spears he shook with gallant grace,
And dared the bravest of the Grecian race.

As thus, with glorious air and proud disdain,
He boldly stalk'd, the foremost on the plain,
Him Menelaus, loved of Mars, espies,
With heart elated, and with joyful eyes:
So joys a lion, if the branching deer,
Or mountain goat, his bulky prize, appear;
Eager he seizes and devours the slain,
Press'd by bold youths and baying dogs in vain.
Thus fond of vengeance, with a furious bound,
In clanging arms he leaps upon the ground
From his high chariot: him, approaching near,
The beauteous champion views with marks of fear,
Smit with a conscious sense, retires behind,
And shuns the fate he well deserved to find.
As when some shepherd, from the rustling trees(110)
Shot forth to view, a scaly serpent sees,
Trembling and pale, he starts with wild affright
And all confused precipitates his flight:
So from the king the shining warrior flies,
And plunged amid the thickest Trojans lies.

As godlike Hector sees the prince retreat,
He thus upbraids him with a generous heat:
"Unhappy Paris! but to women brave!(111)
So fairly form'd, and only to deceive!
Oh, hadst thou died when first thou saw'st the light,
Or died at least before thy nuptial rite!
A better fate than vainly thus to boast,
And fly, the scandal of thy Trojan host.
Gods! how the scornful Greeks exult to see
Their fears of danger undeceived in thee!
Thy figure promised with a martial air,
But ill thy soul supplies a form so fair.
In former days, in all thy gallant pride,
When thy tall ships triumphant stemm'd the tide,
When Greece beheld thy painted canvas flow,
And crowds stood wondering at the passing show,
Say, was it thus, with such a baffled mien,
You met the approaches of the Spartan queen,
Thus from her realm convey'd the beauteous prize,
And both her warlike lords outshined in Helen's eyes?
This deed, thy foes' delight, thy own disgrace,
Thy father's grief, and ruin of thy race;
This deed recalls thee to the proffer'd fight;
Or hast thou injured whom thou dar'st not right?
Soon to thy cost the field would make thee know
Thou keep'st the consort of a braver foe.
Thy graceful form instilling soft desire,
Thy curling tresses, and thy silver lyre,
Beauty and youth; in vain to these you trust,
When youth and beauty shall be laid in dust:
Troy yet may wake, and one avenging blow
Crush the dire author of his country's woe."

His silence here, with blushes, Paris breaks:
"'Tis just, my brother, what your anger speaks:
But who like thee can boast a soul sedate,
So firmly proof to all the shocks of fate?
Thy force, like steel, a temper'd hardness shows,
Still edged to wound, and still untired with blows,
Like steel, uplifted by some strenuous swain,
With falling woods to strew the wasted plain.
Thy gifts I praise; nor thou despise the charms
With which a lover golden Venus arms;
Soft moving speech, and pleasing outward show,
No wish can gain them, but the gods bestow.
Yet, would'st thou have the proffer'd combat stand,
The Greeks and Trojans seat on either hand;
Then let a midway space our hosts divide,
And, on that stage of war, the cause be tried:
By Paris there the Spartan king be fought,
For beauteous Helen and the wealth she brought;
And who his rival can in arms subdue,
His be the fair, and his the treasure too.
Thus with a lasting league your toils may cease,
And Troy possess her fertile fields in peace;
Thus may the Greeks review their native shore,
Much famed for generous steeds, for beauty more."

He said. The challenge Hector heard with joy,
Then with his spear restrain'd the youth of Troy,
Held by the midst, athwart; and near the foe
Advanced with steps majestically slow:
While round his dauntless head the Grecians pour
Their stones and arrows in a mingled shower.

Then thus the monarch, great Atrides, cried:
"Forbear, ye warriors! lay the darts aside:
A parley Hector asks, a message bears;
We know him by the various plume he wears."
Awed by his high command the Greeks attend,
The tumult silence, and the fight suspend.

While from the centre Hector rolls his eyes
On either host, and thus to both applies:
"Hear, all ye Trojan, all ye Grecian bands,
What Paris, author of the war, demands.
Your shining swords within the sheath restrain,
And pitch your lances in the yielding plain.
Here in the midst, in either army's sight,
He dares the Spartan king to single fight;
And wills that Helen and the ravish'd spoil,
That caused the contest, shall reward the toil.
Let these the brave triumphant victor grace,
And different nations part in leagues of peace."

He spoke: in still suspense on either side
Each army stood: the Spartan chief replied:

"Me too, ye warriors, hear, whose fatal right
A world engages in the toils of fight.
To me the labour of the field resign;
Me Paris injured; all the war be mine.
Fall he that must, beneath his rival's arms;
And live the rest, secure of future harms.
Two lambs, devoted by your country's rite,
To earth a sable, to the sun a white,
Prepare, ye Trojans! while a third we bring
Select to Jove, the inviolable king.
Let reverend Priam in the truce engage,
And add the sanction of considerate age;
His sons are faithless, headlong in debate,
And youth itself an empty wavering state;
Cool age advances, venerably wise,
Turns on all hands its deep-discerning eyes;
Sees what befell, and what may yet befall,
Concludes from both, and best provides for all.

The nations hear with rising hopes possess'd,
And peaceful prospects dawn in every breast.
Within the lines they drew their steeds around,
And from their chariots issued on the ground;
Next, all unbuckling the rich mail they wore,
Laid their bright arms along the sable shore.
On either side the meeting hosts are seen
With lances fix'd, and close the space between.
Two heralds now, despatch'd to Troy, invite
The Phrygian monarch to the peaceful rite.

Talthybius hastens to the fleet, to bring
The lamb for Jove, the inviolable king.

Meantime to beauteous Helen, from the skies
The various goddess of the rainbow flies:
(Like fair Laodice in form and face,
The loveliest nymph of Priam's royal race:)
Her in the palace, at her loom she found;
The golden web her own sad story crown'd,
The Trojan wars she weaved (herself the prize)
And the dire triumphs of her fatal eyes.
To whom the goddess of the painted bow:
"Approach, and view the wondrous scene below!(112)
Each hardy Greek, and valiant Trojan knight,
So dreadful late, and furious for the fight,
Now rest their spears, or lean upon their shields;
Ceased is the war, and silent all the fields.
Paris alone and Sparta's king advance,
In single fight to toss the beamy lance;
Each met in arms, the fate of combat tries,
Thy love the motive, and thy charms the prize."

This said, the many-coloured maid inspires
Her husband's love, and wakes her former fires;
Her country, parents, all that once were dear,
Rush to her thought, and force a tender tear,
O'er her fair face a snowy veil she threw,
And, softly sighing, from the loom withdrew.
Her handmaids, Clymene and Ćthra, wait
Her silent footsteps to the Scaean gate.

There sat the seniors of the Trojan race:
(Old Priam's chiefs, and most in Priam's grace,)
The king the first; Thymoetes at his side;
Lampus and Clytius, long in council tried;
Panthus, and Hicetaon, once the strong;
And next, the wisest of the reverend throng,
Antenor grave, and sage Ucalegon,
Lean'd on the walls and bask'd before the sun:
Chiefs, who no more in bloody fights engage,
But wise through time, and narrative with age,
In summer days, like grasshoppers rejoice,
A bloodless race, that send a feeble voice.
These, when the Spartan queen approach'd the tower,
In secret own'd resistless beauty's power:
They cried, "No wonder such celestial charms(113)
For nine long years have set the world in arms;
What winning graces! what majestic mien!
She moves a goddess, and she looks a queen!
Yet hence, O Heaven, convey that fatal face,
And from destruction save the Trojan race."

The good old Priam welcomed her, and cried,
"Approach, my child, and grace thy father's side.
See on the plain thy Grecian spouse appears,
The friends and kindred of thy former years.
No crime of thine our present sufferings draws,
Not thou, but Heaven's disposing will, the cause
The gods these armies and this force employ,
The hostile gods conspire the fate of Troy.
But lift thy eyes, and say, what Greek is he
(Far as from hence these aged orbs can see)
Around whose brow such martial graces shine,
So tall, so awful, and almost divine!
Though some of larger stature tread the green,
None match his grandeur and exalted mien:
He seems a monarch, and his country's pride."
Thus ceased the king, and thus the fair replied:

"Before thy presence, father, I appear,
With conscious shame and reverential fear.
Ah! had I died, ere to these walk I fled,
False to my country, and my nuptial bed;
My brothers, friends, and daughter left behind,
False to them all, to Paris only kind!
For this I mourn, till grief or dire disease
Shall waste the form whose fault it was to please!
The king of kings, Atrides, you survey,
Great in the war, and great in arts of sway:
My brother once, before my days of shame!
And oh! that still he bore a brother's name!"

With wonder Priam view'd the godlike man,
Extoll'd the happy prince, and thus began:
"O bless'd Atrides! born to prosperous fate,
Successful monarch of a mighty state!
How vast thy empire! Of your matchless train
What numbers lost, what numbers yet remain!
In Phrygia once were gallant armies known,
In ancient time, when Otreus fill'd the throne,
When godlike Mygdon led their troops of horse,
And I, to join them, raised the Trojan force:
Against the manlike Amazons we stood,(114)
And Sangar's stream ran purple with their blood.
But far inferior those, in martial grace,
And strength of numbers, to this Grecian race."

This said, once more he view'd the warrior train;
"What's he, whose arms lie scatter'd on the plain?
Broad is his breast, his shoulders larger spread,
Though great Atrides overtops his head.
Nor yet appear his care and conduct small;
From rank to rank he moves, and orders all.
The stately ram thus measures o'er the ground,
And, master of the flock, surveys them round."

Then Helen thus: "Whom your discerning eyes
Have singled out, is Ithacus the wise;
A barren island boasts his glorious birth;
His fame for wisdom fills the spacious earth."

Antenor took the word, and thus began:(115)
"Myself, O king! have seen that wondrous man
When, trusting Jove and hospitable laws,
To Troy he came, to plead the Grecian cause;
(Great Menelaus urged the same request;)
My house was honour'd with each royal guest:
I knew their persons, and admired their parts,
Both brave in arms, and both approved in arts.
Erect, the Spartan most engaged our view;
Ulysses seated, greater reverence drew.
When Atreus' son harangued the listening train,
Just was his sense, and his expression plain,
His words succinct, yet full, without a fault;
He spoke no more than just the thing he ought.
But when Ulysses rose, in thought profound,(116)
His modest eyes he fix'd upon the ground;
As one unskill'd or dumb, he seem'd to stand,
Nor raised his head, nor stretch'd his sceptred hand;
But, when he speaks, what elocution flows!
Soft as the fleeces of descending snows,(117)
The copious accents fall, with easy art;
Melting they fall, and sink into the heart!
Wondering we hear, and fix'd in deep surprise,
Our ears refute the censure of our eyes."

The king then ask'd (as yet the camp he view'd)
"What chief is that, with giant strength endued,
Whose brawny shoulders, and whose swelling chest,
And lofty stature, far exceed the rest?
"Ajax the great, (the beauteous queen replied,)
Himself a host: the Grecian strength and pride.
See! bold Idomeneus superior towers
Amid yon circle of his Cretan powers,
Great as a god! I saw him once before,
With Menelaus on the Spartan shore.
The rest I know, and could in order name;
All valiant chiefs, and men of mighty fame.
Yet two are wanting of the numerous train,
Whom long my eyes have sought, but sought in vain:
Castor and Pollux, first in martial force,
One bold on foot, and one renown'd for horse.
My brothers these; the same our native shore,
One house contain'd us, as one mother bore.
Perhaps the chiefs, from warlike toils at ease,
For distant Troy refused to sail the seas;
Perhaps their swords some nobler quarrel draws,
Ashamed to combat in their sister's cause."

So spoke the fair, nor knew her brothers' doom;(118)
Wrapt in the cold embraces of the tomb;
Adorn'd with honours in their native shore,
Silent they slept, and heard of wars no more.

Meantime the heralds, through the crowded town.
Bring the rich wine and destined victims down.
Idaeus' arms the golden goblets press'd,(119)
Who thus the venerable king address'd:
"Arise, O father of the Trojan state!
The nations call, thy joyful people wait
To seal the truce, and end the dire debate.
Paris, thy son, and Sparta's king advance,
In measured lists to toss the weighty lance;
And who his rival shall in arms subdue,
His be the dame, and his the treasure too.
Thus with a lasting league our toils may cease,
And Troy possess her fertile fields in peace:
So shall the Greeks review their native shore,
Much famed for generous steeds, for beauty more."

With grief he heard, and bade the chiefs prepare
To join his milk-white coursers to the car;
He mounts the seat, Antenor at his side;
The gentle steeds through Scaea's gates they guide:(120)
Next from the car descending on the plain,
Amid the Grecian host and Trojan train,
Slow they proceed: the sage Ulysses then
Arose, and with him rose the king of men.
On either side a sacred herald stands,
The wine they mix, and on each monarch's hands
Pour the full urn; then draws the Grecian lord
His cutlass sheathed beside his ponderous sword;
From the sign'd victims crops the curling hair;(121)
The heralds part it, and the princes share;
Then loudly thus before the attentive bands
He calls the gods, and spreads his lifted hands:

"O first and greatest power! whom all obey,
Who high on Ida's holy mountain sway,
Eternal Jove! and you bright orb that roll
From east to west, and view from pole to pole!
Thou mother Earth! and all ye living floods!
Infernal furies, and Tartarean gods,
Who rule the dead, and horrid woes prepare
For perjured kings, and all who falsely swear!
Hear, and be witness. If, by Paris slain,
Great Menelaus press the fatal plain;
The dame and treasures let the Trojan keep,
And Greece returning plough the watery deep.
If by my brother's lance the Trojan bleed,
Be his the wealth and beauteous dame decreed:
The appointed fine let Ilion justly pay,
And every age record the signal day.
This if the Phrygians shall refuse to yield,
Arms must revenge, and Mars decide the field."

With that the chief the tender victims slew,
And in the dust their bleeding bodies threw;
The vital spirit issued at the wound,
And left the members quivering on the ground.
From the same urn they drink the mingled wine,
And add libations to the powers divine.
While thus their prayers united mount the sky,
"Hear, mighty Jove! and hear, ye gods on high!
And may their blood, who first the league confound,
Shed like this wine, disdain the thirsty ground;
May all their consorts serve promiscuous lust,
And all their lust be scatter'd as the dust!"
Thus either host their imprecations join'd,
Which Jove refused, and mingled with the wind.

The rites now finish'd, reverend Priam rose,
And thus express'd a heart o'ercharged with woes:
"Ye Greeks and Trojans, let the chiefs engage,
But spare the weakness of my feeble age:
In yonder walls that object let me shun,
Nor view the danger of so dear a son.
Whose arms shall conquer and what prince shall fall,
Heaven only knows; for heaven disposes all."

This said, the hoary king no longer stay'd,
But on his car the slaughter'd victims laid:
Then seized the reins his gentle steeds to guide,
And drove to Troy, Antenor at his side.

Bold Hector and Ulysses now dispose
The lists of combat, and the ground inclose:
Next to decide, by sacred lots prepare,
Who first shall launch his pointed spear in air.
The people pray with elevated hands,
And words like these are heard through all the bands:
"Immortal Jove, high Heaven's superior lord,
On lofty Ida's holy mount adored!
Whoe'er involved us in this dire debate,
O give that author of the war to fate
And shades eternal! let division cease,
And joyful nations join in leagues of peace."

With eyes averted Hector hastes to turn
The lots of fight and shakes the brazen urn.
Then, Paris, thine leap'd forth; by fatal chance
Ordain'd the first to whirl the weighty lance.
Both armies sat the combat to survey.
Beside each chief his azure armour lay,
And round the lists the generous coursers neigh.
The beauteous warrior now arrays for fight,
In gilded arms magnificently bright:
The purple cuishes clasp his thighs around,
With flowers adorn'd, with silver buckles bound:
Lycaon's corslet his fair body dress'd,
Braced in and fitted to his softer breast;
A radiant baldric, o'er his shoulder tied,
Sustain'd the sword that glitter'd at his side:
His youthful face a polish'd helm o'erspread;
The waving horse-hair nodded on his head:
His figured shield, a shining orb, he takes,
And in his hand a pointed javelin shakes.
With equal speed and fired by equal charms,
The Spartan hero sheathes his limbs in arms.

Now round the lists the admiring armies stand,
With javelins fix'd, the Greek and Trojan band.
Amidst the dreadful vale, the chiefs advance,
All pale with rage, and shake the threatening lance.
The Trojan first his shining javelin threw;
Full on Atrides' ringing shield it flew,
Nor pierced the brazen orb, but with a bound(122)
Leap'd from the buckler, blunted, on the ground.
Atrides then his massy lance prepares,
In act to throw, but first prefers his prayers:

"Give me, great Jove! to punish lawless lust,
And lay the Trojan gasping in the dust:
Destroy the aggressor, aid my righteous cause,
Avenge the breach of hospitable laws!
Let this example future times reclaim,
And guard from wrong fair friendship's holy name."
Be said, and poised in air the javelin sent,
Through Paris' shield the forceful weapon went,
His corslet pierces, and his garment rends,
And glancing downward, near his flank descends.
The wary Trojan, bending from the blow,
Eludes the death, and disappoints his foe:
But fierce Atrides waved his sword, and strook
Full on his casque: the crested helmet shook;
The brittle steel, unfaithful to his hand,
Broke short: the fragments glitter'd on the sand.
The raging warrior to the spacious skies
Raised his upbraiding voice and angry eyes:
"Then is it vain in Jove himself to trust?
And is it thus the gods assist the just?
When crimes provoke us, Heaven success denies;
The dart falls harmless, and the falchion flies."
Furious he said, and towards the Grecian crew
(Seized by the crest) the unhappy warrior drew;
Struggling he followed, while the embroider'd thong
That tied his helmet, dragg'd the chief along.
Then had his ruin crown'd Atrides' joy,
But Venus trembled for the prince of Troy:
Unseen she came, and burst the golden band;
And left an empty helmet in his hand.
The casque, enraged, amidst the Greeks he threw;
The Greeks with smiles the polish'd trophy view.
Then, as once more he lifts the deadly dart,
In thirst of vengeance, at his rival's heart;
The queen of love her favour'd champion shrouds
(For gods can all things) in a veil of clouds.
Raised from the field the panting youth she led,
And gently laid him on the bridal bed,
With pleasing sweets his fainting sense renews,
And all the dome perfumes with heavenly dews.
Meantime the brightest of the female kind,
The matchless Helen, o'er the walls reclined;
To her, beset with Trojan beauties, came,
In borrow'd form, the laughter-loving dame.
(She seem'd an ancient maid, well-skill'd to cull
The snowy fleece, and wind the twisted wool.)
The goddess softly shook her silken vest,
That shed perfumes, and whispering thus address'd:

[Illustration: VENUS, DISGUISED, INVITING HELEN TO THE CHAMBER OF PARIS.]

      VENUS, DISGUISED, INVITING HELEN TO THE CHAMBER OF PARIS.


"Haste, happy nymph! for thee thy Paris calls,
Safe from the fight, in yonder lofty walls,
Fair as a god; with odours round him spread,
He lies, and waits thee on the well-known bed;
Not like a warrior parted from the foe,
But some gay dancer in the public show."

She spoke, and Helen's secret soul was moved;
She scorn'd the champion, but the man she loved.
Fair Venus' neck, her eyes that sparkled fire,
And breast, reveal'd the queen of soft desire.(123)
Struck with her presence, straight the lively red
Forsook her cheek; and trembling, thus she said:
"Then is it still thy pleasure to deceive?
And woman's frailty always to believe!
Say, to new nations must I cross the main,
Or carry wars to some soft Asian plain?
For whom must Helen break her second vow?
What other Paris is thy darling now?
Left to Atrides, (victor in the strife,)
An odious conquest and a captive wife,
Hence let me sail; and if thy Paris bear
My absence ill, let Venus ease his care.
A handmaid goddess at his side to wait,
Renounce the glories of thy heavenly state,
Be fix'd for ever to the Trojan shore,
His spouse, or slave; and mount the skies no more.
For me, to lawless love no longer led,
I scorn the coward, and detest his bed;
Else should I merit everlasting shame,
And keen reproach, from every Phrygian dame:
Ill suits it now the joys of love to know,
Too deep my anguish, and too wild my woe."

           [Illustration: VENUS PRESENTING HELEN TO PARIS.]

                   VENUS PRESENTING HELEN TO PARIS.


Then thus incensed, the Paphian queen replies:
"Obey the power from whom thy glories rise:
Should Venus leave thee, every charm must fly,
Fade from thy cheek, and languish in thy eye.
Cease to provoke me, lest I make thee more
The world's aversion, than their love before;
Now the bright prize for which mankind engage,
Than, the sad victim, of the public rage."

At this, the fairest of her sex obey'd,
And veil'd her blushes in a silken shade;
Unseen, and silent, from the train she moves,
Led by the goddess of the Smiles and Loves.
Arrived, and enter'd at the palace gate,
The maids officious round their mistress wait;
Then, all dispersing, various tasks attend;
The queen and goddess to the prince ascend.
Full in her Paris' sight, the queen of love
Had placed the beauteous progeny of Jove;
Where, as he view'd her charms, she turn'd away
Her glowing eyes, and thus began to say:

"Is this the chief, who, lost to sense of shame,
Late fled the field, and yet survives his fame?
O hadst thou died beneath the righteous sword
Of that brave man whom once I call'd my lord!
The boaster Paris oft desired the day
With Sparta's king to meet in single fray:
Go now, once more thy rival's rage excite,
Provoke Atrides, and renew the fight:
Yet Helen bids thee stay, lest thou unskill'd
Shouldst fall an easy conquest on the field."

The prince replies: "Ah cease, divinely fair,
Nor add reproaches to the wounds I bear;
This day the foe prevail'd by Pallas' power:
We yet may vanquish in a happier hour:
There want not gods to favour us above;
But let the business of our life be love:
These softer moments let delights employ,
And kind embraces snatch the hasty joy.
Not thus I loved thee, when from Sparta's shore
My forced, my willing heavenly prize I bore,
When first entranced in Cranae's isle I lay,(124)
Mix'd with thy soul, and all dissolved away!"
Thus having spoke, the enamour'd Phrygian boy
Rush'd to the bed, impatient for the joy.
Him Helen follow'd slow with bashful charms,
And clasp'd the blooming hero in her arms.

While these to love's delicious rapture yield,
The stern Atrides rages round the field:
So some fell lion whom the woods obey,
Roars through the desert, and demands his prey.
Paris he seeks, impatient to destroy,
But seeks in vain along the troops of Troy;
Even those had yielded to a foe so brave
The recreant warrior, hateful as the grave.
Then speaking thus, the king of kings arose,
"Ye Trojans, Dardans, all our generous foes!
Hear and attest! from Heaven with conquest crown'd,
Our brother's arms the just success have found:
Be therefore now the Spartan wealth restor'd,
Let Argive Helen own her lawful lord;
The appointed fine let Ilion justly pay,
And age to age record this signal day."

He ceased; his army's loud applauses rise,
And the long shout runs echoing through the skies.

                        [Illustration: VENUS.]

                                VENUS.

BOOK IV.


ARGUMENT.

THE BREACH OF THE TRUCE, AND THE FIRST BATTLE.

The gods deliberate in council concerning the Trojan war: they agree upon
the continuation of it, and Jupiter sends down Minerva to break the truce.
She persuades Pandarus to aim an arrow at Menelaus, who is wounded, but
cured by Machaon. In the meantime some of the Trojan troops attack the
Greeks. Agamemnon is distinguished in all the parts of a good general; he
reviews the troops, and exhorts the leaders, some by praises and others by
reproof. Nestor is particularly celebrated for his military discipline.
The battle joins, and great numbers are slain on both sides.

The same day continues through this as through the last book (as it does
also through the two following, and almost to the end of the seventh
book). The scene is wholly in the field before Troy.

And now Olympus' shining gates unfold;
The gods, with Jove, assume their thrones of gold:
Immortal Hebe, fresh with bloom divine,
The golden goblet crowns with purple wine:
While the full bowls flow round, the powers employ
Their careful eyes on long-contended Troy.

When Jove, disposed to tempt Saturnia's spleen,
Thus waked the fury of his partial queen,
"Two powers divine the son of Atreus aid,
Imperial Juno, and the martial maid;(125)
But high in heaven they sit, and gaze from far,
The tame spectators of his deeds of war.
Not thus fair Venus helps her favour'd knight,
The queen of pleasures shares the toils of fight,
Each danger wards, and constant in her care,
Saves in the moment of the last despair.
Her act has rescued Paris' forfeit life,
Though great Atrides gain'd the glorious strife.
Then say, ye powers! what signal issue waits
To crown this deed, and finish all the fates!
Shall Heaven by peace the bleeding kingdoms spare,
Or rouse the furies, and awake the war?
Yet, would the gods for human good provide,
Atrides soon might gain his beauteous bride,
Still Priam's walls in peaceful honours grow,
And through his gates the crowding nations flow."

Thus while he spoke, the queen of heaven, enraged,
And queen of war, in close consult engaged:
Apart they sit, their deep designs employ,
And meditate the future woes of Troy.
Though secret anger swell'd Minerva's breast,
The prudent goddess yet her wrath suppress'd;
But Juno, impotent of passion, broke
Her sullen silence, and with fury spoke:

               [Illustration: THE COUNCIL OF THE GODS.]

                       THE COUNCIL OF THE GODS.


"Shall then, O tyrant of the ethereal reign!
My schemes, my labours, and my hopes be vain?
Have I, for this, shook Ilion with alarms,
Assembled nations, set two worlds in arms?
To spread the war, I flew from shore to shore;
The immortal coursers scarce the labour bore.
At length ripe vengeance o'er their heads impends,
But Jove himself the faithless race defends.
Loth as thou art to punish lawless lust,
Not all the gods are partial and unjust."

The sire whose thunder shakes the cloudy skies,
Sighs from his inmost soul, and thus replies:
"Oh lasting rancour! oh insatiate hate
To Phrygia's monarch, and the Phrygian state!
What high offence has fired the wife of Jove?
Can wretched mortals harm the powers above,
That Troy, and Troy's whole race thou wouldst confound,
And yon fair structures level with the ground!
Haste, leave the skies, fulfil thy stern desire,
Burst all her gates, and wrap her walls in fire!
Let Priam bleed! if yet you thirst for more,
Bleed all his sons, and Ilion float with gore:
To boundless vengeance the wide realm be given,
Till vast destruction glut the queen of heaven!
So let it be, and Jove his peace enjoy,(126)
When heaven no longer hears the name of Troy.
But should this arm prepare to wreak our hate
On thy loved realms, whose guilt demands their fate;
Presume not thou the lifted bolt to stay,
Remember Troy, and give the vengeance way.
For know, of all the numerous towns that rise
Beneath the rolling sun and starry skies,
Which gods have raised, or earth-born men enjoy,
None stands so dear to Jove as sacred Troy.
No mortals merit more distinguish'd grace
Than godlike Priam, or than Priam's race.
Still to our name their hecatombs expire,
And altars blaze with unextinguish'd fire."

At this the goddess rolled her radiant eyes,
Then on the Thunderer fix'd them, and replies:
"Three towns are Juno's on the Grecian plains,
More dear than all the extended earth contains,
Mycenae, Argos, and the Spartan wall;(127)

These thou mayst raze, nor I forbid their fall:
'Tis not in me the vengeance to remove;
The crime's sufficient that they share my love.
Of power superior why should I complain?
Resent I may, but must resent in vain.
Yet some distinction Juno might require,
Sprung with thyself from one celestial sire,
A goddess born, to share the realms above,
And styled the consort of the thundering Jove;
Nor thou a wife and sister's right deny;(128)
Let both consent, and both by terms comply;
So shall the gods our joint decrees obey,
And heaven shall act as we direct the way.
See ready Pallas waits thy high commands
To raise in arms the Greek and Phrygian bands;
Their sudden friendship by her arts may cease,
And the proud Trojans first infringe the peace."

The sire of men and monarch of the sky
The advice approved, and bade Minerva fly,
Dissolve the league, and all her arts employ
To make the breach the faithless act of Troy.
Fired with the charge, she headlong urged her flight,
And shot like lightning from Olympus' height.
As the red comet, from Saturnius sent
To fright the nations with a dire portent,
(A fatal sign to armies on the plain,
Or trembling sailors on the wintry main,)
With sweeping glories glides along in air,
And shakes the sparkles from its blazing hair:(129)
Between both armies thus, in open sight
Shot the bright goddess in a trail of light,
With eyes erect the gazing hosts admire
The power descending, and the heavens on fire!
"The gods (they cried), the gods this signal sent,
And fate now labours with some vast event:
Jove seals the league, or bloodier scenes prepares;
Jove, the great arbiter of peace and wars."

They said, while Pallas through the Trojan throng,
(In shape a mortal,) pass'd disguised along.
Like bold Laodocus, her course she bent,
Who from Antenor traced his high descent.
Amidst the ranks Lycaon's son she found,
The warlike Pandarus, for strength renown'd;
Whose squadrons, led from black Ćsepus' flood,(130)
With flaming shields in martial circle stood.
To him the goddess: "Phrygian! canst thou hear
A well-timed counsel with a willing ear?
What praise were thine, couldst thou direct thy dart,
Amidst his triumph, to the Spartan's heart?
What gifts from Troy, from Paris wouldst thou gain,
Thy country's foe, the Grecian glory slain?
Then seize the occasion, dare the mighty deed,
Aim at his breast, and may that aim succeed!
But first, to speed the shaft, address thy vow
To Lycian Phoebus with the silver bow,
And swear the firstlings of thy flock to pay,
On Zelia's altars, to the god of day."(131)

He heard, and madly at the motion pleased,
His polish'd bow with hasty rashness seized.
'Twas form'd of horn, and smooth'd with artful toil:
A mountain goat resign'd the shining spoil.
Who pierced long since beneath his arrows bled;
The stately quarry on the cliffs lay dead,
And sixteen palms his brow's large honours spread:
The workmen join'd, and shaped the bended horns,
And beaten gold each taper point adorns.
This, by the Greeks unseen, the warrior bends,
Screen'd by the shields of his surrounding friends:
There meditates the mark; and couching low,
Fits the sharp arrow to the well-strung bow.
One from a hundred feather'd deaths he chose,
Fated to wound, and cause of future woes;
Then offers vows with hecatombs to crown
Apollo's altars in his native town.

Now with full force the yielding horn he bends,
Drawn to an arch, and joins the doubling ends;
Close to his breast he strains the nerve below,
Till the barb'd points approach the circling bow;
The impatient weapon whizzes on the wing;
Sounds the tough horn, and twangs the quivering string.

But thee, Atrides! in that dangerous hour
The gods forget not, nor thy guardian power,
Pallas assists, and (weakened in its force)
Diverts the weapon from its destined course:
So from her babe, when slumber seals his eye,
The watchful mother wafts the envenom'd fly.
Just where his belt with golden buckles join'd,
Where linen folds the double corslet lined,
She turn'd the shaft, which, hissing from above,
Pass'd the broad belt, and through the corslet drove;
The folds it pierced, the plaited linen tore,
And razed the skin, and drew the purple gore.
As when some stately trappings are decreed
To grace a monarch on his bounding steed,
A nymph in Caria or Maeonia bred,
Stains the pure ivory with a lively red;
With equal lustre various colours vie,
The shining whiteness, and the Tyrian dye:
So great Atrides! show'd thy sacred blood,
As down thy snowy thigh distill'd the streaming flood.
With horror seized, the king of men descried
The shaft infix'd, and saw the gushing tide:
Nor less the Spartan fear'd, before he found
The shining barb appear above the wound,
Then, with a sigh, that heaved his manly breast,
The royal brother thus his grief express'd,
And grasp'd his hand; while all the Greeks around
With answering sighs return'd the plaintive sound.

"Oh, dear as life! did I for this agree
The solemn truce, a fatal truce to thee!
Wert thou exposed to all the hostile train,
To fight for Greece, and conquer, to be slain!
The race of Trojans in thy ruin join,
And faith is scorn'd by all the perjured line.
Not thus our vows, confirm'd with wine and gore,
Those hands we plighted, and those oaths we swore,
Shall all be vain: when Heaven's revenge is slow,
Jove but prepares to strike the fiercer blow.
The day shall come, that great avenging day,
When Troy's proud glories in the dust shall lay,
When Priam's powers and Priam's self shall fall,
And one prodigious ruin swallow all.
I see the god, already, from the pole
Bare his red arm, and bid the thunder roll;
I see the Eternal all his fury shed,
And shake his aegis o'er their guilty head.
Such mighty woes on perjured princes wait;
But thou, alas! deserv'st a happier fate.
Still must I mourn the period of thy days,
And only mourn, without my share of praise?
Deprived of thee, the heartless Greeks no more
Shall dream of conquests on the hostile shore;
Troy seized of Helen, and our glory lost,
Thy bones shall moulder on a foreign coast;
While some proud Trojan thus insulting cries,
(And spurns the dust where Menelaus lies,)
'Such are the trophies Greece from Ilion brings,
And such the conquest of her king of kings!
Lo his proud vessels scatter'd o'er the main,
And unrevenged, his mighty brother slain.'
Oh! ere that dire disgrace shall blast my fame,
O'erwhelm me, earth! and hide a monarch's shame."

He said: a leader's and a brother's fears
Possess his soul, which thus the Spartan cheers:
"Let not thy words the warmth of Greece abate;
The feeble dart is guiltless of my fate:
Stiff with the rich embroider'd work around,
My varied belt repell'd the flying wound."

To whom the king: "My brother and my friend,
Thus, always thus, may Heaven thy life defend!
Now seek some skilful hand, whose powerful art
May stanch the effusion, and extract the dart.
Herald, be swift, and bid Machaon bring
His speedy succour to the Spartan king;
Pierced with a winged shaft (the deed of Troy),
The Grecian's sorrow, and the Dardan's joy."

With hasty zeal the swift Talthybius flies;
Through the thick files he darts his searching eyes,
And finds Machaon, where sublime he stands(132)
In arms incircled with his native bands.
Then thus: "Machaon, to the king repair,
His wounded brother claims thy timely care;
Pierced by some Lycian or Dardanian bow,
A grief to us, a triumph to the foe."

The heavy tidings grieved the godlike man
Swift to his succour through the ranks he ran.
The dauntless king yet standing firm he found,
And all the chiefs in deep concern around.
Where to the steely point the reed was join'd,
The shaft he drew, but left the head behind.
Straight the broad belt with gay embroidery graced,
He loosed; the corslet from his breast unbraced;
Then suck'd the blood, and sovereign balm infused,(133)
Which Chiron gave, and Ćsculapius used.

While round the prince the Greeks employ their care,
The Trojans rush tumultuous to the war;
Once more they glitter in refulgent arms,
Once more the fields are fill'd with dire alarms.
Nor had you seen the king of men appear
Confused, unactive, or surprised with fear;
But fond of glory, with severe delight,
His beating bosom claim'd the rising fight.
No longer with his warlike steeds he stay'd,
Or press'd the car with polish'd brass inlaid
But left Eurymedon the reins to guide;
The fiery coursers snorted at his side.
On foot through all the martial ranks he moves
And these encourages, and those reproves.
"Brave men!" he cries, (to such who boldly dare
Urge their swift steeds to face the coming war),
"Your ancient valour on the foes approve;
Jove is with Greece, and let us trust in Jove.
'Tis not for us, but guilty Troy, to dread,
Whose crimes sit heavy on her perjured head;
Her sons and matrons Greece shall lead in chains,
And her dead warriors strew the mournful plains."

Thus with new ardour he the brave inspires;
Or thus the fearful with reproaches fires:
"Shame to your country, scandal of your kind;
Born to the fate ye well deserve to find!
Why stand ye gazing round the dreadful plain,
Prepared for flight, but doom'd to fly in vain?
Confused and panting thus, the hunted deer
Falls as he flies, a victim to his fear.
Still must ye wait the foes, and still retire,
Till yon tall vessels blaze with Trojan fire?
Or trust ye, Jove a valiant foe shall chase,
To save a trembling, heartless, dastard race?"

This said, he stalk'd with ample strides along,
To Crete's brave monarch and his martial throng;
High at their head he saw the chief appear,
And bold Meriones excite the rear.
At this the king his generous joy express'd,
And clasp'd the warrior to his armed breast.
"Divine Idomeneus! what thanks we owe
To worth like thine! what praise shall we bestow?
To thee the foremost honours are decreed,
First in the fight and every graceful deed.
For this, in banquets, when the generous bowls
Restore our blood, and raise the warriors' souls,
Though all the rest with stated rules we bound,
Unmix'd, unmeasured, are thy goblets crown'd.
Be still thyself, in arms a mighty name;
Maintain thy honours, and enlarge thy fame."
To whom the Cretan thus his speech address'd:
"Secure of me, O king! exhort the rest.
Fix'd to thy side, in every toil I share,
Thy firm associate in the day of war.
But let the signal be this moment given;
To mix in fight is all I ask of Heaven.
The field shall prove how perjuries succeed,
And chains or death avenge the impious deed."

Charm'd with this heat, the king his course pursues,
And next the troops of either Ajax views:
In one firm orb the bands were ranged around,
A cloud of heroes blacken'd all the ground.
Thus from the lofty promontory's brow
A swain surveys the gathering storm below;
Slow from the main the heavy vapours rise,
Spread in dim streams, and sail along the skies,
Till black as night the swelling tempest shows,
The cloud condensing as the west-wind blows:
He dreads the impending storm, and drives his flock
To the close covert of an arching rock.

Such, and so thick, the embattled squadrons stood,
With spears erect, a moving iron wood:
A shady light was shot from glimmering shields,
And their brown arms obscured the dusky fields.

"O heroes! worthy such a dauntless train,
Whose godlike virtue we but urge in vain,
(Exclaim'd the king), who raise your eager bands
With great examples, more than loud commands.
Ah! would the gods but breathe in all the rest
Such souls as burn in your exalted breast,
Soon should our arms with just success be crown'd,
And Troy's proud walls lie smoking on the ground."

Then to the next the general bends his course;
(His heart exults, and glories in his force);
There reverend Nestor ranks his Pylian bands,
And with inspiring eloquence commands;
With strictest order sets his train in arms,
The chiefs advises, and the soldiers warms.
Alastor, Chromius, Haemon, round him wait,
Bias the good, and Pelagon the great.
The horse and chariots to the front assign'd,
The foot (the strength of war) he ranged behind;
The middle space suspected troops supply,
Inclosed by both, nor left the power to fly;
He gives command to "curb the fiery steed,
Nor cause confusion, nor the ranks exceed:
Before the rest let none too rashly ride;
No strength nor skill, but just in time, be tried:
The charge once made, no warrior turn the rein,
But fight, or fall; a firm embodied train.
He whom the fortune of the field shall cast
From forth his chariot, mount the next in haste;
Nor seek unpractised to direct the car,
Content with javelins to provoke the war.
Our great forefathers held this prudent course,
Thus ruled their ardour, thus preserved their force;
By laws like these immortal conquests made,
And earth's proud tyrants low in ashes laid."

So spoke the master of the martial art,
And touch'd with transport great Atrides' heart.
"Oh! hadst thou strength to match thy brave desires,
And nerves to second what thy soul inspires!
But wasting years, that wither human race,
Exhaust thy spirits, and thy arms unbrace.
What once thou wert, oh ever mightst thou be!
And age the lot of any chief but thee."

Thus to the experienced prince Atrides cried;
He shook his hoary locks, and thus replied:
"Well might I wish, could mortal wish renew(134)
That strength which once in boiling youth I knew;
Such as I was, when Ereuthalion, slain
Beneath this arm, fell prostrate on the plain.
But heaven its gifts not all at once bestows,
These years with wisdom crowns, with action those:
The field of combat fits the young and bold,
The solemn council best becomes the old:
To you the glorious conflict I resign,
Let sage advice, the palm of age, be mine."

He said. With joy the monarch march'd before,
And found Menestheus on the dusty shore,
With whom the firm Athenian phalanx stands;
And next Ulysses, with his subject bands.
Remote their forces lay, nor knew so far
The peace infringed, nor heard the sounds of war;
The tumult late begun, they stood intent
To watch the motion, dubious of the event.
The king, who saw their squadrons yet unmoved,
With hasty ardour thus the chiefs reproved:

"Can Peleus' son forget a warrior's part.
And fears Ulysses, skill'd in every art?
Why stand you distant, and the rest expect
To mix in combat which yourselves neglect?
From you 'twas hoped among the first to dare
The shock of armies, and commence the war;
For this your names are call'd before the rest,
To share the pleasures of the genial feast:
And can you, chiefs! without a blush survey
Whole troops before you labouring in the fray?
Say, is it thus those honours you requite?
The first in banquets, but the last in fight."

Ulysses heard: the hero's warmth o'erspread
His cheek with blushes: and severe, he said:
"Take back the unjust reproach! Behold we stand
Sheathed in bright arms, and but expect command.
If glorious deeds afford thy soul delight,
Behold me plunging in the thickest fight.
Then give thy warrior-chief a warrior's due,
Who dares to act whate'er thou dar'st to view."
Struck with his generous wrath, the king replies:

"O great in action, and in council wise!
With ours, thy care and ardour are the same,
Nor need I to commend, nor aught to blame.
Sage as thou art, and learn'd in human kind,
Forgive the transport of a martial mind.
Haste to the fight, secure of just amends;
The gods that make, shall keep the worthy, friends."

He said, and pass'd where great Tydides lay,
His steeds and chariots wedged in firm array;
(The warlike Sthenelus attends his side;)(135)
To whom with stern reproach the monarch cried:
"O son of Tydeus! (he, whose strength could tame
The bounding steed, in arms a mighty name)
Canst thou, remote, the mingling hosts descry,
With hands unactive, and a careless eye?
Not thus thy sire the fierce encounter fear'd;
Still first in front the matchless prince appear'd:
What glorious toils, what wonders they recite,
Who view'd him labouring through the ranks of fight?
I saw him once, when gathering martial powers,
A peaceful guest, he sought Mycenae's towers;
Armies he ask'd, and armies had been given,
Not we denied, but Jove forbade from heaven;
While dreadful comets glaring from afar,
Forewarn'd the horrors of the Theban war.(136)
Next, sent by Greece from where Asopus flows,
A fearless envoy, he approach'd the foes;
Thebes' hostile walls unguarded and alone,
Dauntless he enters, and demands the throne.
The tyrant feasting with his chiefs he found,
And dared to combat all those chiefs around:
Dared, and subdued before their haughty lord;
For Pallas strung his arm and edged his sword.
Stung with the shame, within the winding way,
To bar his passage fifty warriors lay;
Two heroes led the secret squadron on,
Mason the fierce, and hardy Lycophon;
Those fifty slaughter'd in the gloomy vale.
He spared but one to bear the dreadful tale,
Such Tydeus was, and such his martial fire;
Gods! how the son degenerates from the sire!"

No words the godlike Diomed return'd,
But heard respectful, and in secret burn'd:
Not so fierce Capaneus' undaunted son;
Stern as his sire, the boaster thus begun:

"What needs, O monarch! this invidious praise,
Ourselves to lessen, while our sire you raise?
Dare to be just, Atrides! and confess
Our value equal, though our fury less.
With fewer troops we storm'd the Theban wall,
And happier saw the sevenfold city fall,(137)
In impious acts the guilty father died;
The sons subdued, for Heaven was on their side.
Far more than heirs of all our parents' fame,
Our glories darken their diminish'd name."

To him Tydides thus: "My friend, forbear;
Suppress thy passion, and the king revere:
His high concern may well excuse this rage,
Whose cause we follow, and whose war we wage:
His the first praise, were Ilion's towers o'erthrown,
And, if we fail, the chief disgrace his own.
Let him the Greeks to hardy toils excite,
'Tis ours to labour in the glorious fight."

He spoke, and ardent, on the trembling ground
Sprung from his car: his ringing arms resound.
Dire was the clang, and dreadful from afar,
Of arm'd Tydides rushing to the war.
As when the winds, ascending by degrees,(138)
First move the whitening surface of the seas,
The billows float in order to the shore,
The wave behind rolls on the wave before;
Till, with the growing storm, the deeps arise,
Foam o'er the rocks, and thunder to the skies.
So to the fight the thick battalions throng,
Shields urged on shields, and men drove men along
Sedate and silent move the numerous bands;
No sound, no whisper, but the chief's commands,
Those only heard; with awe the rest obey,
As if some god had snatch'd their voice away.
Not so the Trojans; from their host ascends
A general shout that all the region rends.
As when the fleecy flocks unnumber'd stand
In wealthy folds, and wait the milker's hand,
The hollow vales incessant bleating fills,
The lambs reply from all the neighbouring hills:
Such clamours rose from various nations round,
Mix'd was the murmur, and confused the sound.
Each host now joins, and each a god inspires,
These Mars incites, and those Minerva fires,
Pale flight around, and dreadful terror reign;
And discord raging bathes the purple plain;
Discord! dire sister of the slaughtering power,
Small at her birth, but rising every hour,
While scarce the skies her horrid head can bound,
She stalks on earth, and shakes the world around;(139)
The nations bleed, where'er her steps she turns,
The groan still deepens, and the combat burns.

Now shield with shield, with helmet helmet closed,
To armour armour, lance to lance opposed,
Host against host with shadowy squadrons drew,
The sounding darts in iron tempests flew,
Victors and vanquish'd join'd promiscuous cries,
And shrilling shouts and dying groans arise;
With streaming blood the slippery fields are dyed,
And slaughter'd heroes swell the dreadful tide.

As torrents roll, increased by numerous rills,
With rage impetuous, down their echoing hills
Rush to the vales, and pour'd along the plain.
Roar through a thousand channels to the main:
The distant shepherd trembling hears the sound;
So mix both hosts, and so their cries rebound.

The bold Antilochus the slaughter led,
The first who struck a valiant Trojan dead:
At great Echepolus the lance arrives,
Razed his high crest, and through his helmet drives;
Warm'd in the brain the brazen weapon lies,
And shades eternal settle o'er his eyes.
So sinks a tower, that long assaults had stood
Of force and fire, its walls besmear'd with blood.
Him, the bold leader of the Abantian throng,(140)
Seized to despoil, and dragg'd the corpse along:
But while he strove to tug the inserted dart,
Agenor's javelin reach'd the hero's heart.
His flank, unguarded by his ample shield,
Admits the lance: he falls, and spurns the field;
The nerves, unbraced, support his limbs no more;
The soul comes floating in a tide of gore.
Trojans and Greeks now gather round the slain;
The war renews, the warriors bleed again:
As o'er their prey rapacious wolves engage,
Man dies on man, and all is blood and rage.

In blooming youth fair Simoisius fell,
Sent by great Ajax to the shades of hell;
Fair Simoisius, whom his mother bore
Amid the flocks on silver Simois' shore:
The nymph descending from the hills of Ide,
To seek her parents on his flowery side,
Brought forth the babe, their common care and joy,
And thence from Simois named the lovely boy.
Short was his date! by dreadful Ajax slain,
He falls, and renders all their cares in vain!
So falls a poplar, that in watery ground
Raised high the head, with stately branches crown'd,
(Fell'd by some artist with his shining steel,
To shape the circle of the bending wheel,)
Cut down it lies, tall, smooth, and largely spread,
With all its beauteous honours on its head
There, left a subject to the wind and rain,
And scorch'd by suns, it withers on the plain
Thus pierced by Ajax, Simoisius lies
Stretch'd on the shore, and thus neglected dies.

At Ajax, Antiphus his javelin threw;
The pointed lance with erring fury flew,
And Leucus, loved by wise Ulysses, slew.
He drops the corpse of Simoisius slain,
And sinks a breathless carcase on the plain.
This saw Ulysses, and with grief enraged,
Strode where the foremost of the foes engaged;
Arm'd with his spear, he meditates the wound,
In act to throw; but cautious look'd around,
Struck at his sight the Trojans backward drew,
And trembling heard the javelin as it flew.
A chief stood nigh, who from Abydos came,
Old Priam's son, Democoon was his name.
The weapon entered close above his ear,
Cold through his temples glides the whizzing spear;(141)
With piercing shrieks the youth resigns his breath,
His eye-balls darken with the shades of death;
Ponderous he falls; his clanging arms resound,
And his broad buckler rings against the ground.

Seized with affright the boldest foes appear;
E'en godlike Hector seems himself to fear;
Slow he gave way, the rest tumultuous fled;
The Greeks with shouts press on, and spoil the dead:
But Phoebus now from Ilion's towering height
Shines forth reveal'd, and animates the fight.
"Trojans, be bold, and force with force oppose;
Your foaming steeds urge headlong on the foes!
Nor are their bodies rocks, nor ribb'd with steel;
Your weapons enter, and your strokes they feel.
Have ye forgot what seem'd your dread before?
The great, the fierce Achilles fights no more."

Apollo thus from Ilion's lofty towers,
Array'd in terrors, roused the Trojan powers:
While war's fierce goddess fires the Grecian foe,
And shouts and thunders in the fields below.
Then great Diores fell, by doom divine,
In vain his valour and illustrious line.
A broken rock the force of Pyrus threw,
(Who from cold Ćnus led the Thracian crew,)(142)
Full on his ankle dropp'd the ponderous stone,
Burst the strong nerves, and crash'd the solid bone.
Supine he tumbles on the crimson sands,
Before his helpless friends, and native bands,
And spreads for aid his unavailing hands.
The foe rush'd furious as he pants for breath,
And through his navel drove the pointed death:
His gushing entrails smoked upon the ground,
And the warm life came issuing from the wound.

His lance bold Thoas at the conqueror sent,
Deep in his breast above the pap it went,
Amid the lungs was fix'd the winged wood,
And quivering in his heaving bosom stood:
Till from the dying chief, approaching near,
The Ćtolian warrior tugg'd his weighty spear:
Then sudden waved his flaming falchion round,
And gash'd his belly with a ghastly wound;
The corpse now breathless on the bloody plain,
To spoil his arms the victor strove in vain;
The Thracian bands against the victor press'd,
A grove of lances glitter'd at his breast.
Stern Thoas, glaring with revengeful eyes,
In sullen fury slowly quits the prize.

Thus fell two heroes; one the pride of Thrace,
And one the leader of the Epeian race;
Death's sable shade at once o'ercast their eyes,
In dust the vanquish'd and the victor lies.
With copious slaughter all the fields are red,
And heap'd with growing mountains of the dead.

Had some brave chief this martial scene beheld,
By Pallas guarded through the dreadful field;
Might darts be bid to turn their points away,
And swords around him innocently play;
The war's whole art with wonder had he seen,
And counted heroes where he counted men.

So fought each host, with thirst of glory fired,
And crowds on crowds triumphantly expired.

BOOK V.


ARGUMENT.

THE ACTS OF DIOMED.

Diomed, assisted by Pallas, performs wonders in this day's battle.
Pandarus wounds him with an arrow, but the goddess cures him, enables him
to discern gods from mortals, and prohibits him from contending with any
of the former, excepting Venus. Ćneas joins Pandarus to oppose him;
Pandarus is killed, and Ćneas in great danger but for the assistance of
Venus; who, as she is removing her son from the fight, is wounded on the
hand by Diomed. Apollo seconds her in his rescue, and at length carries
off Ćneas to Troy, where he is healed in the temple of Pergamus. Mars
rallies the Trojans, and assists Hector to make a stand. In the meantime
Ćneas is restored to the field, and they overthrow several of the Greeks;
among the rest Tlepolemus is slain by Sarpedon. Juno and Minerva descend
to resist Mars; the latter incites Diomed to go against that god; he
wounds him, and sends him groaning to heaven.

The first battle continues through this book. The scene is the same as in
the former.

But Pallas now Tydides' soul inspires,(143)
Fills with her force, and warms with all her fires,
Above the Greeks his deathless fame to raise,
And crown her hero with distinguish'd praise.
High on his helm celestial lightnings play,
His beamy shield emits a living ray;
The unwearied blaze incessant streams supplies,
Like the red star that fires the autumnal skies,
When fresh he rears his radiant orb to sight,
And, bathed in ocean, shoots a keener light.
Such glories Pallas on the chief bestow'd,
Such, from his arms, the fierce effulgence flow'd:
Onward she drives him, furious to engage,
Where the fight burns, and where the thickest rage.

The sons of Dares first the combat sought,
A wealthy priest, but rich without a fault;
In Vulcan's fane the father's days were led,
The sons to toils of glorious battle bred;
These singled from their troops the fight maintain,
These, from their steeds, Tydides on the plain.
Fierce for renown the brother-chiefs draw near,
And first bold Phegeus cast his sounding spear,
Which o'er the warrior's shoulder took its course,
And spent in empty air its erring force.
Not so, Tydides, flew thy lance in vain,
But pierced his breast, and stretch'd him on the plain.
Seized with unusual fear, Idaeus fled,
Left the rich chariot, and his brother dead.
And had not Vulcan lent celestial aid,
He too had sunk to death's eternal shade;
But in a smoky cloud the god of fire
Preserved the son, in pity to the sire.
The steeds and chariot, to the navy led,
Increased the spoils of gallant Diomed.

Struck with amaze and shame, the Trojan crew,
Or slain, or fled, the sons of Dares view;
When by the blood-stain'd hand Minerva press'd
The god of battles, and this speech address'd:

"Stern power of war! by whom the mighty fall,
Who bathe in blood, and shake the lofty wall!
Let the brave chiefs their glorious toils divide;
And whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide:
While we from interdicted fields retire,
Nor tempt the wrath of heaven's avenging sire."

Her words allay the impetuous warrior's heat,
The god of arms and martial maid retreat;
Removed from fight, on Xanthus' flowery bounds
They sat, and listen'd to the dying sounds.

Meantime, the Greeks the Trojan race pursue,
And some bold chieftain every leader slew:
First Odius falls, and bites the bloody sand,
His death ennobled by Atrides' hand:

As he to flight his wheeling car address'd,
The speedy javelin drove from back to breast.
In dust the mighty Halizonian lay,
His arms resound, the spirit wings its way.

Thy fate was next, O Phaestus! doom'd to feel
The great Idomeneus' protended steel;
Whom Borus sent (his son and only joy)
From fruitful Tarne to the fields of Troy.
The Cretan javelin reach'd him from afar,
And pierced his shoulder as he mounts his car;
Back from the car he tumbles to the ground,
And everlasting shades his eyes surround.

Then died Scamandrius, expert in the chase,
In woods and wilds to wound the savage race;
Diana taught him all her sylvan arts,
To bend the bow, and aim unerring darts:
But vainly here Diana's arts he tries,
The fatal lance arrests him as he flies;
From Menelaus' arm the weapon sent,
Through his broad back and heaving bosom went:
Down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound,
His brazen armour rings against the ground.

Next artful Phereclus untimely fell;
Bold Merion sent him to the realms of hell.
Thy father's skill, O Phereclus! was thine,
The graceful fabric and the fair design;
For loved by Pallas, Pallas did impart
To him the shipwright's and the builder's art.
Beneath his hand the fleet of Paris rose,
The fatal cause of all his country's woes;
But he, the mystic will of heaven unknown,
Nor saw his country's peril, nor his own.
The hapless artist, while confused he fled,
The spear of Merion mingled with the dead.
Through his right hip, with forceful fury cast,
Between the bladder and the bone it pass'd;
Prone on his knees he falls with fruitless cries,
And death in lasting slumber seals his eyes.

From Meges' force the swift Pedaeus fled,
Antenor's offspring from a foreign bed,
Whose generous spouse, Theanor, heavenly fair,
Nursed the young stranger with a mother's care.
How vain those cares! when Meges in the rear
Full in his nape infix'd the fatal spear;
Swift through his crackling jaws the weapon glides,
And the cold tongue and grinning teeth divides.

Then died Hypsenor, generous and divine,
Sprung from the brave Dolopion's mighty line,
Who near adored Scamander made abode,
Priest of the stream, and honoured as a god.
On him, amidst the flying numbers found,
Eurypylus inflicts a deadly wound;
On his broad shoulders fell the forceful brand,
Thence glancing downwards, lopp'd his holy hand,
Which stain'd with sacred blood the blushing sand.
Down sunk the priest: the purple hand of death
Closed his dim eye, and fate suppress'd his breath.

Thus toil'd the chiefs, in different parts engaged.
In every quarter fierce Tydides raged;
Amid the Greek, amid the Trojan train,
Rapt through the ranks he thunders o'er the plain;
Now here, now there, he darts from place to place,
Pours on the rear, or lightens in their face.
Thus from high hills the torrents swift and strong
Deluge whole fields, and sweep the trees along,
Through ruin'd moles the rushing wave resounds,
O'erwhelm's the bridge, and bursts the lofty bounds;
The yellow harvests of the ripen'd year,
And flatted vineyards, one sad waste appear!(144)
While Jove descends in sluicy sheets of rain,
And all the labours of mankind are vain.

So raged Tydides, boundless in his ire,
Drove armies back, and made all Troy retire.
With grief the leader of the Lycian band
Saw the wide waste of his destructive hand:
His bended bow against the chief he drew;
Swift to the mark the thirsty arrow flew,
Whose forky point the hollow breastplate tore,
Deep in his shoulder pierced, and drank the gore:
The rushing stream his brazen armour dyed,
While the proud archer thus exulting cried:

"Hither, ye Trojans, hither drive your steeds!
Lo! by our hand the bravest Grecian bleeds,
Not long the deathful dart he can sustain;
Or Phoebus urged me to these fields in vain."
So spoke he, boastful: but the winged dart
Stopp'd short of life, and mock'd the shooter's art.
The wounded chief, behind his car retired,
The helping hand of Sthenelus required;
Swift from his seat he leap'd upon the ground,
And tugg'd the weapon from the gushing wound;
When thus the king his guardian power address'd,
The purple current wandering o'er his vest:

"O progeny of Jove! unconquer'd maid!
If e'er my godlike sire deserved thy aid,
If e'er I felt thee in the fighting field;
Now, goddess, now, thy sacred succour yield.
O give my lance to reach the Trojan knight,
Whose arrow wounds the chief thou guard'st in fight;
And lay the boaster grovelling on the shore,
That vaunts these eyes shall view the light no more."

Thus pray'd Tydides, and Minerva heard,
His nerves confirm'd, his languid spirits cheer'd;
He feels each limb with wonted vigour light;
His beating bosom claim'd the promised fight.
"Be bold, (she cried), in every combat shine,
War be thy province, thy protection mine;
Rush to the fight, and every foe control;
Wake each paternal virtue in thy soul:
Strength swells thy boiling breast, infused by me,
And all thy godlike father breathes in thee;
Yet more, from mortal mists I purge thy eyes,(145)
And set to view the warring deities.
These see thou shun, through all the embattled plain;
Nor rashly strive where human force is vain.
If Venus mingle in the martial band,
Her shalt thou wound: so Pallas gives command."

With that, the blue-eyed virgin wing'd her flight;
The hero rush'd impetuous to the fight;
With tenfold ardour now invades the plain,
Wild with delay, and more enraged by pain.
As on the fleecy flocks when hunger calls,
Amidst the field a brindled lion falls;
If chance some shepherd with a distant dart
The savage wound, he rouses at the smart,
He foams, he roars; the shepherd dares not stay,
But trembling leaves the scattering flocks a prey;
Heaps fall on heaps; he bathes with blood the ground,
Then leaps victorious o'er the lofty mound.
Not with less fury stern Tydides flew;
And two brave leaders at an instant slew;
Astynous breathless fell, and by his side,
His people's pastor, good Hypenor, died;
Astynous' breast the deadly lance receives,
Hypenor's shoulder his broad falchion cleaves.
Those slain he left, and sprung with noble rage
Abas and Polyidus to engage;
Sons of Eurydamus, who, wise and old,
Could fate foresee, and mystic dreams unfold;
The youths return'd not from the doubtful plain,
And the sad father tried his arts in vain;
No mystic dream could make their fates appear,
Though now determined by Tydides' spear.

Young Xanthus next, and Thoon felt his rage;
The joy and hope of Phaenops' feeble age:
Vast was his wealth, and these the only heirs
Of all his labours and a life of cares.
Cold death o'ertakes them in their blooming years,
And leaves the father unavailing tears:
To strangers now descends his heapy store,
The race forgotten, and the name no more.

Two sons of Priam in one chariot ride,
Glittering in arms, and combat side by side.
As when the lordly lion seeks his food
Where grazing heifers range the lonely wood,
He leaps amidst them with a furious bound,
Bends their strong necks, and tears them to the ground:
So from their seats the brother chiefs are torn,
Their steeds and chariot to the navy borne.

With deep concern divine Ćneas view'd
The foe prevailing, and his friends pursued;
Through the thick storm of singing spears he flies,
Exploring Pandarus with careful eyes.
At length he found Lycaon's mighty son;
To whom the chief of Venus' race begun:

"Where, Pandarus, are all thy honours now,
Thy winged arrows and unerring bow,
Thy matchless skill, thy yet unrivall'd fame,
And boasted glory of the Lycian name?
O pierce that mortal! if we mortal call
That wondrous force by which whole armies fall;
Or god incensed, who quits the distant skies
To punish Troy for slighted sacrifice;
(Which, oh avert from our unhappy state!
For what so dreadful as celestial hate)?
Whoe'er he be, propitiate Jove with prayer;
If man, destroy; if god, entreat to spare."

To him the Lycian: "Whom your eyes behold,
If right I judge, is Diomed the bold:
Such coursers whirl him o'er the dusty field,
So towers his helmet, and so flames his shield.
If 'tis a god, he wears that chief's disguise:
Or if that chief, some guardian of the skies,
Involved in clouds, protects him in the fray,
And turns unseen the frustrate dart away.
I wing'd an arrow, which not idly fell,
The stroke had fix'd him to the gates of hell;
And, but some god, some angry god withstands,
His fate was due to these unerring hands.
Skill'd in the bow, on foot I sought the war,
Nor join'd swift horses to the rapid car.
Ten polish'd chariots I possess'd at home,
And still they grace Lycaon's princely dome:
There veil'd in spacious coverlets they stand;
And twice ten coursers wait their lord's command.
The good old warrior bade me trust to these,
When first for Troy I sail'd the sacred seas;
In fields, aloft, the whirling car to guide,
And through the ranks of death triumphant ride.
But vain with youth, and yet to thrift inclined,
I heard his counsels with unheedful mind,
And thought the steeds (your large supplies unknown)
Might fail of forage in the straiten'd town;
So took my bow and pointed darts in hand
And left the chariots in my native land.

"Too late, O friend! my rashness I deplore;
These shafts, once fatal, carry death no more.
Tydeus' and Atreus' sons their points have found,
And undissembled gore pursued the wound.
In vain they bleed: this unavailing bow
Serves, not to slaughter, but provoke the foe.
In evil hour these bended horns I strung,
And seized the quiver where it idly hung.
Cursed be the fate that sent me to the field
Without a warrior's arms, the spear and shield!
If e'er with life I quit the Trojan plain,
If e'er I see my spouse and sire again,
This bow, unfaithful to my glorious aims,
Broke by my hand, shall feed the blazing flames."

To whom the leader of the Dardan race:
"Be calm, nor Phoebus' honour'd gift disgrace.
The distant dart be praised, though here we need
The rushing chariot and the bounding steed.
Against yon hero let us bend our course,
And, hand to hand, encounter force with force.
Now mount my seat, and from the chariot's height
Observe my father's steeds, renown'd in fight;
Practised alike to turn, to stop, to chase,
To dare the shock, or urge the rapid race;
Secure with these, through fighting fields we go;
Or safe to Troy, if Jove assist the foe.
Haste, seize the whip, and snatch the guiding rein;
The warrior's fury let this arm sustain;
Or, if to combat thy bold heart incline,
Take thou the spear, the chariot's care be mine."

"O prince! (Lycaon's valiant son replied)
As thine the steeds, be thine the task to guide.
The horses, practised to their lord's command,
Shall bear the rein, and answer to thy hand;
But, if, unhappy, we desert the fight,
Thy voice alone can animate their flight;
Else shall our fates be number'd with the dead,
And these, the victor's prize, in triumph led.
Thine be the guidance, then: with spear and shield
Myself will charge this terror of the field."

And now both heroes mount the glittering car;
The bounding coursers rush amidst the war;
Their fierce approach bold Sthenelus espied,
Who thus, alarm'd, to great Tydides cried:

"O friend! two chiefs of force immense I see,
Dreadful they come, and bend their rage on thee:
Lo the brave heir of old Lycaon's line,
And great Ćneas, sprung from race divine!
Enough is given to fame. Ascend thy car!
And save a life, the bulwark of our war."

At this the hero cast a gloomy look,
Fix'd on the chief with scorn; and thus he spoke:

"Me dost thou bid to shun the coming fight?
Me wouldst thou move to base, inglorious flight?
Know, 'tis not honest in my soul to fear,
Nor was Tydides born to tremble here.
I hate the cumbrous chariot's slow advance,
And the long distance of the flying lance;
But while my nerves are strong, my force entire,
Thus front the foe, and emulate my sire.
Nor shall yon steeds, that fierce to fight convey
Those threatening heroes, bear them both away;
One chief at least beneath this arm shall die;
So Pallas tells me, and forbids to fly.
But if she dooms, and if no god withstand,
That both shall fall by one victorious hand,
Then heed my words: my horses here detain,
Fix'd to the chariot by the straiten'd rein;
Swift to Ćneas' empty seat proceed,
And seize the coursers of ethereal breed;
The race of those, which once the thundering god(146)
For ravish'd Ganymede on Tros bestow'd,
The best that e'er on earth's broad surface run,
Beneath the rising or the setting sun.
Hence great Anchises stole a breed unknown,
By mortal mares, from fierce Laomedon:
Four of this race his ample stalls contain,
And two transport Ćneas o'er the plain.
These, were the rich immortal prize our own,
Through the wide world should make our glory known."

Thus while they spoke, the foe came furious on,
And stern Lycaon's warlike race begun:

"Prince, thou art met. Though late in vain assail'd,
The spear may enter where the arrow fail'd."

He said, then shook the ponderous lance, and flung;
On his broad shield the sounding weapon rung,
Pierced the tough orb, and in his cuirass hung,
"He bleeds! the pride of Greece! (the boaster cries,)
Our triumph now, the mighty warrior lies!"
"Mistaken vaunter! (Diomed replied;)
Thy dart has erred, and now my spear be tried;
Ye 'scape not both; one, headlong from his car,
With hostile blood shall glut the god of war."

He spoke, and rising hurl'd his forceful dart,
Which, driven by Pallas, pierced a vital part;
Full in his face it enter'd, and betwixt
The nose and eye-ball the proud Lycian fix'd;
Crash'd all his jaws, and cleft the tongue within,
Till the bright point look'd out beneath the chin.
Headlong he falls, his helmet knocks the ground:
Earth groans beneath him, and his arms resound;
The starting coursers tremble with affright;
The soul indignant seeks the realms of night.

To guard his slaughter'd friend, Ćneas flies,
His spear extending where the carcase lies;
Watchful he wheels, protects it every way,
As the grim lion stalks around his prey.
O'er the fall'n trunk his ample shield display'd,
He hides the hero with his mighty shade,
And threats aloud! the Greeks with longing eyes
Behold at distance, but forbear the prize.
Then fierce Tydides stoops; and from the fields
Heaved with vast force, a rocky fragment wields.
Not two strong men the enormous weight could raise,
Such men as live in these degenerate days:(147)
He swung it round; and, gathering strength to throw,
Discharged the ponderous ruin at the foe.
Where to the hip the inserted thigh unites,
Full on the bone the pointed marble lights;
Through both the tendons broke the rugged stone,
And stripp'd the skin, and crack'd the solid bone.
Sunk on his knees, and staggering with his pains,
His falling bulk his bended arm sustains;
Lost in a dizzy mist the warrior lies;
A sudden cloud comes swimming o'er his eyes.
There the brave chief, who mighty numbers sway'd,
Oppress'd had sunk to death's eternal shade,
But heavenly Venus, mindful of the love
She bore Anchises in the Idaean grove,
His danger views with anguish and despair,
And guards her offspring with a mother's care.
About her much-loved son her arms she throws,
Her arms whose whiteness match the falling snows.
Screen'd from the foe behind her shining veil,
The swords wave harmless, and the javelins fail;
Safe through the rushing horse, and feather'd flight
Of sounding shafts, she bears him from the fight.

Nor Sthenelus, with unassisting hands,
Remain'd unheedful of his lord's commands:
His panting steeds, removed from out the war,
He fix'd with straiten'd traces to the car,
Next, rushing to the Dardan spoil, detains
The heavenly coursers with the flowing manes:
These in proud triumph to the fleet convey'd,
No longer now a Trojan lord obey'd.
That charge to bold Deipylus he gave,
(Whom most he loved, as brave men love the brave,)
Then mounting on his car, resumed the rein,
And follow'd where Tydides swept the plain.

Meanwhile (his conquest ravished from his eyes)
The raging chief in chase of Venus flies:
No goddess she, commission'd to the field,
Like Pallas dreadful with her sable shield,
Or fierce Bellona thundering at the wall,
While flames ascend, and mighty ruins fall;
He knew soft combats suit the tender dame,
New to the field, and still a foe to fame.
Through breaking ranks his furious course he bends,
And at the goddess his broad lance extends;
Through her bright veil the daring weapon drove,
The ambrosial veil which all the Graces wove;
Her snowy hand the razing steel profaned,
And the transparent skin with crimson stain'd,
From the clear vein a stream immortal flow'd,
Such stream as issues from a wounded god;(148)
Pure emanation! uncorrupted flood!
Unlike our gross, diseased, terrestrial blood:
(For not the bread of man their life sustains,
Nor wine's inflaming juice supplies their veins:)
With tender shrieks the goddess fill'd the place,
And dropp'd her offspring from her weak embrace.
Him Phoebus took: he casts a cloud around
The fainting chief, and wards the mortal wound.

Then with a voice that shook the vaulted skies,
The king insults the goddess as she flies:
"Ill with Jove's daughter bloody fights agree,
The field of combat is no scene for thee:
Go, let thy own soft sex employ thy care,
Go, lull the coward, or delude the fair.
Taught by this stroke renounce the war's alarms,
And learn to tremble at the name of arms."

Tydides thus. The goddess, seized with dread,
Confused, distracted, from the conflict fled.
To aid her, swift the winged Iris flew,
Wrapt in a mist above the warring crew.
The queen of love with faded charms she found.
Pale was her cheek, and livid look'd the wound.
To Mars, who sat remote, they bent their way:
Far, on the left, with clouds involved he lay;
Beside him stood his lance, distain'd with gore,
And, rein'd with gold, his foaming steeds before.
Low at his knee, she begg'd with streaming eyes
Her brother's car, to mount the distant skies,
And show'd the wound by fierce Tydides given,
A mortal man, who dares encounter heaven.
Stern Mars attentive hears the queen complain,
And to her hand commits the golden rein;
She mounts the seat, oppress'd with silent woe,
Driven by the goddess of the painted bow.
The lash resounds, the rapid chariot flies,
And in a moment scales the lofty skies:
They stopp'd the car, and there the coursers stood,
Fed by fair Iris with ambrosial food;
Before her mother, love's bright queen appears,
O'erwhelmed with anguish, and dissolved in tears:
She raised her in her arms, beheld her bleed,
And ask'd what god had wrought this guilty deed?

[Illustration: VENUS, WOUNDED IN THE HAND, CONDUCTED BY IRIS TO MARS.]

        VENUS, WOUNDED IN THE HAND, CONDUCTED BY IRIS TO MARS.


Then she: "This insult from no god I found,
An impious mortal gave the daring wound!
Behold the deed of haughty Diomed!
'Twas in the son's defence the mother bled.
The war with Troy no more the Grecians wage;
But with the gods (the immortal gods) engage."

Dione then: "Thy wrongs with patience bear,
And share those griefs inferior powers must share:
Unnumber'd woes mankind from us sustain,
And men with woes afflict the gods again.
The mighty Mars in mortal fetters bound,(149)
And lodged in brazen dungeons underground,
Full thirteen moons imprison'd roar'd in vain;
Otus and Ephialtes held the chain:
Perhaps had perish'd had not Hermes' care
Restored the groaning god to upper air.
Great Juno's self has borne her weight of pain,
The imperial partner of the heavenly reign;
Amphitryon's son infix'd the deadly dart,(150)
And fill'd with anguish her immortal heart.
E'en hell's grim king Alcides' power confess'd,
The shaft found entrance in his iron breast;
To Jove's high palace for a cure he fled,
Pierced in his own dominions of the dead;
Where Paeon, sprinkling heavenly balm around,
Assuaged the glowing pangs, and closed the wound.
Rash, impious man! to stain the bless'd abodes,
And drench his arrows in the blood of gods!

       [Illustration: OTUS AND EPHIALTES HOLDING MARS CAPTIVE.]

               OTUS AND EPHIALTES HOLDING MARS CAPTIVE.


"But thou (though Pallas urged thy frantic deed),
Whose spear ill-fated makes a goddess bleed,
Know thou, whoe'er with heavenly power contends,
Short is his date, and soon his glory ends;
From fields of death when late he shall retire,
No infant on his knees shall call him sire.
Strong as thou art, some god may yet be found,
To stretch thee pale and gasping on the ground;
Thy distant wife, Ćgiale the fair,(151)
Starting from sleep with a distracted air,
Shall rouse thy slaves, and her lost lord deplore,
The brave, the great, the glorious now no more!"

This said, she wiped from Venus' wounded palm
The sacred ichor, and infused the balm.
Juno and Pallas with a smile survey'd,
And thus to Jove began the blue-eyed maid:

"Permit thy daughter, gracious Jove! to tell
How this mischance the Cyprian queen befell,
As late she tried with passion to inflame
The tender bosom of a Grecian dame;
Allured the fair, with moving thoughts of joy,
To quit her country for some youth of Troy;
The clasping zone, with golden buckles bound,
Razed her soft hand with this lamented wound."

The sire of gods and men superior smiled,
And, calling Venus, thus address'd his child:
"Not these, O daughter are thy proper cares,
Thee milder arts befit, and softer wars;
Sweet smiles are thine, and kind endearing charms;
To Mars and Pallas leave the deeds of arms."

Thus they in heaven: while on the plain below
The fierce Tydides charged his Dardan foe,
Flush'd with celestial blood pursued his way,
And fearless dared the threatening god of day;
Already in his hopes he saw him kill'd,
Though screen'd behind Apollo's mighty shield.
Thrice rushing furious, at the chief he strook;
His blazing buckler thrice Apollo shook:
He tried the fourth: when, breaking from the cloud,
A more than mortal voice was heard aloud.

"O son of Tydeus, cease! be wise and see
How vast the difference of the gods and thee;
Distance immense! between the powers that shine
Above, eternal, deathless, and divine,
And mortal man! a wretch of humble birth,
A short-lived reptile in the dust of earth."

So spoke the god who darts celestial fires:
He dreads his fury, and some steps retires.
Then Phoebus bore the chief of Venus' race
To Troy's high fane, and to his holy place;
Latona there and Phoebe heal'd the wound,
With vigour arm'd him, and with glory crown'd.
This done, the patron of the silver bow
A phantom raised, the same in shape and show
With great Ćneas; such the form he bore,
And such in fight the radiant arms he wore.
Around the spectre bloody wars are waged,
And Greece and Troy with clashing shields engaged.
Meantime on Ilion's tower Apollo stood,
And calling Mars, thus urged the raging god:

"Stern power of arms, by whom the mighty fall;
Who bathest in blood, and shakest the embattled wall,
Rise in thy wrath! to hell's abhorr'd abodes
Despatch yon Greek, and vindicate the gods.
First rosy Venus felt his brutal rage;
Me next he charged, and dares all heaven engage:
The wretch would brave high heaven's immortal sire,
His triple thunder, and his bolts of fire."

The god of battle issues on the plain,
Stirs all the ranks, and fires the Trojan train;
In form like Acamas, the Thracian guide,
Enraged to Troy's retiring chiefs he cried:

"How long, ye sons of Priam! will ye fly,
And unrevenged see Priam's people die?
Still unresisted shall the foe destroy,
And stretch the slaughter to the gates of Troy?
Lo, brave Ćneas sinks beneath his wound,
Not godlike Hector more in arms renown'd:
Haste all, and take the generous warrior's part.
He said;--new courage swell'd each hero's heart.
Sarpedon first his ardent soul express'd,
And, turn'd to Hector, these bold words address'd:

"Say, chief, is all thy ancient valour lost?
Where are thy threats, and where thy glorious boast,
That propp'd alone by Priam's race should stand
Troy's sacred walls, nor need a foreign hand?
Now, now thy country calls her wonted friends,
And the proud vaunt in just derision ends.
Remote they stand while alien troops engage,
Like trembling hounds before the lion's rage.
Far distant hence I held my wide command,
Where foaming Xanthus laves the Lycian land;
With ample wealth (the wish of mortals) bless'd,
A beauteous wife, and infant at her breast;
With those I left whatever dear could be:
Greece, if she conquers, nothing wins from me;
Yet first in fight my Lycian bands I cheer,
And long to meet this mighty man ye fear;
While Hector idle stands, nor bids the brave
Their wives, their infants, and their altars save.
Haste, warrior, haste! preserve thy threaten'd state,
Or one vast burst of all-involving fate
Full o'er your towers shall fall, and sweep away
Sons, sires, and wives, an undistinguish'd prey.
Rouse all thy Trojans, urge thy aids to fight;
These claim thy thoughts by day, thy watch by night;
With force incessant the brave Greeks oppose;
Such cares thy friends deserve, and such thy foes."

Stung to the heart the generous Hector hears,
But just reproof with decent silence bears.
From his proud car the prince impetuous springs,
On earth he leaps, his brazen armour rings.
Two shining spears are brandish'd in his hands;
Thus arm'd, he animates his drooping bands,
Revives their ardour, turns their steps from flight,
And wakes anew the dying flames of fight.
They turn, they stand; the Greeks their fury dare,
Condense their powers, and wait the growing war.

As when, on Ceres' sacred floor, the swain
Spreads the wide fan to clear the golden grain,
And the light chaff, before the breezes borne,
Ascends in clouds from off the heapy corn;
The grey dust, rising with collected winds,
Drives o'er the barn, and whitens all the hinds:
So white with dust the Grecian host appears.
From trampling steeds, and thundering charioteers;
The dusky clouds from labour'd earth arise,
And roll in smoking volumes to the skies.
Mars hovers o'er them with his sable shield,
And adds new horrors to the darken'd field:
Pleased with his charge, and ardent to fulfil,
In Troy's defence, Apollo's heavenly will:
Soon as from fight the blue-eyed maid retires,
Each Trojan bosom with new warmth he fires.
And now the god, from forth his sacred fane,
Produced Ćneas to the shouting train;
Alive, unharm'd, with all his peers around,
Erect he stood, and vigorous from his wound:
Inquiries none they made; the dreadful day
No pause of words admits, no dull delay;
Fierce Discord storms, Apollo loud exclaims,
Fame calls, Mars thunders, and the field's in flames.

Stern Diomed with either Ajax stood,
And great Ulysses, bathed in hostile blood.
Embodied close, the labouring Grecian train
The fiercest shock of charging hosts sustain.
Unmoved and silent, the whole war they wait
Serenely dreadful, and as fix'd as fate.
So when the embattled clouds in dark array,
Along the skies their gloomy lines display;
When now the North his boisterous rage has spent,
And peaceful sleeps the liquid element:
The low-hung vapours, motionless and still,
Rest on the summits of the shaded hill;
Till the mass scatters as the winds arise,
Dispersed and broken through the ruffled skies.

Nor was the general wanting to his train;
From troop to troop he toils through all the plain,
"Ye Greeks, be men! the charge of battle bear;
Your brave associates and yourselves revere!
Let glorious acts more glorious acts inspire,
And catch from breast to breast the noble fire!
On valour's side the odds of combat lie,
The brave live glorious, or lamented die;
The wretch who trembles in the field of fame,
Meets death, and worse than death, eternal shame!"

These words he seconds with his flying lance,
To meet whose point was strong Deicoon's chance:
Ćneas' friend, and in his native place
Honour'd and loved like Priam's royal race:
Long had he fought the foremost in the field,
But now the monarch's lance transpierced his shield:
His shield too weak the furious dart to stay,
Through his broad belt the weapon forced its way:
The grisly wound dismiss'd his soul to hell,
His arms around him rattled as he fell.

Then fierce Ćneas, brandishing his blade,
In dust Orsilochus and Crethon laid,
Whose sire Diocleus, wealthy, brave and great,
In well-built Pherae held his lofty seat:(152)
Sprung from Alpheus' plenteous stream, that yields
Increase of harvests to the Pylian fields.
He got Orsilochus, Diocleus he,
And these descended in the third degree.
Too early expert in the martial toil,
In sable ships they left their native soil,
To avenge Atrides: now, untimely slain,
They fell with glory on the Phrygian plain.
So two young mountain lions, nursed with blood
In deep recesses of the gloomy wood,
Rush fearless to the plains, and uncontroll'd
Depopulate the stalls and waste the fold:
Till pierced at distance from their native den,
O'erpowered they fall beneath the force of men.
Prostrate on earth their beauteous bodies lay,
Like mountain firs, as tall and straight as they.
Great Menelaus views with pitying eyes,
Lifts his bright lance, and at the victor flies;
Mars urged him on; yet, ruthless in his hate,
The god but urged him to provoke his fate.
He thus advancing, Nestor's valiant son
Shakes for his danger, and neglects his own;
Struck with the thought, should Helen's lord be slain,
And all his country's glorious labours vain.
Already met, the threatening heroes stand;
The spears already tremble in their hand:
In rush'd Antilochus, his aid to bring,
And fall or conquer by the Spartan king.
These seen, the Dardan backward turn'd his course,
Brave as he was, and shunn'd unequal force.
The breathless bodies to the Greeks they drew,
Then mix in combat, and their toils renew.

First, Pylaemenes, great in battle, bled,
Who sheathed in brass the Paphlagonians led.
Atrides mark'd him where sublime he stood;
Fix'd in his throat the javelin drank his blood.
The faithful Mydon, as he turn'd from fight
His flying coursers, sunk to endless night;
A broken rock by Nestor's son was thrown:
His bended arm received the falling stone;
From his numb'd hand the ivory-studded reins,
Dropp'd in the dust, are trail'd along the plains:
Meanwhile his temples feel a deadly wound;
He groans in death, and ponderous sinks to ground:
Deep drove his helmet in the sands, and there
The head stood fix'd, the quivering legs in air,
Till trampled flat beneath the coursers' feet:
The youthful victor mounts his empty seat,
And bears the prize in triumph to the fleet.

Great Hector saw, and, raging at the view,
Pours on the Greeks: the Trojan troops pursue:
He fires his host with animating cries,
And brings along the furies of the skies,
Mars, stern destroyer! and Bellona dread,
Flame in the front, and thunder at their head:
This swells the tumult and the rage of fight;
That shakes a spear that casts a dreadful light.
Where Hector march'd, the god of battles shined,
Now storm'd before him, and now raged behind.

Tydides paused amidst his full career;
Then first the hero's manly breast knew fear.
As when some simple swain his cot forsakes,
And wide through fens an unknown journey takes:
If chance a swelling brook his passage stay,
And foam impervious 'cross the wanderer's way,
Confused he stops, a length of country pass'd,
Eyes the rough waves, and tired, returns at last.
Amazed no less the great Tydides stands:
He stay'd, and turning thus address'd his bands:

"No wonder, Greeks! that all to Hector yield;
Secure of favouring gods, he takes the field;
His strokes they second, and avert our spears.
Behold where Mars in mortal arms appears!
Retire then, warriors, but sedate and slow;
Retire, but with your faces to the foe.
Trust not too much your unavailing might;
'Tis not with Troy, but with the gods ye fight."

Now near the Greeks the black battalions drew;
And first two leaders valiant Hector slew:
His force Anchialus and Mnesthes found,
In every art of glorious war renown'd;
In the same car the chiefs to combat ride,
And fought united, and united died.
Struck at the sight, the mighty Ajax glows
With thirst of vengeance, and assaults the foes.
His massy spear with matchless fury sent,
Through Amphius' belt and heaving belly went;
Amphius Apaesus' happy soil possess'd,
With herds abounding, and with treasure bless'd;
But fate resistless from his country led
The chief, to perish at his people's head.
Shook with his fall his brazen armour rung,
And fierce, to seize it, conquering Ajax sprung;
Around his head an iron tempest rain'd;
A wood of spears his ample shield sustain'd:
Beneath one foot the yet warm corpse he press'd,
And drew his javelin from the bleeding breast:
He could no more; the showering darts denied
To spoil his glittering arms, and plumy pride.
Now foes on foes came pouring on the fields,
With bristling lances, and compacted shields;
Till in the steely circle straiten'd round,
Forced he gives way, and sternly quits the ground.

While thus they strive, Tlepolemus the great,(153)
Urged by the force of unresisted fate,
Burns with desire Sarpedon's strength to prove;
Alcides' offspring meets the son of Jove.
Sheathed in bright arms each adverse chief came on.
Jove's great descendant, and his greater son.
Prepared for combat, ere the lance he toss'd,
The daring Rhodian vents his haughty boast:

"What brings this Lycian counsellor so far,
To tremble at our arms, not mix in war!
Know thy vain self, nor let their flattery move,
Who style thee son of cloud-compelling Jove.
How far unlike those chiefs of race divine,
How vast the difference of their deeds and thine!
Jove got such heroes as my sire, whose soul
No fear could daunt, nor earth nor hell control.
Troy felt his arm, and yon proud ramparts stand
Raised on the ruins of his vengeful hand:
With six small ships, and but a slender train,
He left the town a wide-deserted plain.
But what art thou, who deedless look'st around,
While unrevenged thy Lycians bite the ground!
Small aid to Troy thy feeble force can be;
But wert thou greater, thou must yield to me.
Pierced by my spear, to endless darkness go!
I make this present to the shades below."

The son of Hercules, the Rhodian guide,
Thus haughty spoke. The Lycian king replied:

"Thy sire, O prince! o'erturn'd the Trojan state,
Whose perjured monarch well deserved his fate;
Those heavenly steeds the hero sought so far,
False he detain'd, the just reward of war.
Nor so content, the generous chief defied,
With base reproaches and unmanly pride.
But you, unworthy the high race you boast,
Shall raise my glory when thy own is lost:
Now meet thy fate, and by Sarpedon slain,
Add one more ghost to Pluto's gloomy reign."

He said: both javelins at an instant flew;
Both struck, both wounded, but Sarpedon's slew:
Full in the boaster's neck the weapon stood,
Transfix'd his throat, and drank the vital blood;
The soul disdainful seeks the caves of night,
And his seal'd eyes for ever lose the light.

Yet not in vain, Tlepolemus, was thrown
Thy angry lance; which piercing to the bone
Sarpedon's thigh, had robb'd the chief of breath;
But Jove was present, and forbade the death.
Borne from the conflict by his Lycian throng,
The wounded hero dragg'd the lance along.
(His friends, each busied in his several part,
Through haste, or danger, had not drawn the dart.)
The Greeks with slain Tlepolemus retired;
Whose fall Ulysses view'd, with fury fired;
Doubtful if Jove's great son he should pursue,
Or pour his vengeance on the Lycian crew.
But heaven and fate the first design withstand,
Nor this great death must grace Ulysses' hand.
Minerva drives him on the Lycian train;
Alastor, Cronius, Halius, strew'd the plain,
Alcander, Prytanis, Noemon fell:(154)
And numbers more his sword had sent to hell,
But Hector saw; and, furious at the sight,
Rush'd terrible amidst the ranks of fight.
With joy Sarpedon view'd the wish'd relief,
And, faint, lamenting, thus implored the chief:

"O suffer not the foe to bear away
My helpless corpse, an unassisted prey;
If I, unbless'd, must see my son no more,
My much-loved consort, and my native shore,
Yet let me die in Ilion's sacred wall;
Troy, in whose cause I fell, shall mourn my fall."

He said, nor Hector to the chief replies,
But shakes his plume, and fierce to combat flies;
Swift as a whirlwind, drives the scattering foes;
And dyes the ground with purple as he goes.

Beneath a beech, Jove's consecrated shade,
His mournful friends divine Sarpedon laid:
Brave Pelagon, his favourite chief, was nigh,
Who wrench'd the javelin from his sinewy thigh.
The fainting soul stood ready wing'd for flight,
And o'er his eye-balls swam the shades of night;
But Boreas rising fresh, with gentle breath,
Recall'd his spirit from the gates of death.

The generous Greeks recede with tardy pace,
Though Mars and Hector thunder in their face;
None turn their backs to mean ignoble flight,
Slow they retreat, and even retreating fight.
Who first, who last, by Mars' and Hector's hand,
Stretch'd in their blood, lay gasping on the sand?
Tenthras the great, Orestes the renown'd
For managed steeds, and Trechus press'd the ground;,
Next OEnomaus and OEnops' offspring died;
Oresbius last fell groaning at their side:
Oresbius, in his painted mitre gay,
In fat Boeotia held his wealthy sway,
Where lakes surround low Hyle's watery plain;
A prince and people studious of their gain.

The carnage Juno from the skies survey'd,
And touch'd with grief bespoke the blue-eyed maid:
"Oh, sight accursed! Shall faithless Troy prevail,
And shall our promise to our people fail?
How vain the word to Menelaus given
By Jove's great daughter and the queen of heaven,
Beneath his arms that Priam's towers should fall,
If warring gods for ever guard the wall!
Mars, red with slaughter, aids our hated foes:
Haste, let us arm, and force with force oppose!"

She spoke; Minerva burns to meet the war:
And now heaven's empress calls her blazing car.
At her command rush forth the steeds divine;
Rich with immortal gold their trappings shine.
Bright Hebe waits; by Hebe, ever young,
The whirling wheels are to the chariot hung.
On the bright axle turns the bidden wheel
Of sounding brass; the polished axle steel.
Eight brazen spokes in radiant order flame;
The circles gold, of uncorrupted frame,
Such as the heavens produce: and round the gold
Two brazen rings of work divine were roll'd.
The bossy naves of sold silver shone;
Braces of gold suspend the moving throne:
The car, behind, an arching figure bore;
The bending concave form'd an arch before.
Silver the beam, the extended yoke was gold,
And golden reins the immortal coursers hold.
Herself, impatient, to the ready car,
The coursers joins, and breathes revenge and war.

Pallas disrobes; her radiant veil untied,
With flowers adorn'd, with art diversified,
(The laboured veil her heavenly fingers wove,)
Flows on the pavement of the court of Jove.
Now heaven's dread arms her mighty limbs invest,
Jove's cuirass blazes on her ample breast;
Deck'd in sad triumph for the mournful field,
O'er her broad shoulders hangs his horrid shield,
Dire, black, tremendous! Round the margin roll'd,
A fringe of serpents hissing guards the gold:
Here all the terrors of grim War appear,
Here rages Force, here tremble Flight and Fear,
Here storm'd Contention, and here Fury frown'd,
And the dire orb portentous Gorgon crown'd.
The massy golden helm she next assumes,
That dreadful nods with four o'ershading plumes;
So vast, the broad circumference contains
A hundred armies on a hundred plains.
The goddess thus the imperial car ascends;
Shook by her arm the mighty javelin bends,
Ponderous and huge; that when her fury burns,
Proud tyrants humbles, and whole hosts o'erturns.

Swift at the scourge the ethereal coursers fly,
While the smooth chariot cuts the liquid sky.
Heaven's gates spontaneous open to the powers,(155)
Heaven's golden gates, kept by the winged Hours;(156)
Commission'd in alternate watch they stand,
The sun's bright portals and the skies command,
Involve in clouds the eternal gates of day,
Or the dark barrier roll with ease away.
The sounding hinges ring on either side
The gloomy volumes, pierced with light, divide.
The chariot mounts, where deep in ambient skies,
Confused, Olympus' hundred heads arise;
Where far apart the Thunderer fills his throne,
O'er all the gods superior and alone.
There with her snowy hand the queen restrains
The fiery steeds, and thus to Jove complains:

"O sire! can no resentment touch thy soul?
Can Mars rebel, and does no thunder roll?
What lawless rage on yon forbidden plain,
What rash destruction! and what heroes slain!
Venus, and Phoebus with the dreadful bow,
Smile on the slaughter, and enjoy my woe.
Mad, furious power! whose unrelenting mind
No god can govern, and no justice bind.
Say, mighty father! shall we scourge this pride,
And drive from fight the impetuous homicide?"

To whom assenting, thus the Thunderer said:
"Go! and the great Minerva be thy aid.
To tame the monster-god Minerva knows,
And oft afflicts his brutal breast with woes."

He said; Saturnia, ardent to obey,
Lash'd her white steeds along the aerial way
Swift down the steep of heaven the chariot rolls,
Between the expanded earth and starry poles
Far as a shepherd, from some point on high,(157)
O'er the wide main extends his boundless eye,
Through such a space of air, with thundering sound,
At every leap the immortal coursers bound
Troy now they reach'd and touch'd those banks divine,
Where silver Simois and Scamander join
There Juno stopp'd, and (her fair steeds unloosed)
Of air condensed a vapour circumfused
For these, impregnate with celestial dew,
On Simois, brink ambrosial herbage grew.
Thence to relieve the fainting Argive throng,
Smooth as the sailing doves they glide along.

The best and bravest of the Grecian band
(A warlike circle) round Tydides stand.
Such was their look as lions bathed in blood,
Or foaming boars, the terror of the wood
Heaven's empress mingles with the mortal crowd,
And shouts, in Stentor's sounding voice, aloud;
Stentor the strong, endued with brazen lungs,(158)
Whose throats surpass'd the force of fifty tongues.

"Inglorious Argives! to your race a shame,
And only men in figure and in name!
Once from the walls your timorous foes engaged,
While fierce in war divine Achilles raged;
Now issuing fearless they possess the plain,
Now win the shores, and scarce the seas remain."

Her speech new fury to their hearts convey'd;
While near Tydides stood the Athenian maid;
The king beside his panting steeds she found,
O'erspent with toil reposing on the ground;
To cool his glowing wound he sat apart,
(The wound inflicted by the Lycian dart.)
Large drops of sweat from all his limbs descend,
Beneath his ponderous shield his sinews bend,
Whose ample belt, that o'er his shoulder lay,
He eased; and wash'd the clotted gore away.
The goddess leaning o'er the bending yoke,
Beside his coursers, thus her silence broke:

"Degenerate prince! and not of Tydeus' kind,
Whose little body lodged a mighty mind;
Foremost he press'd in glorious toils to share,
And scarce refrain'd when I forbade the war.
Alone, unguarded, once he dared to go,
And feast, incircled by the Theban foe;
There braved, and vanquish'd, many a hardy knight;
Such nerves I gave him, and such force in fight.
Thou too no less hast been my constant care;
Thy hands I arm'd, and sent thee forth to war:
But thee or fear deters, or sloth detains;
No drop of all thy father warms thy veins."

The chief thus answered mild: "Immortal maid!
I own thy presence, and confess thy aid.
Not fear, thou know'st, withholds me from the plains,
Nor sloth hath seized me, but thy word restrains:
From warring gods thou bad'st me turn my spear,
And Venus only found resistance here.
Hence, goddess! heedful of thy high commands,
Loth I gave way, and warn'd our Argive bands:
For Mars, the homicide, these eyes beheld,
With slaughter red, and raging round the field."

Then thus Minerva:--"Brave Tydides, hear!
Not Mars himself, nor aught immortal, fear.
Full on the god impel thy foaming horse:
Pallas commands, and Pallas lends thee force.
Rash, furious, blind, from these to those he flies,
And every side of wavering combat tries;
Large promise makes, and breaks the promise made:
Now gives the Grecians, now the Trojans aid."(159)

She said, and to the steeds approaching near,
Drew from his seat the martial charioteer.
The vigorous power the trembling car ascends,
Fierce for revenge; and Diomed attends:
The groaning axle bent beneath the load;
So great a hero, and so great a god.
She snatch'd the reins, she lash'd with all her force,
And full on Mars impelled the foaming horse:
But first, to hide her heavenly visage, spread
Black Orcus' helmet o'er her radiant head.

          [Illustration: DIOMED CASTING HIS SPEAR AT MARS.]

                  DIOMED CASTING HIS SPEAR AT MARS.


Just then gigantic Periphas lay slain,
The strongest warrior of the Ćtolian train;
The god, who slew him, leaves his prostrate prize
Stretch'd where he fell, and at Tydides flies.
Now rushing fierce, in equal arms appear
The daring Greek, the dreadful god of war!
Full at the chief, above his courser's head,
From Mars's arm the enormous weapon fled:
Pallas opposed her hand, and caused to glance
Far from the car the strong immortal lance.
Then threw the force of Tydeus' warlike son;
The javelin hiss'd; the goddess urged it on:
Where the broad cincture girt his armour round,
It pierced the god: his groin received the wound.
From the rent skin the warrior tugs again
The smoking steel. Mars bellows with the pain:
Loud as the roar encountering armies yield,
When shouting millions shake the thundering field.
Both armies start, and trembling gaze around;
And earth and heaven re-bellow to the sound.
As vapours blown by Auster's sultry breath,
Pregnant with plagues, and shedding seeds of death,
Beneath the rage of burning Sirius rise,
Choke the parch'd earth, and blacken all the skies;
In such a cloud the god from combat driven,
High o'er the dusky whirlwind scales the heaven.
Wild with his pain, he sought the bright abodes,
There sullen sat beneath the sire of gods,
Show'd the celestial blood, and with a groan
Thus pour'd his plaints before the immortal throne:

"Can Jove, supine, flagitious facts survey,
And brook the furies of this daring day?
For mortal men celestial powers engage,
And gods on gods exert eternal rage:
From thee, O father! all these ills we bear,
And thy fell daughter with the shield and spear;
Thou gavest that fury to the realms of light,
Pernicious, wild, regardless of the right.
All heaven beside reveres thy sovereign sway,
Thy voice we hear, and thy behests obey:
'Tis hers to offend, and even offending share
Thy breast, thy counsels, thy distinguish'd care:
So boundless she, and thou so partial grown,
Well may we deem the wondrous birth thy own.
Now frantic Diomed, at her command,
Against the immortals lifts his raging hand:
The heavenly Venus first his fury found,
Me next encountering, me he dared to wound;
Vanquish'd I fled; even I, the god of fight,
From mortal madness scarce was saved by flight.
Else hadst thou seen me sink on yonder plain,
Heap'd round, and heaving under loads of slain!
Or pierced with Grecian darts, for ages lie,
Condemn'd to pain, though fated not to die."

Him thus upbraiding, with a wrathful look
The lord of thunders view'd, and stern bespoke:
"To me, perfidious! this lamenting strain?
Of lawless force shall lawless Mars complain?
Of all the gods who tread the spangled skies,
Thou most unjust, most odious in our eyes!
Inhuman discord is thy dire delight,
The waste of slaughter, and the rage of fight.
No bounds, no law, thy fiery temper quells,
And all thy mother in thy soul rebels.
In vain our threats, in vain our power we use;
She gives the example, and her son pursues.
Yet long the inflicted pangs thou shall not mourn,
Sprung since thou art from Jove, and heavenly-born.
Else, singed with lightning, hadst thou hence been thrown,
Where chain'd on burning rocks the Titans groan."

Thus he who shakes Olympus with his nod;
Then gave to Paeon's care the bleeding god.(160)
With gentle hand the balm he pour'd around,
And heal'd the immortal flesh, and closed the wound.
As when the fig's press'd juice, infused in cream,
To curds coagulates the liquid stream,
Sudden the fluids fix the parts combined;
Such, and so soon, the ethereal texture join'd.
Cleansed from the dust and gore, fair Hebe dress'd
His mighty limbs in an immortal vest.
Glorious he sat, in majesty restored,
Fast by the throne of heaven's superior lord.
Juno and Pallas mount the bless'd abodes,
Their task perform'd, and mix among the gods.

                        [Illustration: JUNO.]

BOOK VI.


ARGUMENT.

THE EPISODES OF GLAUCUS AND DIOMED, AND OF HECTOR AND ANDROMACHE.

The gods having left the field, the Grecians prevail. Helenus, the chief
augur of Troy, commands Hector to return to the city, in order to appoint
a solemn procession of the queen and the Trojan matrons to the temple of
Minerva, to entreat her to remove Diomed from the fight. The battle
relaxing during the absence of Hector, Glaucus and Diomed have an
interview between the two armies; where, coming to the knowledge, of the
friendship and hospitality passed between their ancestors, they make
exchange of their arms. Hector, having performed the orders of Helenus,
prevails upon Paris to return to the battle, and, taking a tender leave of
his wife Andromache, hastens again to the field.

The scene is first in the field of battle, between the rivers Simois and
Scamander, and then changes to Troy.

Now heaven forsakes the fight: the immortals yield
To human force and human skill the field:
Dark showers of javelins fly from foes to foes;
Now here, now there, the tide of combat flows;
While Troy's famed streams, that bound the deathful plain
On either side, run purple to the main.

Great Ajax first to conquest led the way,
Broke the thick ranks, and turn'd the doubtful day.
The Thracian Acamas his falchion found,
And hew'd the enormous giant to the ground;
His thundering arm a deadly stroke impress'd
Where the black horse-hair nodded o'er his crest;
Fix'd in his front the brazen weapon lies,
And seals in endless shades his swimming eyes.
Next Teuthras' son distain'd the sands with blood,
Axylus, hospitable, rich, and good:
In fair Arisbe's walls (his native place)(161)
He held his seat! a friend to human race.
Fast by the road, his ever-open door
Obliged the wealthy, and relieved the poor.
To stern Tydides now he falls a prey,
No friend to guard him in the dreadful day!
Breathless the good man fell, and by his side
His faithful servant, old Calesius died.

By great Euryalus was Dresus slain,
And next he laid Opheltius on the plain.
Two twins were near, bold, beautiful, and young,
From a fair naiad and Bucolion sprung:
(Laomedon's white flocks Bucolion fed,
That monarch's first-born by a foreign bed;
In secret woods he won the naiad's grace,
And two fair infants crown'd his strong embrace:)
Here dead they lay in all their youthful charms;
The ruthless victor stripp'd their shining arms.

Astyalus by Polypoetes fell;
Ulysses' spear Pidytes sent to hell;
By Teucer's shaft brave Aretaon bled,
And Nestor's son laid stern Ablerus dead;
Great Agamemnon, leader of the brave,
The mortal wound of rich Elatus gave,
Who held in Pedasus his proud abode,(162)
And till'd the banks where silver Satnio flow'd.
Melanthius by Eurypylus was slain;
And Phylacus from Leitus flies in vain.

Unbless'd Adrastus next at mercy lies
Beneath the Spartan spear, a living prize.
Scared with the din and tumult of the fight,
His headlong steeds, precipitate in flight,
Rush'd on a tamarisk's strong trunk, and broke
The shatter'd chariot from the crooked yoke;
Wide o'er the field, resistless as the wind,
For Troy they fly, and leave their lord behind.
Prone on his face he sinks beside the wheel:
Atrides o'er him shakes his vengeful steel;
The fallen chief in suppliant posture press'd
The victor's knees, and thus his prayer address'd:

"O spare my youth, and for the life I owe
Large gifts of price my father shall bestow.
When fame shall tell, that, not in battle slain,
Thy hollow ships his captive son detain:
Rich heaps of brass shall in thy tent be told,(163)
And steel well-temper'd, and persuasive gold."

He said: compassion touch'd the hero's heart
He stood, suspended with the lifted dart:
As pity pleaded for his vanquish'd prize,
Stern Agamemnon swift to vengeance flies,
And, furious, thus: "Oh impotent of mind!(164)
Shall these, shall these Atrides' mercy find?
Well hast thou known proud Troy's perfidious land,
And well her natives merit at thy hand!
Not one of all the race, nor sex, nor age,
Shall save a Trojan from our boundless rage:
Ilion shall perish whole, and bury all;
Her babes, her infants at the breast, shall fall;(165)
A dreadful lesson of exampled fate,
To warn the nations, and to curb the great!"

The monarch spoke; the words, with warmth address'd,
To rigid justice steel'd his brother's breast
Fierce from his knees the hapless chief he thrust;
The monarch's javelin stretch'd him in the dust,
Then pressing with his foot his panting heart,
Forth from the slain he tugg'd the reeking dart.
Old Nestor saw, and roused the warrior's rage;
"Thus, heroes! thus the vigorous combat wage;
No son of Mars descend, for servile gains,
To touch the booty, while a foe remains.
Behold yon glittering host, your future spoil!
First gain the conquest, then reward the toil."

And now had Greece eternal fame acquired,
And frighted Troy within her walls, retired,
Had not sage Helenus her state redress'd,
Taught by the gods that moved his sacred breast.
Where Hector stood, with great Ćneas join'd,
The seer reveal'd the counsels of his mind:

"Ye generous chiefs! on whom the immortals lay
The cares and glories of this doubtful day;
On whom your aids, your country's hopes depend;
Wise to consult, and active to defend!
Here, at our gates, your brave efforts unite,
Turn back the routed, and forbid the flight,
Ere yet their wives' soft arms the cowards gain,
The sport and insult of the hostile train.
When your commands have hearten'd every band,
Ourselves, here fix'd, will make the dangerous stand;
Press'd as we are, and sore of former fight,
These straits demand our last remains of might.
Meanwhile thou, Hector, to the town retire,
And teach our mother what the gods require:
Direct the queen to lead the assembled train
Of Troy's chief matrons to Minerva's fane;(166)
Unbar the sacred gates, and seek the power,
With offer'd vows, in Ilion's topmost tower.
The largest mantle her rich wardrobes hold,
Most prized for art, and labour'd o'er with gold,
Before the goddess' honour'd knees be spread,
And twelve young heifers to her altars led:
If so the power, atoned by fervent prayer,
Our wives, our infants, and our city spare,
And far avert Tydides' wasteful ire,
That mows whole troops, and makes all Troy retire;
Not thus Achilles taught our hosts to dread,
Sprung though he was from more than mortal bed;
Not thus resistless ruled the stream of fight,
In rage unbounded, and unmatch'd in might."

Hector obedient heard: and, with a bound,
Leap'd from his trembling chariot to the ground;
Through all his host inspiring force he flies,
And bids the thunder of the battle rise.
With rage recruited the bold Trojans glow,
And turn the tide of conflict on the foe:
Fierce in the front he shakes two dazzling spears;
All Greece recedes, and 'midst her triumphs fears;
Some god, they thought, who ruled the fate of wars,
Shot down avenging from the vault of stars.

Then thus aloud: "Ye dauntless Dardans, hear!
And you whom distant nations send to war!
Be mindful of the strength your fathers bore;
Be still yourselves, and Hector asks no more.
One hour demands me in the Trojan wall,
To bid our altars flame, and victims fall:
Nor shall, I trust, the matrons' holy train,
And reverend elders, seek the gods in vain."

This said, with ample strides the hero pass'd;
The shield's large orb behind his shoulder cast,
His neck o'ershading, to his ankle hung;
And as he march'd the brazen buckler rung.

Now paused the battle (godlike Hector gone),(167)
Where daring Glaucus and great Tydeus' son
Between both armies met: the chiefs from far
Observed each other, and had mark'd for war.
Near as they drew, Tydides thus began:

"What art thou, boldest of the race of man?
Our eyes till now that aspect ne'er beheld,
Where fame is reap'd amid the embattled field;
Yet far before the troops thou dar'st appear,
And meet a lance the fiercest heroes fear.
Unhappy they, and born of luckless sires,
Who tempt our fury when Minerva fires!
But if from heaven, celestial, thou descend,
Know with immortals we no more contend.
Not long Lycurgus view'd the golden light,
That daring man who mix'd with gods in fight.
Bacchus, and Bacchus' votaries, he drove,
With brandish'd steel, from Nyssa's sacred grove:
Their consecrated spears lay scatter'd round,
With curling vines and twisted ivy bound;
While Bacchus headlong sought the briny flood,
And Thetis' arms received the trembling god.
Nor fail'd the crime the immortals' wrath to move;
(The immortals bless'd with endless ease above;)
Deprived of sight by their avenging doom,
Cheerless he breathed, and wander'd in the gloom,
Then sunk unpitied to the dire abodes,
A wretch accursed, and hated by the gods!
I brave not heaven: but if the fruits of earth
Sustain thy life, and human be thy birth,
Bold as thou art, too prodigal of breath,
Approach, and enter the dark gates of death."

"What, or from whence I am, or who my sire,
(Replied the chief,) can Tydeus' son inquire?
Like leaves on trees the race of man is found,
Now green in youth, now withering on the ground;
Another race the following spring supplies;
They fall successive, and successive rise:
So generations in their course decay;
So flourish these, when those are pass'd away.
But if thou still persist to search my birth,
Then hear a tale that fills the spacious earth.

"A city stands on Argos' utmost bound,
(Argos the fair, for warlike steeds renown'd,)
Aeolian Sisyphus, with wisdom bless'd,
In ancient time the happy wall possess'd,
Then call'd Ephyre: Glaucus was his son;
Great Glaucus, father of Bellerophon,
Who o'er the sons of men in beauty shined,
Loved for that valour which preserves mankind.
Then mighty Praetus Argos' sceptre sway'd,
Whose hard commands Bellerophon obey'd.
With direful jealousy the monarch raged,
And the brave prince in numerous toils engaged.
For him Antaea burn'd with lawless flame,
And strove to tempt him from the paths of fame:
In vain she tempted the relentless youth,
Endued with wisdom, sacred fear, and truth.
Fired at his scorn the queen to Praetus fled,
And begg'd revenge for her insulted bed:
Incensed he heard, resolving on his fate;
But hospitable laws restrain'd his hate:
To Lycia the devoted youth he sent,
With tablets seal'd, that told his dire intent.(168)
Now bless'd by every power who guards the good,
The chief arrived at Xanthus' silver flood:
There Lycia's monarch paid him honours due,
Nine days he feasted, and nine bulls he slew.
But when the tenth bright morning orient glow'd,
The faithful youth his monarch's mandate show'd:
The fatal tablets, till that instant seal'd,
The deathful secret to the king reveal'd.
First, dire Chimaera's conquest was enjoin'd;
A mingled monster of no mortal kind!
Behind, a dragon's fiery tail was spread;
A goat's rough body bore a lion's head;
Her pitchy nostrils flaky flames expire;
Her gaping throat emits infernal fire.

"This pest he slaughter'd, (for he read the skies,
And trusted heaven's informing prodigies,)
Then met in arms the Solymaean crew,(169)
(Fiercest of men,) and those the warrior slew;
Next the bold Amazons' whole force defied;
And conquer'd still, for heaven was on his side.

"Nor ended here his toils: his Lycian foes,
At his return, a treacherous ambush rose,
With levell'd spears along the winding shore:
There fell they breathless, and return'd no more.

"At length the monarch, with repentant grief,
Confess'd the gods, and god-descended chief;
His daughter gave, the stranger to detain,
With half the honours of his ample reign:
The Lycians grant a chosen space of ground,
With woods, with vineyards, and with harvests crown'd.
There long the chief his happy lot possess'd,
With two brave sons and one fair daughter bless'd;
(Fair e'en in heavenly eyes: her fruitful love
Crown'd with Sarpedon's birth the embrace of Jove;)
But when at last, distracted in his mind,
Forsook by heaven, forsaking humankind,
Wide o'er the Aleian field he chose to stray,
A long, forlorn, uncomfortable way!(170)
Woes heap'd on woes consumed his wasted heart:
His beauteous daughter fell by Phoebe's dart;
His eldest born by raging Mars was slain,
In combat on the Solymaean plain.
Hippolochus survived: from him I came,
The honour'd author of my birth and name;
By his decree I sought the Trojan town;
By his instructions learn to win renown,
To stand the first in worth as in command,
To add new honours to my native land,
Before my eyes my mighty sires to place,
And emulate the glories of our race."

He spoke, and transport fill'd Tydides' heart;
In earth the generous warrior fix'd his dart,
Then friendly, thus the Lycian prince address'd:
"Welcome, my brave hereditary guest!
Thus ever let us meet, with kind embrace,
Nor stain the sacred friendship of our race.
Know, chief, our grandsires have been guests of old;
OEneus the strong, Bellerophon the bold:
Our ancient seat his honour'd presence graced,
Where twenty days in genial rites he pass'd.
The parting heroes mutual presents left;
A golden goblet was thy grandsire's gift;
OEneus a belt of matchless work bestowed,
That rich with Tyrian dye refulgent glow'd.
(This from his pledge I learn'd, which, safely stored
Among my treasures, still adorns my board:
For Tydeus left me young, when Thebe's wall
Beheld the sons of Greece untimely fall.)
Mindful of this, in friendship let us join;
If heaven our steps to foreign lands incline,
My guest in Argos thou, and I in Lycia thine.
Enough of Trojans to this lance shall yield,
In the full harvest of yon ample field;
Enough of Greeks shall dye thy spear with gore;
But thou and Diomed be foes no more.
Now change we arms, and prove to either host
We guard the friendship of the line we boast."

Thus having said, the gallant chiefs alight,
Their hands they join, their mutual faith they plight;
Brave Glaucus then each narrow thought resign'd,
(Jove warm'd his bosom, and enlarged his mind,)
For Diomed's brass arms, of mean device,
For which nine oxen paid, (a vulgar price,)
He gave his own, of gold divinely wrought,(171)
A hundred beeves the shining purchase bought.

Meantime the guardian of the Trojan state,
Great Hector, enter'd at the Scaean gate.(172)
Beneath the beech-tree's consecrated shades,
The Trojan matrons and the Trojan maids
Around him flock'd, all press'd with pious care
For husbands, brothers, sons, engaged in war.
He bids the train in long procession go,
And seek the gods, to avert the impending woe.
And now to Priam's stately courts he came,
Rais'd on arch'd columns of stupendous frame;
O'er these a range of marble structure runs,
The rich pavilions of his fifty sons,
In fifty chambers lodged: and rooms of state,(173)
Opposed to those, where Priam's daughters sate.
Twelve domes for them and their loved spouses shone,
Of equal beauty, and of polish'd stone.
Hither great Hector pass'd, nor pass'd unseen
Of royal Hecuba, his mother-queen.
(With her Laodice, whose beauteous face
Surpass'd the nymphs of Troy's illustrious race.)
Long in a strict embrace she held her son,
And press'd his hand, and tender thus begun:

"O Hector! say, what great occasion calls
My son from fight, when Greece surrounds our walls;
Com'st thou to supplicate the almighty power
With lifted hands, from Ilion's lofty tower?
Stay, till I bring the cup with Bacchus crown'd,
In Jove's high name, to sprinkle on the ground,
And pay due vows to all the gods around.
Then with a plenteous draught refresh thy soul,
And draw new spirits from the generous bowl;
Spent as thou art with long laborious fight,
The brave defender of thy country's right."

"Far hence be Bacchus' gifts; (the chief rejoin'd;)
Inflaming wine, pernicious to mankind,
Unnerves the limbs, and dulls the noble mind.
Let chiefs abstain, and spare the sacred juice
To sprinkle to the gods, its better use.
By me that holy office were profaned;
Ill fits it me, with human gore distain'd,
To the pure skies these horrid hands to raise,
Or offer heaven's great Sire polluted praise.
You, with your matrons, go! a spotless train,
And burn rich odours in Minerva's fane.
The largest mantle your full wardrobes hold,
Most prized for art, and labour'd o'er with gold,
Before the goddess' honour'd knees be spread,
And twelve young heifers to her altar led.
So may the power, atoned by fervent prayer,
Our wives, our infants, and our city spare;
And far avert Tydides' wasteful ire,
Who mows whole troops, and makes all Troy retire.
Be this, O mother, your religious care:
I go to rouse soft Paris to the war;
If yet not lost to all the sense of shame,
The recreant warrior hear the voice of fame.
Oh, would kind earth the hateful wretch embrace,
That pest of Troy, that ruin of our race!(174)
Deep to the dark abyss might he descend,
Troy yet should flourish, and my sorrows end."

This heard, she gave command: and summon'd came
Each noble matron and illustrious dame.
The Phrygian queen to her rich wardrobe went,
Where treasured odours breathed a costly scent.
There lay the vestures of no vulgar art,
Sidonian maids embroider'd every part,
Whom from soft Sidon youthful Paris bore,
With Helen touching on the Tyrian shore.
Here, as the queen revolved with careful eyes
The various textures and the various dyes,
She chose a veil that shone superior far,
And glow'd refulgent as the morning star.
Herself with this the long procession leads;
The train majestically slow proceeds.
Soon as to Ilion's topmost tower they come,
And awful reach the high Palladian dome,
Antenor's consort, fair Theano, waits
As Pallas' priestess, and unbars the gates.
With hands uplifted and imploring eyes,
They fill the dome with supplicating cries.
The priestess then the shining veil displays,
Placed on Minerva's knees, and thus she prays:

"Oh awful goddess! ever-dreadful maid,
Troy's strong defence, unconquer'd Pallas, aid!
Break thou Tydides' spear, and let him fall
Prone on the dust before the Trojan wall!
So twelve young heifers, guiltless of the yoke,
Shall fill thy temple with a grateful smoke.
But thou, atoned by penitence and prayer,
Ourselves, our infants, and our city spare!"
So pray'd the priestess in her holy fane;
So vow'd the matrons, but they vow'd in vain.

While these appear before the power with prayers,
Hector to Paris' lofty dome repairs.(175)
Himself the mansion raised, from every part
Assembling architects of matchless art.
Near Priam's court and Hector's palace stands
The pompous structure, and the town commands.
A spear the hero bore of wondrous strength,
Of full ten cubits was the lance's length,
The steely point with golden ringlets join'd,
Before him brandish'd, at each motion shined
Thus entering, in the glittering rooms he found
His brother-chief, whose useless arms lay round,
His eyes delighting with their splendid show,
Brightening the shield, and polishing the bow.
Beside him Helen with her virgins stands,
Guides their rich labours, and instructs their hands.

Him thus inactive, with an ardent look
The prince beheld, and high-resenting spoke.
"Thy hate to Troy, is this the time to show?
(O wretch ill-fated, and thy country's foe!)
Paris and Greece against us both conspire,
Thy close resentment, and their vengeful ire.
For thee great Ilion's guardian heroes fall,
Till heaps of dead alone defend her wall,
For thee the soldier bleeds, the matron mourns,
And wasteful war in all its fury burns.
Ungrateful man! deserves not this thy care,
Our troops to hearten, and our toils to share?
Rise, or behold the conquering flames ascend,
And all the Phrygian glories at an end."

"Brother, 'tis just, (replied the beauteous youth,)
Thy free remonstrance proves thy worth and truth:
Yet charge my absence less, O generous chief!
On hate to Troy, than conscious shame and grief:
Here, hid from human eyes, thy brother sate,
And mourn'd, in secret, his and Ilion's fate.
'Tis now enough; now glory spreads her charms,
And beauteous Helen calls her chief to arms.
Conquest to-day my happier sword may bless,
'Tis man's to fight, but heaven's to give success.
But while I arm, contain thy ardent mind;
Or go, and Paris shall not lag behind."

                [Illustration: HECTOR CHIDING PARIS.]

                        HECTOR CHIDING PARIS.


He said, nor answer'd Priam's warlike son;
When Helen thus with lowly grace begun:

"Oh, generous brother! (if the guilty dame
That caused these woes deserve a sister's name!)
Would heaven, ere all these dreadful deeds were done,
The day that show'd me to the golden sun
Had seen my death! why did not whirlwinds bear
The fatal infant to the fowls of air?
Why sunk I not beneath the whelming tide,
And midst the roarings of the waters died?
Heaven fill'd up all my ills, and I accursed
Bore all, and Paris of those ills the worst.
Helen at least a braver spouse might claim,
Warm'd with some virtue, some regard of fame!
Now tired with toils, thy fainting limbs recline,
With toils, sustain'd for Paris' sake and mine
The gods have link'd our miserable doom,
Our present woe, and infamy to come:
Wide shall it spread, and last through ages long,
Example sad! and theme of future song."

The chief replied: "This time forbids to rest;
The Trojan bands, by hostile fury press'd,
Demand their Hector, and his arm require;
The combat urges, and my soul's on fire.
Urge thou thy knight to march where glory calls,
And timely join me, ere I leave the walls.
Ere yet I mingle in the direful fray,
My wife, my infant, claim a moment's stay;
This day (perhaps the last that sees me here)
Demands a parting word, a tender tear:
This day, some god who hates our Trojan land
May vanquish Hector by a Grecian hand."

He said, and pass'd with sad presaging heart
To seek his spouse, his soul's far dearer part;
At home he sought her, but he sought in vain;
She, with one maid of all her menial train,
Had hence retired; and with her second joy,
The young Astyanax, the hope of Troy,
Pensive she stood on Ilion's towery height,
Beheld the war, and sicken'd at the sight;
There her sad eyes in vain her lord explore,
Or weep the wounds her bleeding country bore.

But he who found not whom his soul desired,
Whose virtue charm'd him as her beauty fired,
Stood in the gates, and ask'd "what way she bent
Her parting step? If to the fane she went,
Where late the mourning matrons made resort;
Or sought her sisters in the Trojan court?"
"Not to the court, (replied the attendant train,)
Nor mix'd with matrons to Minerva's fane:
To Ilion's steepy tower she bent her way,
To mark the fortunes of the doubtful day.
Troy fled, she heard, before the Grecian sword;
She heard, and trembled for her absent lord:
Distracted with surprise, she seem'd to fly,
Fear on her cheek, and sorrow m her eye.
The nurse attended with her infant boy,
The young Astyanax, the hope of Troy."

Hector this heard, return'd without delay;
Swift through the town he trod his former way,
Through streets of palaces, and walks of state;
And met the mourner at the Scaean gate.
With haste to meet him sprung the joyful fair.
His blameless wife, Aetion's wealthy heir:
(Cilician Thebe great Aetion sway'd,
And Hippoplacus' wide extended shade:)
The nurse stood near, in whose embraces press'd,
His only hope hung smiling at her breast,
Whom each soft charm and early grace adorn,
Fair as the new-born star that gilds the morn.
To this loved infant Hector gave the name
Scamandrius, from Scamander's honour'd stream;
Astyanax the Trojans call'd the boy,
From his great father, the defence of Troy.
Silent the warrior smiled, and pleased resign'd
To tender passions all his mighty mind;
His beauteous princess cast a mournful look,
Hung on his hand, and then dejected spoke;
Her bosom laboured with a boding sigh,
And the big tear stood trembling in her eye.

        [Illustration: THE MEETING OF HECTOR AND ANDROMACHE.]

                THE MEETING OF HECTOR AND ANDROMACHE.


"Too daring prince! ah, whither dost thou run?
Ah, too forgetful of thy wife and son!
And think'st thou not how wretched we shall be,
A widow I, a helpless orphan he?
For sure such courage length of life denies,
And thou must fall, thy virtue's sacrifice.
Greece in her single heroes strove in vain;
Now hosts oppose thee, and thou must be slain.
O grant me, gods, ere Hector meets his doom,
All I can ask of heaven, an early tomb!
So shall my days in one sad tenor run,
And end with sorrows as they first begun.
No parent now remains my griefs to share,
No father's aid, no mother's tender care.
The fierce Achilles wrapt our walls in fire,
Laid Thebe waste, and slew my warlike sire!
His fate compassion in the victor bred;
Stern as he was, he yet revered the dead,
His radiant arms preserved from hostile spoil,
And laid him decent on the funeral pile;
Then raised a mountain where his bones were burn'd,
The mountain-nymphs the rural tomb adorn'd,
Jove's sylvan daughters bade their elms bestow
A barren shade, and in his honour grow.

"By the same arm my seven brave brothers fell;
In one sad day beheld the gates of hell;
While the fat herds and snowy flocks they fed,
Amid their fields the hapless heroes bled!
My mother lived to wear the victor's bands,
The queen of Hippoplacia's sylvan lands:
Redeem'd too late, she scarce beheld again
Her pleasing empire and her native plain,
When ah! oppress'd by life-consuming woe,
She fell a victim to Diana's bow.

"Yet while my Hector still survives, I see
My father, mother, brethren, all, in thee:
Alas! my parents, brothers, kindred, all
Once more will perish, if my Hector fall,
Thy wife, thy infant, in thy danger share:
Oh, prove a husband's and a father's care!
That quarter most the skilful Greeks annoy,
Where yon wild fig-trees join the wall of Troy;
Thou, from this tower defend the important post;
There Agamemnon points his dreadful host,
That pass Tydides, Ajax, strive to gain,
And there the vengeful Spartan fires his train.
Thrice our bold foes the fierce attack have given,
Or led by hopes, or dictated from heaven.
Let others in the field their arms employ,
But stay my Hector here, and guard his Troy."

The chief replied: "That post shall be my care,
Not that alone, but all the works of war.
How would the sons of Troy, in arms renown'd,
And Troy's proud dames, whose garments sweep the ground
Attaint the lustre of my former name,
Should Hector basely quit the field of fame?
My early youth was bred to martial pains,
My soul impels me to the embattled plains!
Let me be foremost to defend the throne,
And guard my father's glories, and my own.

"Yet come it will, the day decreed by fates!
(How my heart trembles while my tongue relates!)
The day when thou, imperial Troy! must bend,
And see thy warriors fall, thy glories end.
And yet no dire presage so wounds my mind,
My mother's death, the ruin of my kind,
Not Priam's hoary hairs defiled with gore,
Not all my brothers gasping on the shore;
As thine, Andromache! Thy griefs I dread:
I see thee trembling, weeping, captive led!
In Argive looms our battles to design,
And woes, of which so large a part was thine!
To bear the victor's hard commands, or bring
The weight of waters from Hyperia's spring.
There while you groan beneath the load of life,
They cry, 'Behold the mighty Hector's wife!'
Some haughty Greek, who lives thy tears to see,
Imbitters all thy woes, by naming me.
The thoughts of glory past, and present shame,
A thousand griefs shall waken at the name!
May I lie cold before that dreadful day,
Press'd with a load of monumental clay!
Thy Hector, wrapt in everlasting sleep,
Shall neither hear thee sigh, nor see thee weep."

Thus having spoke, the illustrious chief of Troy
Stretch'd his fond arms to clasp the lovely boy.
The babe clung crying to his nurse's breast,
Scared at the dazzling helm, and nodding crest.
With secret pleasure each fond parent smiled,
And Hector hasted to relieve his child,
The glittering terrors from his brows unbound,
And placed the beaming helmet on the ground;
Then kiss'd the child, and, lifting high in air,
Thus to the gods preferr'd a father's prayer:

"O thou! whose glory fills the ethereal throne,
And all ye deathless powers! protect my son!
Grant him, like me, to purchase just renown,
To guard the Trojans, to defend the crown,
Against his country's foes the war to wage,
And rise the Hector of the future age!
So when triumphant from successful toils
Of heroes slain he bears the reeking spoils,
Whole hosts may hail him with deserved acclaim,
And say, 'This chief transcends his father's fame:'
While pleased amidst the general shouts of Troy,
His mother's conscious heart o'erflows with joy."

He spoke, and fondly gazing on her charms,
Restored the pleasing burden to her arms;
Soft on her fragrant breast the babe she laid,
Hush'd to repose, and with a smile survey'd.
The troubled pleasure soon chastised by fear,
She mingled with a smile a tender tear.
The soften'd chief with kind compassion view'd,
And dried the falling drops, and thus pursued:

"Andromache! my soul's far better part,
Why with untimely sorrows heaves thy heart?
No hostile hand can antedate my doom,
Till fate condemns me to the silent tomb.
Fix'd is the term to all the race of earth;
And such the hard condition of our birth:
No force can then resist, no flight can save,
All sink alike, the fearful and the brave.
No more--but hasten to thy tasks at home,
There guide the spindle, and direct the loom:
Me glory summons to the martial scene,
The field of combat is the sphere for men.
Where heroes war, the foremost place I claim,
The first in danger as the first in fame."

Thus having said, the glorious chief resumes
His towery helmet, black with shading plumes.
His princess parts with a prophetic sigh,
Unwilling parts, and oft reverts her eye
That stream'd at every look; then, moving slow,
Sought her own palace, and indulged her woe.
There, while her tears deplored the godlike man,
Through all her train the soft infection ran;
The pious maids their mingled sorrows shed,
And mourn the living Hector, as the dead.

But now, no longer deaf to honour's call,
Forth issues Paris from the palace wall.
In brazen arms that cast a gleamy ray,
Swift through the town the warrior bends his way.
The wanton courser thus with reins unbound(176)
Breaks from his stall, and beats the trembling ground;
Pamper'd and proud, he seeks the wonted tides,
And laves, in height of blood his shining sides;
His head now freed, he tosses to the skies;
His mane dishevell'd o'er his shoulders flies;
He snuffs the females in the distant plain,
And springs, exulting, to his fields again.
With equal triumph, sprightly, bold, and gay,
In arms refulgent as the god of day,
The son of Priam, glorying in his might,
Rush'd forth with Hector to the fields of fight.

And now, the warriors passing on the way,
The graceful Paris first excused his stay.
To whom the noble Hector thus replied:
"O chief! in blood, and now in arms, allied!
Thy power in war with justice none contest;
Known is thy courage, and thy strength confess'd.
What pity sloth should seize a soul so brave,
Or godlike Paris live a woman's slave!
My heart weeps blood at what the Trojans say,
And hopes thy deeds shall wipe the stain away.
Haste then, in all their glorious labours share,
For much they suffer, for thy sake, in war.
These ills shall cease, whene'er by Jove's decree
We crown the bowl to heaven and liberty:
While the proud foe his frustrate triumphs mourns,
And Greece indignant through her seas returns."

BOOK VII.


ARGUMENT

THE SINGLE COMBAT OF HECTOR AND AJAX.

The battle renewing with double ardour upon the return of Hector, Minerva
is under apprehensions for the Greeks. Apollo, seeing her descend from
Olympus, joins her near the Scaean gate. They agree to put off the general
engagement for that day, and incite Hector to challenge the Greeks to a
single combat. Nine of the princes accepting the challenge, the lot is
cast and falls upon Ajax. These heroes, after several attacks, are parted
by the night. The Trojans calling a council, Antenor purposes the delivery
of Helen to the Greeks, to which Paris will not consent, but offers to
restore them her riches. Priam sends a herald to make this offer, and to
demand a truce for burning the dead, the last of which only is agreed to
by Agamemnon. When the funerals are performed, the Greeks, pursuant to the
advice of Nestor, erect a fortification to protect their fleet and camp,
flanked with towers, and defended by a ditch and palisades. Neptune
testifies his jealousy at this work, but is pacified by a promise from
Jupiter. Both armies pass the night in feasting but Jupiter disheartens
the Trojans with thunder, and other signs of his wrath.

The three and twentieth day ends with the duel of Hector and Ajax, the
next day the truce is agreed; another is taken up in the funeral rites of
the slain and one more in building the fortification before the ships. So
that somewhat about three days is employed in this book. The scene lies
wholly in the field.

So spoke the guardian of the Trojan state,
Then rush'd impetuous through the Scaean gate.
Him Paris follow'd to the dire alarms;
Both breathing slaughter, both resolved in arms.
As when to sailors labouring through the main,
That long have heaved the weary oar in vain,
Jove bids at length the expected gales arise;
The gales blow grateful, and the vessel flies.
So welcome these to Troy's desiring train,
The bands are cheer'd, the war awakes again.

Bold Paris first the work of death begun
On great Menestheus, Areithous' son,
Sprung from the fair Philomeda's embrace,
The pleasing Arne was his native place.
Then sunk Eioneus to the shades below,
Beneath his steely casque he felt the blow(177)
Full on his neck, from Hector's weighty hand;
And roll'd, with limbs relax'd, along the land.
By Glaucus' spear the bold Iphmous bleeds,
Fix'd in the shoulder as he mounts his steeds;
Headlong he tumbles: his slack nerves unbound,
Drop the cold useless members on the ground.

When now Minerva saw her Argives slain,
From vast Olympus to the gleaming plain
Fierce she descends: Apollo marked her flight,
Nor shot less swift from Ilion's towery height.
Radiant they met, beneath the beechen shade;
When thus Apollo to the blue-eyed maid:

"What cause, O daughter of Almighty Jove!
Thus wings thy progress from the realms above?
Once more impetuous dost thou bend thy way,
To give to Greece the long divided day?
Too much has Troy already felt thy hate,
Now breathe thy rage, and hush the stern debate;
This day, the business of the field suspend;
War soon shall kindle, and great Ilion bend;
Since vengeful goddesses confederate join
To raze her walls, though built by hands divine."

To whom the progeny of Jove replies:
"I left, for this, the council of the skies:
But who shall bid conflicting hosts forbear,
What art shall calm the furious sons of war?"
To her the god: "Great Hector's soul incite
To dare the boldest Greek to single fight,
Till Greece, provoked, from all her numbers show
A warrior worthy to be Hector's foe."

At this agreed, the heavenly powers withdrew;
Sage Helenus their secret counsels knew;
Hector, inspired, he sought: to him address'd,
Thus told the dictates of his sacred breast:
"O son of Priam! let thy faithful ear
Receive my words: thy friend and brother hear!
Go forth persuasive, and a while engage
The warring nations to suspend their rage;
Then dare the boldest of the hostile train
To mortal combat on the listed plain.
For not this day shall end thy glorious date;
The gods have spoke it, and their voice is fate."

He said: the warrior heard the word with joy;
Then with his spear restrain'd the youth of Troy,
Held by the midst athwart. On either hand
The squadrons part; the expecting Trojans stand;
Great Agamemnon bids the Greeks forbear:
They breathe, and hush the tumult of the war.
The Athenian maid, and glorious god of day,(178)
With silent joy the settling hosts survey:
In form of vultures, on the beech's height
They sit conceal'd, and wait the future fight.

The thronging troops obscure the dusky fields,
Horrid with bristling spears, and gleaming shields.
As when a general darkness veils the main,
(Soft Zephyr curling the wide wat'ry plain,)
The waves scarce heave, the face of ocean sleeps,
And a still horror saddens all the deeps;
Thus in thick orders settling wide around,
At length composed they sit, and shade the ground.
Great Hector first amidst both armies broke
The solemn silence, and their powers bespoke:

"Hear, all ye Trojan, all ye Grecian bands,
What my soul prompts, and what some god commands.
Great Jove, averse our warfare to compose,
O'erwhelms the nations with new toils and woes;
War with a fiercer tide once more returns,
Till Ilion falls, or till yon navy burns.
You then, O princes of the Greeks! appear;
'Tis Hector speaks, and calls the gods to hear:
From all your troops select the boldest knight,
And him, the boldest, Hector dares to fight.
Here if I fall, by chance of battle slain,
Be his my spoil, and his these arms remain;
But let my body, to my friends return'd,
By Trojan hands and Trojan flames be burn'd.
And if Apollo, in whose aid I trust,
Shall stretch your daring champion in the dust;
If mine the glory to despoil the foe;
On Phoebus' temple I'll his arms bestow:
The breathless carcase to your navy sent,
Greece on the shore shall raise a monument;
Which when some future mariner surveys,
Wash'd by broad Hellespont's resounding seas,
Thus shall he say, 'A valiant Greek lies there,
By Hector slain, the mighty man of war,'
The stone shall tell your vanquish'd hero's name.
And distant ages learn the victor's fame."

This fierce defiance Greece astonish'd heard,
Blush'd to refuse, and to accept it fear'd.
Stern Menelaus first the silence broke,
And, inly groaning, thus opprobrious spoke:

"Women of Greece! O scandal of your race,
Whose coward souls your manly form disgrace,
How great the shame, when every age shall know
That not a Grecian met this noble foe!
Go then! resolve to earth, from whence ye grew,
A heartless, spiritless, inglorious crew!
Be what ye seem, unanimated clay,
Myself will dare the danger of the day;
'Tis man's bold task the generous strife to try,
But in the hands of God is victory."

These words scarce spoke, with generous ardour press'd,
His manly limbs in azure arms he dress'd.
That day, Atrides! a superior hand
Had stretch'd thee breathless on the hostile strand;
But all at once, thy fury to compose,
The kings of Greece, an awful band, arose;
Even he their chief, great Agamemnon, press'd
Thy daring hand, and this advice address'd:
"Whither, O Menelaus! wouldst thou run,
And tempt a fate which prudence bids thee shun?
Grieved though thou art, forbear the rash design;
Great Hectors arm is mightier far than thine:
Even fierce Achilles learn'd its force to fear,
And trembling met this dreadful son of war.
Sit thou secure, amidst thy social band;
Greece in our cause shall arm some powerful hand.
The mightiest warrior of the Achaian name,
Though bold and burning with desire of fame,
Content the doubtful honour might forego,
So great the danger, and so brave the foe."

He said, and turn'd his brother's vengeful mind;
He stoop'd to reason, and his rage resign'd,
No longer bent to rush on certain harms;
His joyful friends unbrace his azure arms.

He from whose lips divine persuasion flows,
Grave Nestor, then, in graceful act arose;
Thus to the kings he spoke: "What grief, what shame
Attend on Greece, and all the Grecian name!
How shall, alas! her hoary heroes mourn
Their sons degenerate, and their race a scorn!
What tears shall down thy silvery beard be roll'd,
O Peleus, old in arms, in wisdom old!
Once with what joy the generous prince would hear
Of every chief who fought this glorious war,
Participate their fame, and pleased inquire
Each name, each action, and each hero's sire!
Gods! should he see our warriors trembling stand,
And trembling all before one hostile hand;
How would he lift his aged arms on high,
Lament inglorious Greece, and beg to die!
Oh! would to all the immortal powers above,
Minerva, Phoebus, and almighty Jove!
Years might again roll back, my youth renew,
And give this arm the spring which once it knew
When fierce in war, where Jardan's waters fall,
I led my troops to Phea's trembling wall,
And with the Arcadian spears my prowess tried,
Where Celadon rolls down his rapid tide.(179)
There Ereuthalion braved us in the field,
Proud Areithous' dreadful arms to wield;
Great Areithous, known from shore to shore
By the huge, knotted, iron mace he bore;
No lance he shook, nor bent the twanging bow,
But broke, with this, the battle of the foe.
Him not by manly force Lycurgus slew,
Whose guileful javelin from the thicket flew,
Deep in a winding way his breast assailed,
Nor aught the warrior's thundering mace avail'd.
Supine he fell: those arms which Mars before
Had given the vanquish'd, now the victor bore:
But when old age had dimm'd Lycurgus' eyes,
To Ereuthalion he consign'd the prize.
Furious with this he crush'd our levell'd bands,
And dared the trial of the strongest hands;
Nor could the strongest hands his fury stay:
All saw, and fear'd, his huge tempestuous sway
Till I, the youngest of the host, appear'd,
And, youngest, met whom all our army fear'd.
I fought the chief: my arms Minerva crown'd:
Prone fell the giant o'er a length of ground.
What then I was, O were your Nestor now!
Not Hector's self should want an equal foe.
But, warriors, you that youthful vigour boast,
The flower of Greece, the examples of our host,
Sprung from such fathers, who such numbers sway,
Can you stand trembling, and desert the day?"

His warm reproofs the listening kings inflame;
And nine, the noblest of the Grecian name,
Up-started fierce: but far before the rest
The king of men advanced his dauntless breast:
Then bold Tydides, great in arms, appear'd;
And next his bulk gigantic Ajax rear'd;
Oileus follow'd; Idomen was there,(180)
And Merion, dreadful as the god of war:
With these Eurypylus and Thoas stand,
And wise Ulysses closed the daring band.
All these, alike inspired with noble rage,
Demand the fight. To whom the Pylian sage:

"Lest thirst of glory your brave souls divide,
What chief shall combat, let the gods decide.
Whom heaven shall choose, be his the chance to raise
His country's fame, his own immortal praise."

The lots produced, each hero signs his own:
Then in the general's helm the fates are thrown,(181)
The people pray, with lifted eyes and hands,
And vows like these ascend from all the bands:
"Grant, thou Almighty! in whose hand is fate,
A worthy champion for the Grecian state:
This task let Ajax or Tydides prove,
Or he, the king of kings, beloved by Jove."
Old Nestor shook the casque. By heaven inspired,
Leap'd forth the lot, of every Greek desired.
This from the right to left the herald bears,
Held out in order to the Grecian peers;
Each to his rival yields the mark unknown,
Till godlike Ajax finds the lot his own;
Surveys the inscription with rejoicing eyes,
Then casts before him, and with transport cries:

"Warriors! I claim the lot, and arm with joy;
Be mine the conquest of this chief of Troy.
Now while my brightest arms my limbs invest,
To Saturn's son be all your vows address'd:
But pray in secret, lest the foes should hear,
And deem your prayers the mean effect of fear.
Said I in secret? No, your vows declare
In such a voice as fills the earth and air,
Lives there a chief whom Ajax ought to dread?
Ajax, in all the toils of battle bred!
From warlike Salamis I drew my birth,
And, born to combats, fear no force on earth."

He said. The troops with elevated eyes,
Implore the god whose thunder rends the skies:
"O father of mankind, superior lord!
On lofty Ida's holy hill adored:
Who in the highest heaven hast fix'd thy throne,
Supreme of gods! unbounded and alone:
Grant thou, that Telamon may bear away
The praise and conquest of this doubtful day;
Or, if illustrious Hector be thy care,
That both may claim it, and that both may share."

Now Ajax braced his dazzling armour on;
Sheathed in bright steel the giant-warrior shone:
He moves to combat with majestic pace;
So stalks in arms the grisly god of Thrace,(182)
When Jove to punish faithless men prepares,
And gives whole nations to the waste of wars,
Thus march'd the chief, tremendous as a god;
Grimly he smiled; earth trembled as he strode:(183)
His massy javelin quivering in his hand,
He stood, the bulwark of the Grecian band.
Through every Argive heart new transport ran;
All Troy stood trembling at the mighty man:
Even Hector paused; and with new doubt oppress'd,
Felt his great heart suspended in his breast:
'Twas vain to seek retreat, and vain to fear;
Himself had challenged, and the foe drew near.

Stern Telamon behind his ample shield,
As from a brazen tower, o'erlook'd the field.
Huge was its orb, with seven thick folds o'ercast,
Of tough bull-hides; of solid brass the last,
(The work of Tychius, who in Hyle dwell'd
And in all arts of armoury excell'd,)
This Ajax bore before his manly breast,
And, threatening, thus his adverse chief address'd:

"Hector! approach my arm, and singly know
What strength thou hast, and what the Grecian foe.
Achilles shuns the fight; yet some there are,
Not void of soul, and not unskill'd in war:
Let him, unactive on the sea-beat shore,
Indulge his wrath, and aid our arms no more;
Whole troops of heroes Greece has yet to boast,
And sends thee one, a sample of her host,
Such as I am, I come to prove thy might;
No more--be sudden, and begin the fight."

"O son of Telamon, thy country's pride!
(To Ajax thus the Trojan prince replied)
Me, as a boy, or woman, wouldst thou fright,
New to the field, and trembling at the fight?
Thou meet'st a chief deserving of thy arms,
To combat born, and bred amidst alarms:
I know to shift my ground, remount the car,
Turn, charge, and answer every call of war;
To right, to left, the dexterous lance I wield,
And bear thick battle on my sounding shield
But open be our fight, and bold each blow;
I steal no conquest from a noble foe."

He said, and rising, high above the field
Whirl'd the long lance against the sevenfold shield.
Full on the brass descending from above
Through six bull-hides the furious weapon drove,
Till in the seventh it fix'd. Then Ajax threw;
Through Hector's shield the forceful javelin flew,
His corslet enters, and his garment rends,
And glancing downwards, near his flank descends.
The wary Trojan shrinks, and bending low
Beneath his buckler, disappoints the blow.
From their bored shields the chiefs their javelins drew,
Then close impetuous, and the charge renew;
Fierce as the mountain-lions bathed in blood,
Or foaming boars, the terror of the wood.
At Ajax, Hector his long lance extends;
The blunted point against the buckler bends;
But Ajax, watchful as his foe drew near,
Drove through the Trojan targe the knotty spear;
It reach'd his neck, with matchless strength impell'd!
Spouts the black gore, and dims his shining shield.
Yet ceased not Hector thus; but stooping down,
In his strong hand up-heaved a flinty stone,
Black, craggy, vast: to this his force he bends;
Full on the brazen boss the stone descends;
The hollow brass resounded with the shock:
Then Ajax seized the fragment of a rock,
Applied each nerve, and swinging round on high,
With force tempestuous, let the ruin fly;
The huge stone thundering through his buckler broke:
His slacken'd knees received the numbing stroke;
Great Hector falls extended on the field,
His bulk supporting on the shatter'd shield:
Nor wanted heavenly aid: Apollo's might
Confirm'd his sinews, and restored to fight.
And now both heroes their broad falchions drew
In flaming circles round their heads they flew;
But then by heralds' voice the word was given.
The sacred ministers of earth and heaven:
Divine Talthybius, whom the Greeks employ.
And sage Idaeus on the part of Troy,
Between the swords their peaceful sceptres rear'd;
And first Idaeus' awful voice was heard:

      [Illustration: HECTOR AND AJAX SEPARATED BY THE HERALDS.]

              HECTOR AND AJAX SEPARATED BY THE HERALDS.


"Forbear, my sons! your further force to prove,
Both dear to men, and both beloved of Jove.
To either host your matchless worth is known,
Each sounds your praise, and war is all your own.
But now the Night extends her awful shade;
The goddess parts you; be the night obey'd."(184)

To whom great Ajax his high soul express'd:
"O sage! to Hector be these words address'd.
Let him, who first provoked our chiefs to fight,
Let him demand the sanction of the night;
If first he ask'd it, I content obey,
And cease the strife when Hector shows the way."

"O first of Greeks! (his noble foe rejoin'd)
Whom heaven adorns, superior to thy kind,
With strength of body, and with worth of mind!
Now martial law commands us to forbear;
Hereafter we shall meet in glorious war,
Some future day shall lengthen out the strife,
And let the gods decide of death or life!
Since, then, the night extends her gloomy shade,
And heaven enjoins it, be the night obey'd.
Return, brave Ajax, to thy Grecian friends,
And joy the nations whom thy arm defends;
As I shall glad each chief, and Trojan wife,
Who wearies heaven with vows for Hector's life.
But let us, on this memorable day,
Exchange some gift: that Greece and Troy may say,
'Not hate, but glory, made these chiefs contend;
And each brave foe was in his soul a friend.'"

With that, a sword with stars of silver graced,
The baldric studded, and the sheath enchased,
He gave the Greek. The generous Greek bestow'd
A radiant belt that rich with purple glow'd.
Then with majestic grace they quit the plain;
This seeks the Grecian, that the Phrygian train.

The Trojan bands returning Hector wait,
And hail with joy the Champion of their state;
Escaped great Ajax, they survey him round,
Alive, unarm'd, and vigorous from his wound;
To Troy's high gates the godlike man they bear
Their present triumph, as their late despair.

But Ajax, glorying in his hardy deed,
The well-arm'd Greeks to Agamemnon lead.
A steer for sacrifice the king design'd,
Of full five years, and of the nobler kind.
The victim falls; they strip the smoking hide,
The beast they quarter, and the joints divide;
Then spread the tables, the repast prepare,
Each takes his seat, and each receives his share.
The king himself (an honorary sign)
Before great Ajax placed the mighty chine.(185)
When now the rage of hunger was removed,
Nestor, in each persuasive art approved,
The sage whose counsels long had sway'd the rest,
In words like these his prudent thought express'd:

"How dear, O kings! this fatal day has cost,
What Greeks are perish'd! what a people lost!
What tides of blood have drench'd Scamander's shore!
What crowds of heroes sunk to rise no more!
Then hear me, chief! nor let the morrow's light
Awake thy squadrons to new toils of fight:
Some space at least permit the war to breathe,
While we to flames our slaughter'd friends bequeath,
From the red field their scatter'd bodies bear,
And nigh the fleet a funeral structure rear;
So decent urns their snowy bones may keep,
And pious children o'er their ashes weep.
Here, where on one promiscuous pile they blazed,
High o'er them all a general tomb be raised;
Next, to secure our camp and naval powers,
Raise an embattled wall, with lofty towers;
From space to space be ample gates around,
For passing chariots; and a trench profound.
So Greece to combat shall in safety go,
Nor fear the fierce incursions of the foe."
'Twas thus the sage his wholesome counsel moved;
The sceptred kings of Greece his words approved.

Meanwhile, convened at Priam's palace-gate,
The Trojan peers in nightly council sate;
A senate void of order, as of choice:
Their hearts were fearful, and confused their voice.
Antenor, rising, thus demands their ear:
"Ye Trojans, Dardans, and auxiliars, hear!
'Tis heaven the counsel of my breast inspires,
And I but move what every god requires:
Let Sparta's treasures be this hour restored,
And Argive Helen own her ancient lord.
The ties of faith, the sworn alliance, broke,
Our impious battles the just gods provoke.
As this advice ye practise, or reject,
So hope success, or dread the dire effect."

The senior spoke and sate. To whom replied
The graceful husband of the Spartan bride:
"Cold counsels, Trojan, may become thy years
But sound ungrateful in a warrior's ears:
Old man, if void of fallacy or art,
Thy words express the purpose of thy heart,
Thou, in thy time, more sound advice hast given;
But wisdom has its date, assign'd by heaven.
Then hear me, princes of the Trojan name!
Their treasures I'll restore, but not the dame;
My treasures too, for peace, I will resign;
But be this bright possession ever mine."

'Twas then, the growing discord to compose,
Slow from his seat the reverend Priam rose:
His godlike aspect deep attention drew:
He paused, and these pacific words ensue:

"Ye Trojans, Dardans, and auxiliar bands!
Now take refreshment as the hour demands;
Guard well the walls, relieve the watch of night.
Till the new sun restores the cheerful light.
Then shall our herald, to the Atrides sent,
Before their ships proclaim my son's intent.
Next let a truce be ask'd, that Troy may burn
Her slaughter'd heroes, and their bones inurn;
That done, once more the fate of war be tried,
And whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide!"

The monarch spoke: the warriors snatch'd with haste
(Each at his post in arms) a short repast.
Soon as the rosy morn had waked the day,
To the black ships Idaeus bent his way;
There, to the sons of Mars, in council found,
He raised his voice: the host stood listening round.

"Ye sons of Atreus, and ye Greeks, give ear!
The words of Troy, and Troy's great monarch, hear.
Pleased may ye hear (so heaven succeed my prayers)
What Paris, author of the war, declares.
The spoils and treasures he to Ilion bore
(Oh had he perish'd ere they touch'd our shore!)
He proffers injured Greece: with large increase
Of added Trojan wealth to buy the peace.
But to restore the beauteous bride again,
This Greece demands, and Troy requests in vain.
Next, O ye chiefs! we ask a truce to burn
Our slaughter'd heroes, and their bones inurn.
That done, once more the fate of war be tried,
And whose the conquest, mighty Jove decide!"

The Greeks gave ear, but none the silence broke;
At length Tydides rose, and rising spoke:
"Oh, take not, friends! defrauded of your fame,
Their proffer'd wealth, nor even the Spartan dame.
Let conquest make them ours: fate shakes their wall,
And Troy already totters to her fall."

The admiring chiefs, and all the Grecian name,
With general shouts return'd him loud acclaim.
Then thus the king of kings rejects the peace:
"Herald! in him thou hear'st the voice of Greece
For what remains; let funeral flames be fed
With heroes' corps: I war not with the dead:
Go search your slaughtered chiefs on yonder plain,
And gratify the manes of the slain.
Be witness, Jove, whose thunder rolls on high!"
He said, and rear'd his sceptre to the sky.

To sacred Troy, where all her princes lay
To wait the event, the herald bent his way.
He came, and standing in the midst, explain'd
The peace rejected, but the truce obtain'd.
Straight to their several cares the Trojans move,
Some search the plains, some fell the sounding grove:
Nor less the Greeks, descending on the shore,
Hew'd the green forests, and the bodies bore.
And now from forth the chambers of the main,
To shed his sacred light on earth again,
Arose the golden chariot of the day,
And tipp'd the mountains with a purple ray.
In mingled throngs the Greek and Trojan train
Through heaps of carnage search'd the mournful plain.
Scarce could the friend his slaughter'd friend explore,
With dust dishonour'd, and deformed with gore.
The wounds they wash'd, their pious tears they shed,
And, laid along their cars, deplored the dead.
Sage Priam check'd their grief: with silent haste
The bodies decent on the piles were placed:
With melting hearts the cold remains they burn'd,
And, sadly slow, to sacred Troy return'd.
Nor less the Greeks their pious sorrows shed,
And decent on the pile dispose the dead;
The cold remains consume with equal care;
And slowly, sadly, to their fleet repair.
Now, ere the morn had streak'd with reddening light
The doubtful confines of the day and night,
About the dying flames the Greeks appear'd,
And round the pile a general tomb they rear'd.
Then, to secure the camp and naval powers,
They raised embattled walls with lofty towers:(186)
From space to space were ample gates around,
For passing chariots, and a trench profound
Of large extent; and deep in earth below,
Strong piles infix'd stood adverse to the foe.

So toil'd the Greeks: meanwhile the gods above,
In shining circle round their father Jove,
Amazed beheld the wondrous works of man:
Then he, whose trident shakes the earth, began:

"What mortals henceforth shall our power adore,
Our fanes frequent, our oracles implore,
If the proud Grecians thus successful boast
Their rising bulwarks on the sea-beat coast?
See the long walls extending to the main,
No god consulted, and no victim slain!
Their fame shall fill the world's remotest ends,
Wide as the morn her golden beam extends;
While old Laomedon's divine abodes,
Those radiant structures raised by labouring gods,
Shall, razed and lost, in long oblivion sleep."
Thus spoke the hoary monarch of the deep.

The almighty Thunderer with a frown replies,
That clouds the world, and blackens half the skies:
"Strong god of ocean! thou, whose rage can make
The solid earth's eternal basis shake!
What cause of fear from mortal works could move(187)
The meanest subject of our realms above?
Where'er the sun's refulgent rays are cast,
Thy power is honour'd, and thy fame shall last.
But yon proud work no future age shall view,
No trace remain where once the glory grew.
The sapp'd foundations by thy force shall fall,
And, whelm'd beneath the waves, drop the huge wall:
Vast drifts of sand shall change the former shore:
The ruin vanish'd, and the name no more."

Thus they in heaven: while, o'er the Grecian train,
The rolling sun descending to the main
Beheld the finish'd work. Their bulls they slew;
Back from the tents the savoury vapour flew.
And now the fleet, arrived from Lemnos' strands,
With Bacchus' blessings cheered the generous bands.
Of fragrant wines the rich Eunaeus sent
A thousant measures to the royal tent.
(Eunaeus, whom Hypsipyle of yore
To Jason, shepherd of his people, bore,)
The rest they purchased at their proper cost,
And well the plenteous freight supplied the host:
Each, in exchange, proportion'd treasures gave;(188)
Some, brass or iron; some, an ox, or slave.
All night they feast, the Greek and Trojan powers:
Those on the fields, and these within their towers.
But Jove averse the signs of wrath display'd,
And shot red lightnings through the gloomy shade:
Humbled they stood; pale horror seized on all,
While the deep thunder shook the aerial hall.
Each pour'd to Jove before the bowl was crown'd;
And large libations drench'd the thirsty ground:
Then late, refresh'd with sleep from toils of fight,
Enjoy'd the balmy blessings of the night.

BOOK VIII.


ARGUMENT.

THE SECOND BATTLE, AND THE DISTRESS OF THE GREEKS.

Jupiter assembles a council of the deities, and threatens them with the
pains of Tartarus if they assist either side: Minerva only obtains of him
that she may direct the Greeks by her counsels.(189) his balances the
fates of both, and affrights the Greeks with his thunders and lightnings.
Nestor alone continues in the field in great danger: Diomed relieves him;
whose exploits, and those of Hector, are excellently described. Juno
endeavours to animate Neptune to the assistance of the Greeks, but in
vain. The acts of Teucer, who is at length wounded by Hector, and carried
off. Juno and Minerva prepare to aid the Grecians, but are restrained by
Iris, sent from Jupiter. The night puts an end to the battle. Hector
continues in the field, (the Greeks being driven to their fortifications
before the ships,) and gives orders to keep the watch all night in the
camp, to prevent the enemy from re-embarking and escaping by flight. They
kindle fires through all the fields, and pass the night under arms.

The time of seven and twenty days is employed from the opening of the poem
to the end of this book. The scene here (except of the celestial machines)
lies in the field towards the seashore.

Aurora now, fair daughter of the dawn,
Sprinkled with rosy light the dewy lawn;
When Jove convened the senate of the skies,
Where high Olympus' cloudy tops arise,
The sire of gods his awful silence broke;
The heavens attentive trembled as he spoke:

"Celestial states! immortal gods! give ear,
Hear our decree, and reverence what ye hear;
The fix'd decree which not all heaven can move;
Thou, fate! fulfil it! and, ye powers, approve!
What god but enters yon forbidden field,
Who yields assistance, or but wills to yield,
Back to the skies with shame he shall be driven,
Gash'd with dishonest wounds, the scorn of heaven;
Or far, oh far, from steep Olympus thrown,
Low in the dark Tartarean gulf shall groan,
With burning chains fix'd to the brazen floors,
And lock'd by hell's inexorable doors;
As deep beneath the infernal centre hurl'd,(190)
As from that centre to the ethereal world.
Let him who tempts me, dread those dire abodes:
And know, the Almighty is the god of gods.
League all your forces, then, ye powers above,
Join all, and try the omnipotence of Jove.
Let down our golden everlasting chain(191)
Whose strong embrace holds heaven, and earth, and main
Strive all, of mortal and immortal birth,
To drag, by this, the Thunderer down to earth
Ye strive in vain! if I but stretch this hand,
I heave the gods, the ocean, and the land;
I fix the chain to great Olympus' height,
And the vast world hangs trembling in my sight!
For such I reign, unbounded and above;
And such are men, and gods, compared to Jove."

The all-mighty spoke, nor durst the powers reply:
A reverend horror silenced all the sky;
Trembling they stood before their sovereign's look;
At length his best-beloved, the power of wisdom, spoke:

"O first and greatest! God, by gods adored
We own thy might, our father and our lord!
But, ah! permit to pity human state:
If not to help, at least lament their fate.
From fields forbidden we submiss refrain,
With arms unaiding mourn our Argives slain;
Yet grant my counsels still their breasts may move,
Or all must perish in the wrath of Jove."

The cloud-compelling god her suit approved,
And smiled superior on his best beloved;
Then call'd his coursers, and his chariot took;
The stedfast firmament beneath them shook:
Rapt by the ethereal steeds the chariot roll'd;
Brass were their hoofs, their curling manes of gold:
Of heaven's undrossy gold the gods array,
Refulgent, flash'd intolerable day.
High on the throne he shines: his coursers fly
Between the extended earth and starry sky.
But when to Ida's topmost height he came,
(Fair nurse of fountains, and of savage game,)
Where o'er her pointed summits proudly raised,
His fane breathed odours, and his altar blazed:
There, from his radiant car, the sacred sire
Of gods and men released the steeds of fire:
Blue ambient mists the immortal steeds embraced;
High on the cloudy point his seat he placed;
Thence his broad eye the subject world surveys,
The town, and tents, and navigable seas.

Now had the Grecians snatch'd a short repast,
And buckled on their shining arms with haste.
Troy roused as soon; for on this dreadful day
The fate of fathers, wives, and infants lay.
The gates unfolding pour forth all their train;
Squadrons on squadrons cloud the dusky plain:
Men, steeds, and chariots shake the trembling ground,
The tumult thickens, and the skies resound;
And now with shouts the shocking armies closed,
To lances lances, shields to shields opposed,
Host against host with shadowy legends drew,
The sounding darts in iron tempests flew;
Victors and vanquish'd join promiscuous cries,
Triumphant shouts and dying groans arise;
With streaming blood the slippery fields are dyed,
And slaughter'd heroes swell the dreadful tide.
Long as the morning beams, increasing bright,
O'er heaven's clear azure spread the sacred light,
Commutual death the fate of war confounds,
Each adverse battle gored with equal wounds.
But when the sun the height of heaven ascends,
The sire of gods his golden scales suspends,(192)
With equal hand: in these explored the fate
Of Greece and Troy, and poised the mighty weight:
Press'd with its load, the Grecian balance lies
Low sunk on earth, the Trojan strikes the skies.
Then Jove from Ida's top his horrors spreads;
The clouds burst dreadful o'er the Grecian heads;
Thick lightnings flash; the muttering thunder rolls;
Their strength he withers, and unmans their souls.
Before his wrath the trembling hosts retire;
The gods in terrors, and the skies on fire.
Nor great Idomeneus that sight could bear,
Nor each stern Ajax, thunderbolts of war:
Nor he, the king of war, the alarm sustain'd
Nestor alone, amidst the storm remain'd.
Unwilling he remain'd, for Paris' dart
Had pierced his courser in a mortal part;
Fix'd in the forehead, where the springing man
Curl'd o'er the brow, it stung him to the brain;
Mad with his anguish, he begins to rear,
Paw with his hoofs aloft, and lash the air.
Scarce had his falchion cut the reins, and freed
The encumber'd chariot from the dying steed,
When dreadful Hector, thundering through the war,
Pour'd to the tumult on his whirling car.
That day had stretch'd beneath his matchless hand
The hoary monarch of the Pylian band,
But Diomed beheld; from forth the crowd
He rush'd, and on Ulysses call'd aloud:

"Whither, oh whither does Ulysses run?
Oh, flight unworthy great Laertes' son!
Mix'd with the vulgar shall thy fate be found,
Pierced in the back, a vile, dishonest wound?
Oh turn and save from Hector's direful rage
The glory of the Greeks, the Pylian sage."
His fruitless words are lost unheard in air,
Ulysses seeks the ships, and shelters there.
But bold Tydides to the rescue goes,
A single warrior midst a host of foes;
Before the coursers with a sudden spring
He leap'd, and anxious thus bespoke the king:

"Great perils, father! wait the unequal fight;
These younger champions will oppress thy might.
Thy veins no more with ancient vigour glow,
Weak is thy servant, and thy coursers slow.
Then haste, ascend my seat, and from the car
Observe the steeds of Tros, renown'd in war.
Practised alike to turn, to stop, to chase,
To dare the fight, or urge the rapid race:
These late obey'd Ćneas' guiding rein;
Leave thou thy chariot to our faithful train;
With these against yon Trojans will we go,
Nor shall great Hector want an equal foe;
Fierce as he is, even he may learn to fear
The thirsty fury of my flying spear."

Thus said the chief; and Nestor, skill'd in war,
Approves his counsel, and ascends the car:
The steeds he left, their trusty servants hold;
Eurymedon, and Sthenelus the bold:
The reverend charioteer directs the course,
And strains his aged arm to lash the horse.
Hector they face; unknowing how to fear,
Fierce he drove on; Tydides whirl'd his spear.
The spear with erring haste mistook its way,
But plunged in Eniopeus' bosom lay.
His opening hand in death forsakes the rein;
The steeds fly back: he falls, and spurns the plain.
Great Hector sorrows for his servant kill'd,
Yet unrevenged permits to press the field;
Till, to supply his place and rule the car,
Rose Archeptolemus, the fierce in war.
And now had death and horror cover'd all;(193)
Like timorous flocks the Trojans in their wall
Inclosed had bled: but Jove with awful sound
Roll'd the big thunder o'er the vast profound:
Full in Tydides' face the lightning flew;
The ground before him flamed with sulphur blue;
The quivering steeds fell prostrate at the sight;
And Nestor's trembling hand confess'd his fright:
He dropp'd the reins: and, shook with sacred dread,
Thus, turning, warn'd the intrepid Diomed:

"O chief! too daring in thy friend's defence
Retire advised, and urge the chariot hence.
This day, averse, the sovereign of the skies
Assists great Hector, and our palm denies.
Some other sun may see the happier hour,
When Greece shall conquer by his heavenly power.
'Tis not in man his fix'd decree to move:
The great will glory to submit to Jove."

"O reverend prince! (Tydides thus replies)
Thy years are awful, and thy words are wise.
But ah, what grief! should haughty Hector boast
I fled inglorious to the guarded coast.
Before that dire disgrace shall blast my fame,
O'erwhelm me, earth; and hide a warrior's shame!"
To whom Gerenian Nestor thus replied:(194)
"Gods! can thy courage fear the Phrygian's pride?
Hector may vaunt, but who shall heed the boast?
Not those who felt thy arm, the Dardan host,
Nor Troy, yet bleeding in her heroes lost;
Not even a Phrygian dame, who dreads the sword
That laid in dust her loved, lamented lord."
He said, and, hasty, o'er the gasping throng
Drives the swift steeds: the chariot smokes along;
The shouts of Trojans thicken in the wind;
The storm of hissing javelins pours behind.
Then with a voice that shakes the solid skies,
Pleased, Hector braves the warrior as he flies.
"Go, mighty hero! graced above the rest
In seats of council and the sumptuous feast:
Now hope no more those honours from thy train;
Go less than woman, in the form of man!
To scale our walls, to wrap our towers in flames,
To lead in exile the fair Phrygian dames,
Thy once proud hopes, presumptuous prince! are fled;
This arm shall reach thy heart, and stretch thee dead."

Now fears dissuade him, and now hopes invite.
To stop his coursers, and to stand the fight;
Thrice turn'd the chief, and thrice imperial Jove
On Ida's summits thunder'd from above.
Great Hector heard; he saw the flashing light,
(The sign of conquest,) and thus urged the fight:

"Hear, every Trojan, Lycian, Dardan band,
All famed in war, and dreadful hand to hand.
Be mindful of the wreaths your arms have won,
Your great forefathers' glories, and your own.
Heard ye the voice of Jove? Success and fame
Await on Troy, on Greece eternal shame.
In vain they skulk behind their boasted wall,
Weak bulwarks; destined by this arm to fall.
High o'er their slighted trench our steeds shall bound,
And pass victorious o'er the levell'd mound.
Soon as before yon hollow ships we stand,
Fight each with flames, and toss the blazing brand;
Till, their proud navy wrapt in smoke and fires,
All Greece, encompass'd, in one blaze expires."

Furious he said; then bending o'er the yoke,
Encouraged his proud steeds, while thus he spoke:

"Now, Xanthus, Ćthon, Lampus, urge the chase,
And thou, Podargus! prove thy generous race;
Be fleet, be fearless, this important day,
And all your master's well-spent care repay.
For this, high-fed, in plenteous stalls ye stand,
Served with pure wheat, and by a princess' hand;
For this my spouse, of great Aetion's line,
So oft has steep'd the strengthening grain in wine.
Now swift pursue, now thunder uncontroll'd:
Give me to seize rich Nestor's shield of gold;
From Tydeus' shoulders strip the costly load,
Vulcanian arms, the labour of a god:
These if we gain, then victory, ye powers!
This night, this glorious night, the fleet is ours!"

That heard, deep anguish stung Saturnia's soul;
She shook her throne, that shook the starry pole:
And thus to Neptune: "Thou, whose force can make
The stedfast earth from her foundations shake,
Seest thou the Greeks by fates unjust oppress'd,
Nor swells thy heart in that immortal breast?
Yet Ćgae, Helice, thy power obey,(195)
And gifts unceasing on thine altars lay.
Would all the deities of Greece combine,
In vain the gloomy Thunderer might repine:
Sole should he sit, with scarce a god to friend,
And see his Trojans to the shades descend:
Such be the scene from his Idaean bower;
Ungrateful prospect to the sullen power!"

Neptune with wrath rejects the rash design:
"What rage, what madness, furious queen! is thine?
I war not with the highest. All above
Submit and tremble at the hand of Jove."

Now godlike Hector, to whose matchless might
Jove gave the glory of the destined fight,
Squadrons on squadrons drives, and fills the fields
With close-ranged chariots, and with thicken'd shields.
Where the deep trench in length extended lay,
Compacted troops stand wedged in firm array,
A dreadful front! they shake the brands, and threat
With long-destroying flames the hostile fleet.
The king of men, by Juno's self inspired,
Toil'd through the tents, and all his army fired.
Swift as he moved, he lifted in his hand
His purple robe, bright ensign of command.
High on the midmost bark the king appear'd:
There, from Ulysses' deck, his voice was heard:
To Ajax and Achilles reach'd the sound,
Whose distant ships the guarded navy bound.
"O Argives! shame of human race! (he cried:
The hollow vessels to his voice replied,)
Where now are all your glorious boasts of yore,
Your hasty triumphs on the Lemnian shore?
Each fearless hero dares a hundred foes,
While the feast lasts, and while the goblet flows;
But who to meet one martial man is found,
When the fight rages, and the flames surround?
O mighty Jove! O sire of the distress'd!
Was ever king like me, like me oppress'd?
With power immense, with justice arm'd in vain;
My glory ravish'd, and my people slain!
To thee my vows were breathed from every shore;
What altar smoked not with our victims' gore?
With fat of bulls I fed the constant flame,
And ask'd destruction to the Trojan name.
Now, gracious god! far humbler our demand;
Give these at least to 'scape from Hector's hand,
And save the relics of the Grecian land!"

Thus pray'd the king, and heaven's great father heard
His vows, in bitterness of soul preferr'd:
The wrath appeased, by happy signs declares,
And gives the people to their monarch's prayers.
His eagle, sacred bird of heaven! he sent,
A fawn his talons truss'd, (divine portent!)
High o'er the wondering hosts he soar'd above,
Who paid their vows to Panomphaean Jove;
Then let the prey before his altar fall;
The Greeks beheld, and transport seized on all:
Encouraged by the sign, the troops revive,
And fierce on Troy with doubled fury drive.
Tydides first, of all the Grecian force,
O'er the broad ditch impell'd his foaming horse,
Pierced the deep ranks, their strongest battle tore,
And dyed his javelin red with Trojan gore.
Young Agelaus (Phradmon was his sire)
With flying coursers shunn'd his dreadful ire;
Struck through the back, the Phrygian fell oppress'd;
The dart drove on, and issued at his breast:
Headlong he quits the car: his arms resound;
His ponderous buckler thunders on the ground.
Forth rush a tide of Greeks, the passage freed;
The Atridae first, the Ajaces next succeed:
Meriones, like Mars in arms renown'd,
And godlike Idomen, now passed the mound;
Evaemon's son next issues to the foe,
And last young Teucer with his bended bow.
Secure behind the Telamonian shield
The skilful archer wide survey'd the field,
With every shaft some hostile victim slew,
Then close beneath the sevenfold orb withdrew:
The conscious infant so, when fear alarms,
Retires for safety to the mother's arms.
Thus Ajax guards his brother in the field,
Moves as he moves, and turns the shining shield.
Who first by Teucer's mortal arrows bled?
Orsilochus; then fell Ormenus dead:
The godlike Lycophon next press'd the plain,
With Chromius, Daetor, Ophelestes slain:
Bold Hamopaon breathless sunk to ground;
The bloody pile great Melanippus crown'd.
Heaps fell on heaps, sad trophies of his art,
A Trojan ghost attending every dart.
Great Agamemnon views with joyful eye
The ranks grow thinner as his arrows fly:
"O youth forever dear! (the monarch cried)
Thus, always thus, thy early worth be tried;
Thy brave example shall retrieve our host,
Thy country's saviour, and thy father's boast!
Sprung from an alien's bed thy sire to grace,
The vigorous offspring of a stolen embrace:
Proud of his boy, he own'd the generous flame,
And the brave son repays his cares with fame.
Now hear a monarch's vow: If heaven's high powers
Give me to raze Troy's long-defended towers;
Whatever treasures Greece for me design,
The next rich honorary gift be thine:
Some golden tripod, or distinguished car,
With coursers dreadful in the ranks of war:
Or some fair captive, whom thy eyes approve,
Shall recompense the warrior's toils with love."

To this the chief: "With praise the rest inspire,
Nor urge a soul already fill'd with fire.
What strength I have, be now in battle tried,
Till every shaft in Phrygian blood be dyed.
Since rallying from our wall we forced the foe,
Still aim'd at Hector have I bent my bow:
Eight forky arrows from this hand have fled,
And eight bold heroes by their points lie dead:
But sure some god denies me to destroy
This fury of the field, this dog of Troy."

He said, and twang'd the string. The weapon flies
At Hector's breast, and sings along the skies:
He miss'd the mark; but pierced Gorgythio's heart,
And drench'd in royal blood the thirsty dart.
(Fair Castianira, nymph of form divine,
This offspring added to king Priam's line.)
As full-blown poppies, overcharged with rain,(196)
Decline the head, and drooping kiss the plain;
So sinks the youth: his beauteous head, depress'd
Beneath his helmet, drops upon his breast.
Another shaft the raging archer drew,
That other shaft with erring fury flew,
(From Hector, Phoebus turn'd the flying wound,)
Yet fell not dry or guiltless to the ground:
Thy breast, brave Archeptolemus! it tore,
And dipp'd its feathers in no vulgar gore.
Headlong he falls: his sudden fall alarms
The steeds, that startle at his sounding arms.
Hector with grief his charioteer beheld
All pale and breathless on the sanguine field:
Then bids Cebriones direct the rein,
Quits his bright car, and issues on the plain.
Dreadful he shouts: from earth a stone he took,
And rush'd on Teucer with the lifted rock.
The youth already strain'd the forceful yew;
The shaft already to his shoulder drew;
The feather in his hand, just wing'd for flight,
Touch'd where the neck and hollow chest unite;
There, where the juncture knits the channel bone,
The furious chief discharged the craggy stone:
The bow-string burst beneath the ponderous blow,
And his numb'd hand dismiss'd his useless bow.
He fell: but Ajax his broad shield display'd,
And screen'd his brother with the mighty shade;
Till great Alaster, and Mecistheus, bore
The batter'd archer groaning to the shore.

Troy yet found grace before the Olympian sire,
He arm'd their hands, and fill'd their breasts with fire.
The Greeks repulsed, retreat behind their wall,
Or in the trench on heaps confusedly fall.
First of the foe, great Hector march'd along,
With terror clothed, and more than mortal strong.
As the bold hound, that gives the lion chase,
With beating bosom, and with eager pace,
Hangs on his haunch, or fastens on his heels,
Guards as he turns, and circles as he wheels;
Thus oft the Grecians turn'd, but still they flew;
Thus following, Hector still the hindmost slew.
When flying they had pass'd the trench profound,
And many a chief lay gasping on the ground;
Before the ships a desperate stand they made,
And fired the troops, and called the gods to aid.
Fierce on his rattling chariot Hector came:
His eyes like Gorgon shot a sanguine flame
That wither'd all their host: like Mars he stood:
Dire as the monster, dreadful as the god!
Their strong distress the wife of Jove survey'd;
Then pensive thus, to war's triumphant maid:

"O daughter of that god, whose arm can wield
The avenging bolt, and shake the sable shield!
Now, in this moment of her last despair,
Shall wretched Greece no more confess our care,
Condemn'd to suffer the full force of fate,
And drain the dregs of heaven's relentless hate?
Gods! shall one raging hand thus level all?
What numbers fell! what numbers yet shall fall!
What power divine shall Hector's wrath assuage?
Still swells the slaughter, and still grows the rage!"

So spake the imperial regent of the skies;
To whom the goddess with the azure eyes:

"Long since had Hector stain'd these fields with gore,
Stretch'd by some Argive on his native shore:
But he above, the sire of heaven, withstands,
Mocks our attempts, and slights our just demands;
The stubborn god, inflexible and hard,
Forgets my service and deserved reward:
Saved I, for this, his favourite son distress'd,
By stern Eurystheus with long labours press'd?
He begg'd, with tears he begg'd, in deep dismay;
I shot from heaven, and gave his arm the day.
Oh had my wisdom known this dire event,
When to grim Pluto's gloomy gates he went;
The triple dog had never felt his chain,
Nor Styx been cross'd, nor hell explored in vain.
Averse to me of all his heaven of gods,
At Thetis' suit the partial Thunderer nods;
To grace her gloomy, fierce, resenting son,
My hopes are frustrate, and my Greeks undone.
Some future day, perhaps, he may be moved
To call his blue-eyed maid his best beloved.
Haste, launch thy chariot, through yon ranks to ride;
Myself will arm, and thunder at thy side.
Then, goddess! say, shall Hector glory then?
(That terror of the Greeks, that man of men)
When Juno's self, and Pallas shall appear,
All dreadful in the crimson walks of war!
What mighty Trojan then, on yonder shore,
Expiring, pale, and terrible no more,
Shall feast the fowls, and glut the dogs with gore?"

She ceased, and Juno rein'd the steeds with care:
(Heaven's awful empress, Saturn's other heir:)
Pallas, meanwhile, her various veil unbound,
With flowers adorn'd, with art immortal crown'd;
The radiant robe her sacred fingers wove
Floats in rich waves, and spreads the court of Jove.
Her father's arms her mighty limbs invest,
His cuirass blazes on her ample breast.
The vigorous power the trembling car ascends:
Shook by her arm, the massy javelin bends:
Huge, ponderous, strong! that when her fury burns
Proud tyrants humbles, and whole hosts o'erturns.

Saturnia lends the lash; the coursers fly;
Smooth glides the chariot through the liquid sky.
Heaven's gates spontaneous open to the powers,
Heaven's golden gates, kept by the winged Hours.
Commission'd in alternate watch they stand,
The sun's bright portals and the skies command;
Close, or unfold, the eternal gates of day
Bar heaven with clouds, or roll those clouds away.
The sounding hinges ring, the clouds divide.
Prone down the steep of heaven their course they guide.
But Jove, incensed, from Ida's top survey'd,
And thus enjoin'd the many-colour'd maid.

     [Illustration: JUNO AND MINERVA GOING TO ASSIST THE GREEKS.]

             JUNO AND MINERVA GOING TO ASSIST THE GREEKS.


"Thaumantia! mount the winds, and stop their car;
Against the highest who shall wage the war?
If furious yet they dare the vain debate,
Thus have I spoke, and what I speak is fate:
Their coursers crush'd beneath the wheels shall lie,
Their car in fragments, scatter'd o'er the sky:
My lightning these rebellious shall confound,
And hurl them flaming, headlong, to the ground,
Condemn'd for ten revolving years to weep
The wounds impress'd by burning thunder deep.
So shall Minerva learn to fear our ire,
Nor dare to combat hers and nature's sire.
For Juno, headstrong and imperious still,
She claims some title to transgress our will."

Swift as the wind, the various-colour'd maid
From Ida's top her golden wings display'd;
To great Olympus' shining gate she flies,
There meets the chariot rushing down the skies,
Restrains their progress from the bright abodes,
And speaks the mandate of the sire of gods.

"What frenzy goddesses! what rage can move
Celestial minds to tempt the wrath of Jove?
Desist, obedient to his high command:
This is his word; and know his word shall stand:
His lightning your rebellion shall confound,
And hurl ye headlong, flaming, to the ground;
Your horses crush'd beneath the wheels shall lie,
Your car in fragments scatter'd o'er the sky;
Yourselves condemn'd ten rolling years to weep
The wounds impress'd by burning thunder deep.
So shall Minerva learn to fear his ire,
Nor dare to combat hers and nature's sire.
For Juno, headstrong and imperious still,
She claims some title to transgress his will:
But thee, what desperate insolence has driven
To lift thy lance against the king of heaven?"

Then, mounting on the pinions of the wind,
She flew; and Juno thus her rage resign'd:

"O daughter of that god, whose arm can wield
The avenging bolt, and shake the dreadful shield
No more let beings of superior birth
Contend with Jove for this low race of earth;
Triumphant now, now miserably slain,
They breathe or perish as the fates ordain:
But Jove's high counsels full effect shall find;
And, ever constant, ever rule mankind."

She spoke, and backward turn'd her steeds of light,
Adorn'd with manes of gold, and heavenly bright.
The Hours unloosed them, panting as they stood,
And heap'd their mangers with ambrosial food.
There tied, they rest in high celestial stalls;
The chariot propp'd against the crystal walls,
The pensive goddesses, abash'd, controll'd,
Mix with the gods, and fill their seats of gold.

     [Illustration: THE HOURS TAKING THE HORSES FROM JUNO'S CAR.]

             THE HOURS TAKING THE HORSES FROM JUNO'S CAR.


And now the Thunderer meditates his flight
From Ida's summits to the Olympian height.
Swifter than thought, the wheels instinctive fly,
Flame through the vast of air, and reach the sky.
'Twas Neptune's charge his coursers to unbrace,
And fix the car on its immortal base;
There stood the chariot, beaming forth its rays,
Till with a snowy veil he screen'd the blaze.
He, whose all-conscious eyes the world behold,
The eternal Thunderer sat, enthroned in gold.
High heaven the footstool of his feet he makes,
And wide beneath him all Olympus shakes.
Trembling afar the offending powers appear'd,
Confused and silent, for his frown they fear'd.
He saw their soul, and thus his word imparts:
"Pallas and Juno! say, why heave your hearts?
Soon was your battle o'er: proud Troy retired
Before your face, and in your wrath expired.
But know, whoe'er almighty power withstand!
Unmatch'd our force, unconquer'd is our hand:
Who shall the sovereign of the skies control?
Not all the gods that crown the starry pole.
Your hearts shall tremble, if our arms we take,
And each immortal nerve with horror shake.
For thus I speak, and what I speak shall stand;
What power soe'er provokes our lifted hand,
On this our hill no more shall hold his place;
Cut off, and exiled from the ethereal race."

Juno and Pallas grieving hear the doom,
But feast their souls on Ilion's woes to come.
Though secret anger swell'd Minerva's breast,
The prudent goddess yet her wrath repress'd;
But Juno, impotent of rage, replies:
"What hast thou said, O tyrant of the skies!
Strength and omnipotence invest thy throne;
'Tis thine to punish; ours to grieve alone.
For Greece we grieve, abandon'd by her fate
To drink the dregs of thy unmeasured hate.
From fields forbidden we submiss refrain,
With arms unaiding see our Argives slain;
Yet grant our counsels still their breasts may move,
Lest all should perish in the rage of Jove."

The goddess thus; and thus the god replies,
Who swells the clouds, and blackens all the skies:

"The morning sun, awaked by loud alarms,
Shall see the almighty Thunderer in arms.
What heaps of Argives then shall load the plain,
Those radiant eyes shall view, and view in vain.
Nor shall great Hector cease the rage of fight,
The navy flaming, and thy Greeks in flight,
Even till the day when certain fates ordain
That stern Achilles (his Patroclus slain)
Shall rise in vengeance, and lay waste the plain.
For such is fate, nor canst thou turn its course
With all thy rage, with all thy rebel force.
Fly, if thy wilt, to earth's remotest bound,
Where on her utmost verge the seas resound;
Where cursed Iapetus and Saturn dwell,
Fast by the brink, within the streams of hell;
No sun e'er gilds the gloomy horrors there;
No cheerful gales refresh the lazy air:
There arm once more the bold Titanian band;
And arm in vain; for what I will, shall stand."

Now deep in ocean sunk the lamp of light,
And drew behind the cloudy veil of night:
The conquering Trojans mourn his beams decay'd;
The Greeks rejoicing bless the friendly shade.

The victors keep the field; and Hector calls
A martial council near the navy walls;
These to Scamander's bank apart he led,
Where thinly scatter'd lay the heaps of dead.
The assembled chiefs, descending on the ground,
Attend his order, and their prince surround.
A massy spear he bore of mighty strength,
Of full ten cubits was the lance's length;
The point was brass, refulgent to behold,
Fix'd to the wood with circling rings of gold:
The noble Hector on his lance reclined,
And, bending forward, thus reveal'd his mind:

"Ye valiant Trojans, with attention hear!
Ye Dardan bands, and generous aids, give ear!
This day, we hoped, would wrap in conquering flame
Greece with her ships, and crown our toils with fame.
But darkness now, to save the cowards, falls,
And guards them trembling in their wooden walls.
Obey the night, and use her peaceful hours
Our steeds to forage, and refresh our powers.
Straight from the town be sheep and oxen sought,
And strengthening bread and generous wine be brought
Wide o'er the field, high blazing to the sky,
Let numerous fires the absent sun supply,
The flaming piles with plenteous fuel raise,
Till the bright morn her purple beam displays;
Lest, in the silence and the shades of night,
Greece on her sable ships attempt her flight.
Not unmolested let the wretches gain
Their lofty decks, or safely cleave the main;
Some hostile wound let every dart bestow,
Some lasting token of the Phrygian foe,
Wounds, that long hence may ask their spouses' care.
And warn their children from a Trojan war.
Now through the circuit of our Ilion wall,
Let sacred heralds sound the solemn call;
To bid the sires with hoary honours crown'd,
And beardless youths, our battlements surround.
Firm be the guard, while distant lie our powers,
And let the matrons hang with lights the towers;
Lest, under covert of the midnight shade,
The insidious foe the naked town invade.
Suffice, to-night, these orders to obey;
A nobler charge shall rouse the dawning day.
The gods, I trust, shall give to Hector's hand
From these detested foes to free the land,
Who plough'd, with fates averse, the watery way:
For Trojan vultures a predestined prey.
Our common safety must be now the care;
But soon as morning paints the fields of air,
Sheathed in bright arms let every troop engage,
And the fired fleet behold the battle rage.
Then, then shall Hector and Tydides prove
Whose fates are heaviest in the scales of Jove.
To-morrow's light (O haste the glorious morn!)
Shall see his bloody spoils in triumph borne,
With this keen javelin shall his breast be gored,
And prostrate heroes bleed around their lord.
Certain as this, oh! might my days endure,
From age inglorious, and black death secure;
So might my life and glory know no bound,
Like Pallas worshipp'd, like the sun renown'd!
As the next dawn, the last they shall enjoy,
Shall crush the Greeks, and end the woes of Troy."

The leader spoke. From all his host around
Shouts of applause along the shores resound.
Each from the yoke the smoking steeds untied,
And fix'd their headstalls to his chariot-side.
Fat sheep and oxen from the town are led,
With generous wine, and all-sustaining bread,
Full hecatombs lay burning on the shore:
The winds to heaven the curling vapours bore.
Ungrateful offering to the immortal powers!(197)
Whose wrath hung heavy o'er the Trojan towers:
Nor Priam nor his sons obtain'd their grace;
Proud Troy they hated, and her guilty race.

The troops exulting sat in order round,
And beaming fires illumined all the ground.
As when the moon, refulgent lamp of night,(198)
O'er heaven's pure azure spreads her sacred light,
When not a breath disturbs the deep serene,
And not a cloud o'ercasts the solemn scene,
Around her throne the vivid planets roll,
And stars unnumber'd gild the glowing pole,
O'er the dark trees a yellower verdure shed,
And tip with silver every mountain's head:
Then shine the vales, the rocks in prospect rise,
A flood of glory bursts from all the skies:
The conscious swains, rejoicing in the sight,
Eye the blue vault, and bless the useful light.
So many flames before proud Ilion blaze,
And lighten glimmering Xanthus with their rays.
The long reflections of the distant fires
Gleam on the walls, and tremble on the spires.
A thousand piles the dusky horrors gild,
And shoot a shady lustre o'er the field.
Full fifty guards each flaming pile attend,
Whose umber'd arms, by fits, thick flashes send,
Loud neigh the coursers o'er their heaps of corn,
And ardent warriors wait the rising morn.

               [Illustration: THE SHIELD OF ACHILLES.]

                       THE SHIELD OF ACHILLES.





BOOK IX.


ARGUMENT.

THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.

Agamemnon, after the last day's defeat, proposes to the Greeks to quit the
siege, and return to their country. Diomed opposes this, and Nestor
seconds him, praising his wisdom and resolution. He orders the guard to be
strengthened, and a council summoned to deliberate what measures are to be
followed in this emergency. Agamemnon pursues this advice, and Nestor
further prevails upon him to send ambassadors to Achilles, in order to
move him to a reconciliation. Ulysses and Ajax are made choice of, who are
accompanied by old Phoenix. They make, each of them, very moving and
pressing speeches, but are rejected with roughness by Achilles, who
notwithstanding retains Phoenix in his tent. The ambassadors return
unsuccessfully to the camp, and the troops betake themselves to sleep.

This book, and the next following, take up the space of one night, which
is the twenty-seventh from the beginning of the poem. The scene lies on
the sea-shore, the station of the Grecian ships.

Thus joyful Troy maintain'd the watch of night;
While fear, pale comrade of inglorious flight,(199)
And heaven-bred horror, on the Grecian part,
Sat on each face, and sadden'd every heart.
As from its cloudy dungeon issuing forth,
A double tempest of the west and north
Swells o'er the sea, from Thracia's frozen shore,
Heaps waves on waves, and bids the Ćgean roar:
This way and that the boiling deeps are toss'd:
Such various passions urged the troubled host,
Great Agamemnon grieved above the rest;
Superior sorrows swell'd his royal breast;
Himself his orders to the heralds bears,
To bid to council all the Grecian peers,
But bid in whispers: these surround their chief,
In solemn sadness and majestic grief.
The king amidst the mournful circle rose:
Down his wan cheek a briny torrent flows.
So silent fountains, from a rock's tall head,
In sable streams soft-trickling waters shed.
With more than vulgar grief he stood oppress'd;
Words, mix'd with sighs, thus bursting from his breast:

"Ye sons of Greece! partake your leader's care;
Fellows in arms and princes of the war!
Of partial Jove too justly we complain,
And heavenly oracles believed in vain.
A safe return was promised to our toils,
With conquest honour'd and enrich'd with spoils:
Now shameful flight alone can save the host;
Our wealth, our people, and our glory lost.
So Jove decrees, almighty lord of all!
Jove, at whose nod whole empires rise or fall,
Who shakes the feeble props of human trust,
And towers and armies humbles to the dust.
Haste then, for ever quit these fatal fields,
Haste to the joys our native country yields;
Spread all your canvas, all your oars employ,
Nor hope the fall of heaven-defended Troy."

He said: deep silence held the Grecian band;
Silent, unmov'd in dire dismay they stand;
A pensive scene! till Tydeus' warlike son
Roll'd on the king his eyes, and thus begun:
"When kings advise us to renounce our fame,
First let him speak who first has suffer'd shame.
If I oppose thee, prince! thy wrath withhold,
The laws of council bid my tongue be bold.
Thou first, and thou alone, in fields of fight,
Durst brand my courage, and defame my might:
Nor from a friend the unkind reproach appear'd,
The Greeks stood witness, all our army heard.
The gods, O chief! from whom our honours spring,
The gods have made thee but by halves a king:
They gave thee sceptres, and a wide command;
They gave dominion o'er the seas and land;
The noblest power that might the world control
They gave thee not--a brave and virtuous soul.
Is this a general's voice, that would suggest
Fears like his own to every Grecian breast?
Confiding in our want of worth, he stands;
And if we fly, 'tis what our king commands.
Go thou, inglorious! from the embattled plain;
Ships thou hast store, and nearest to the main;
A noble care the Grecians shall employ,
To combat, conquer, and extirpate Troy.
Here Greece shall stay; or, if all Greece retire,
Myself shall stay, till Troy or I expire;
Myself, and Sthenelus, will fight for fame;
God bade us fight, and 'twas with God we came."

He ceased; the Greeks loud acclamations raise,
And voice to voice resounds Tydides' praise.
Wise Nestor then his reverend figure rear'd;
He spoke: the host in still attention heard:(200)

"O truly great! in whom the gods have join'd
Such strength of body with such force of mind:
In conduct, as in courage, you excel,
Still first to act what you advise so well.
These wholesome counsels which thy wisdom moves,
Applauding Greece with common voice approves.
Kings thou canst blame; a bold but prudent youth:
And blame even kings with praise, because with truth.
And yet those years that since thy birth have run
Would hardly style thee Nestor's youngest son.
Then let me add what yet remains behind,
A thought unfinish'd in that generous mind;
Age bids me speak! nor shall the advice I bring
Distaste the people, or offend the king:

"Cursed is the man, and void of law and right,
Unworthy property, unworthy light,
Unfit for public rule, or private care,
That wretch, that monster, who delights in war;
Whose lust is murder, and whose horrid joy,
To tear his country, and his kind destroy!
This night, refresh and fortify thy train;
Between the trench and wall let guards remain:
Be that the duty of the young and bold;
But thou, O king, to council call the old;
Great is thy sway, and weighty are thy cares;
Thy high commands must spirit all our wars.
With Thracian wines recruit thy honour'd guests,
For happy counsels flow from sober feasts.
Wise, weighty counsels aid a state distress'd,
And such a monarch as can choose the best.
See what a blaze from hostile tents aspires,
How near our fleet approach the Trojan fires!
Who can, unmoved, behold the dreadful light?
What eye beholds them, and can close to-night?
This dreadful interval determines all;
To-morrow, Troy must flame, or Greece must fall."

Thus spoke the hoary sage: the rest obey;
Swift through the gates the guards direct their way.
His son was first to pass the lofty mound,
The generous Thrasymed, in arms renown'd:
Next him, Ascalaphus, Ialmen, stood,
The double offspring of the warrior-god:
Deipyrus, Aphareus, Merion join,
And Lycomed of Creon's noble line.
Seven were the leaders of the nightly bands,
And each bold chief a hundred spears commands.
The fires they light, to short repasts they fall,
Some line the trench, and others man the wall.

The king of men, on public counsels bent,
Convened the princes in his ample tent,
Each seized a portion of the kingly feast,
But stay'd his hand when thirst and hunger ceased.
Then Nestor spoke, for wisdom long approved,
And slowly rising, thus the council moved.

"Monarch of nations! whose superior sway
Assembled states, and lords of earth obey,
The laws and sceptres to thy hand are given,
And millions own the care of thee and Heaven.
O king! the counsels of my age attend;
With thee my cares begin, with thee must end.
Thee, prince! it fits alike to speak and hear,
Pronounce with judgment, with regard give ear,
To see no wholesome motion be withstood,
And ratify the best for public good.
Nor, though a meaner give advice, repine,
But follow it, and make the wisdom thine.
Hear then a thought, not now conceived in haste,
At once my present judgment and my past.
When from Pelides' tent you forced the maid,
I first opposed, and faithful, durst dissuade;
But bold of soul, when headlong fury fired,
You wronged the man, by men and gods admired:
Now seek some means his fatal wrath to end,
With prayers to move him, or with gifts to bend."

To whom the king. "With justice hast thou shown
A prince's faults, and I with reason own.
That happy man, whom Jove still honours most,
Is more than armies, and himself a host.
Bless'd in his love, this wondrous hero stands;
Heaven fights his war, and humbles all our bands.
Fain would my heart, which err'd through frantic rage,
The wrathful chief and angry gods assuage.
If gifts immense his mighty soul can bow,(201)
Hear, all ye Greeks, and witness what I vow.
Ten weighty talents of the purest gold,
And twice ten vases of refulgent mould:
Seven sacred tripods, whose unsullied frame
Yet knows no office, nor has felt the flame;
Twelve steeds unmatch'd in fleetness and in force,
And still victorious in the dusty course;
(Rich were the man whose ample stores exceed
The prizes purchased by their winged speed;)
Seven lovely captives of the Lesbian line,
Skill'd in each art, unmatch'd in form divine,
The same I chose for more than vulgar charms,
When Lesbos sank beneath the hero's arms:
All these, to buy his friendship, shall be paid,
And join'd with these the long-contested maid;
With all her charms, Briseis I resign,
And solemn swear those charms were never mine;
Untouch'd she stay'd, uninjured she removes,
Pure from my arms, and guiltless of my loves,(202)
These instant shall be his; and if the powers
Give to our arms proud Ilion's hostile towers,
Then shall he store (when Greece the spoil divides)
With gold and brass his loaded navy's sides:
Besides, full twenty nymphs of Trojan race
With copious love shall crown his warm embrace,
Such as himself will choose; who yield to none,
Or yield to Helen's heavenly charms alone.
Yet hear me further: when our wars are o'er,
If safe we land on Argos' fruitful shore,
There shall he live my son, our honours share,
And with Orestes' self divide my care.
Yet more--three daughters in my court are bred,
And each well worthy of a royal bed;
Laodice and Iphigenia fair,(203)
And bright Chrysothemis with golden hair;
Her let him choose whom most his eyes approve,
I ask no presents, no reward for love:
Myself will give the dower; so vast a store
As never father gave a child before.
Seven ample cities shall confess his sway,
Him Enope, and Pherae him obey,
Cardamyle with ample turrets crown'd,
And sacred Pedasus for vines renown'd;
Ćpea fair, the pastures Hira yields,
And rich Antheia with her flowery fields:(204)
The whole extent to Pylos' sandy plain,
Along the verdant margin of the main
There heifers graze, and labouring oxen toil;
Bold are the men, and generous is the soil;
There shall he reign, with power and justice crown'd,
And rule the tributary realms around.
All this I give, his vengeance to control,
And sure all this may move his mighty soul.
Pluto, the grisly god, who never spares,
Who feels no mercy, and who hears no prayers,
Lives dark and dreadful in deep hell's abodes,
And mortals hate him, as the worst of gods
Great though he be, it fits him to obey,
Since more than his my years, and more my sway."

                        [Illustration: PLUTO.]

                                PLUTO.


The monarch thus. The reverend Nestor then:
"Great Agamemnon! glorious king of men!
Such are thy offers as a prince may take,
And such as fits a generous king to make.
Let chosen delegates this hour be sent
(Myself will name them) to Pelides' tent.
Let Phoenix lead, revered for hoary age,
Great Ajax next, and Ithacus the sage.
Yet more to sanctify the word you send,
Let Hodius and Eurybates attend.
Now pray to Jove to grant what Greece demands;
Pray in deep silence,(205) and with purest hands."(206)

               [Illustration: THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.]

                       THE EMBASSY TO ACHILLES.


He said; and all approved. The heralds bring
The cleansing water from the living spring.
The youth with wine the sacred goblets crown'd,
And large libations drench'd the sands around.
The rite perform'd, the chiefs their thirst allay,
Then from the royal tent they take their way;
Wise Nestor turns on each his careful eye,
Forbids to offend, instructs them to apply;
Much he advised them all, Ulysses most,
To deprecate the chief, and save the host.
Through the still night they march, and hear the roar
Of murmuring billows on the sounding shore.
To Neptune, ruler of the seas profound,
Whose liquid arms the mighty globe surround,
They pour forth vows, their embassy to bless,
And calm the rage of stern Ćacides.
And now, arrived, where on the sandy bay
The Myrmidonian tents and vessels lay;
Amused at ease, the godlike man they found,
Pleased with the solemn harp's harmonious sound.
(The well wrought harp from conquered Thebae came;
Of polish'd silver was its costly frame.)
With this he soothes his angry soul, and sings
The immortal deeds of heroes and of kings.
Patroclus only of the royal train,
Placed in his tent, attends the lofty strain:
Full opposite he sat, and listen'd long,
In silence waiting till he ceased the song.
Unseen the Grecian embassy proceeds
To his high tent; the great Ulysses leads.
Achilles starting, as the chiefs he spied,
Leap'd from his seat, and laid the harp aside.
With like surprise arose Menoetius' son:
Pelides grasp'd their hands, and thus begun:

"Princes, all hail! whatever brought you here.
Or strong necessity, or urgent fear;
Welcome, though Greeks! for not as foes ye came;
To me more dear than all that bear the name."

With that, the chiefs beneath his roof he led,
And placed in seats with purple carpets spread.
Then thus--"Patroclus, crown a larger bowl,
Mix purer wine, and open every soul.
Of all the warriors yonder host can send,
Thy friend most honours these, and these thy friend."

He said: Patroclus o'er the blazing fire
Heaps in a brazen vase three chines entire:
The brazen vase Automedon sustains,
Which flesh of porker, sheep, and goat contains.
Achilles at the genial feast presides,
The parts transfixes, and with skill divides.
Meanwhile Patroclus sweats, the fire to raise;
The tent is brighten'd with the rising blaze:
Then, when the languid flames at length subside,
He strows a bed of glowing embers wide,
Above the coals the smoking fragments turns
And sprinkles sacred salt from lifted urns;
With bread the glittering canisters they load,
Which round the board Menoetius' son bestow'd;
Himself, opposed to Ulysses full in sight,
Each portion parts, and orders every rite.
The first fat offering to the immortals due,
Amidst the greedy flames Patroclus threw;
Then each, indulging in the social feast,
His thirst and hunger soberly repress'd.
That done, to Phoenix Ajax gave the sign:
Not unperceived; Ulysses crown'd with wine
The foaming bowl, and instant thus began,
His speech addressing to the godlike man.

"Health to Achilles! happy are thy guests!
Not those more honour'd whom Atrides feasts:
Though generous plenty crown thy loaded boards,
That, Agamemnon's regal tent affords;
But greater cares sit heavy on our souls,
Nor eased by banquets or by flowing bowls.
What scenes of slaughter in yon fields appear!
The dead we mourn, and for the living fear;
Greece on the brink of fate all doubtful stands,
And owns no help but from thy saving hands:
Troy and her aids for ready vengeance call;
Their threatening tents already shade our wall:
Hear how with shouts their conquest they proclaim,
And point at every ship their vengeful flame!
For them the father of the gods declares,
Theirs are his omens, and his thunder theirs.
See, full of Jove, avenging Hector rise!
See! heaven and earth the raging chief defies;
What fury in his breast, what lightning in his eyes!
He waits but for the morn, to sink in flame
The ships, the Greeks, and all the Grecian name.
Heavens! how my country's woes distract my mind,
Lest Fate accomplish all his rage design'd!
And must we, gods! our heads inglorious lay
In Trojan dust, and this the fatal day?
Return, Achilles: oh return, though late,
To save thy Greeks, and stop the course of Fate;
If in that heart or grief or courage lies,
Rise to redeem; ah, yet to conquer, rise!
The day may come, when, all our warriors slain,
That heart shall melt, that courage rise in vain:
Regard in time, O prince divinely brave!
Those wholesome counsels which thy father gave.
When Peleus in his aged arms embraced
His parting son, these accents were his last:

"'My child! with strength, with glory, and success,
Thy arms may Juno and Minerva bless!
Trust that to Heaven: but thou, thy cares engage
To calm thy passions, and subdue thy rage:
From gentler manners let thy glory grow,
And shun contention, the sure source of woe;
That young and old may in thy praise combine,
The virtues of humanity be thine--'
This now-despised advice thy father gave;
Ah! check thy anger; and be truly brave.
If thou wilt yield to great Atrides' prayers,
Gifts worthy thee his royal hand prepares;
If not--but hear me, while I number o'er
The proffer'd presents, an exhaustless store.
Ten weighty talents of the purest gold,
And twice ten vases of refulgent mould;
Seven sacred tripods, whose unsullied frame
Yet knows no office, nor has felt the flame;
Twelve steeds unmatched in fleetness and in force,
And still victorious in the dusty course;
(Rich were the man, whose ample stores exceed
The prizes purchased by their winged speed;)
Seven lovely captives of the Lesbian line,
Skill'd in each art, unmatch'd in form divine,
The same he chose for more than vulgar charms,
When Lesbos sank beneath thy conquering arms.
All these, to buy thy friendship shall be paid,
And, join'd with these, the long-contested maid;
With all her charms, Briseis he'll resign,
And solemn swear those charms were only thine;
Untouch'd she stay'd, uninjured she removes,
Pure from his arms, and guiltless of his loves.
These instant shall be thine; and if the powers
Give to our arms proud Ilion's hostile towers,
Then shalt thou store (when Greece the spoil divides)
With gold and brass thy loaded navy's sides.
Besides, full twenty nymphs of Trojan race
With copious love shall crown thy warm embrace;
Such as thyself shall chose; who yield to none,
Or yield to Helen's heavenly charms alone.
Yet hear me further: when our wars are o'er,
If safe we land on Argos' fruitful shore,
There shalt thou live his son, his honour share,
And with Orestes' self divide his care.
Yet more--three daughters in his court are bred,
And each well worthy of a royal bed:
Laodice and Iphigenia fair,
And bright Chrysothemis with golden hair:
Her shalt thou wed whom most thy eyes approve;
He asks no presents, no reward for love:
Himself will give the dower; so vast a store
As never father gave a child before.
Seven ample cities shall confess thy sway,
The Enope and Pherae thee obey,
Cardamyle with ample turrets crown'd,
And sacred Pedasus, for vines renown'd:
Ćpea fair, the pastures Hira yields,
And rich Antheia with her flowery fields;
The whole extent to Pylos' sandy plain,
Along the verdant margin of the main.
There heifers graze, and labouring oxen toil;
Bold are the men, and generous is the soil.
There shalt thou reign, with power and justice crown'd,
And rule the tributary realms around.
Such are the proffers which this day we bring,
Such the repentance of a suppliant king.
But if all this, relentless, thou disdain,
If honour and if interest plead in vain,
Yet some redress to suppliant Greece afford,
And be, amongst her guardian gods, adored.
If no regard thy suffering country claim,
Hear thy own glory, and the voice of fame:
For now that chief, whose unresisted ire
Made nations tremble, and whole hosts retire,
Proud Hector, now, the unequal fight demands,
And only triumphs to deserve thy hands."

Then thus the goddess-born: "Ulysses, hear
A faithful speech, that knows nor art nor fear;
What in my secret soul is understood,
My tongue shall utter, and my deeds make good.
Let Greece then know, my purpose I retain:
Nor with new treaties vex my peace in vain.
Who dares think one thing, and another tell,
My heart detests him as the gates of hell.

"Then thus in short my fix'd resolves attend,
Which nor Atrides nor his Greeks can bend;
Long toils, long perils in their cause I bore,
But now the unfruitful glories charm no more.
Fight or not fight, a like reward we claim,
The wretch and hero find their prize the same.
Alike regretted in the dust he lies,
Who yields ignobly, or who bravely dies.
Of all my dangers, all my glorious pains,
A life of labours, lo! what fruit remains?
As the bold bird her helpless young attends,
From danger guards them, and from want defends;
In search of prey she wings the spacious air,
And with the untasted food supplies her care:
For thankless Greece such hardships have I braved,
Her wives, her infants, by my labours saved;
Long sleepless nights in heavy arms I stood,
And sweat laborious days in dust and blood.
I sack'd twelve ample cities on the main,(207)
And twelve lay smoking on the Trojan plain:
Then at Atrides' haughty feet were laid
The wealth I gathered, and the spoils I made.
Your mighty monarch these in peace possess'd;
Some few my soldiers had, himself the rest.
Some present, too, to every prince was paid;
And every prince enjoys the gift he made:
I only must refund, of all his train;
See what pre-eminence our merits gain!
My spoil alone his greedy soul delights:
My spouse alone must bless his lustful nights:
The woman, let him (as he may) enjoy;
But what's the quarrel, then, of Greece to Troy?
What to these shores the assembled nations draws,
What calls for vengeance but a woman's cause?
Are fair endowments and a beauteous face
Beloved by none but those of Atreus' race?
The wife whom choice and passion doth approve,
Sure every wise and worthy man will love.
Nor did my fair one less distinction claim;
Slave as she was, my soul adored the dame.
Wrong'd in my love, all proffers I disdain;
Deceived for once, I trust not kings again.
Ye have my answer--what remains to do,
Your king, Ulysses, may consult with you.
What needs he the defence this arm can make?
Has he not walls no human force can shake?
Has he not fenced his guarded navy round
With piles, with ramparts, and a trench profound?
And will not these (the wonders he has done)
Repel the rage of Priam's single son?
There was a time ('twas when for Greece I fought)
When Hector's prowess no such wonders wrought;
He kept the verge of Troy, nor dared to wait
Achilles' fury at the Scaean gate;
He tried it once, and scarce was saved by fate.
But now those ancient enmities are o'er;
To-morrow we the favouring gods implore;
Then shall you see our parting vessels crown'd,
And hear with oars the Hellespont resound.
The third day hence shall Pthia greet our sails,(208)
If mighty Neptune send propitious gales;
Pthia to her Achilles shall restore
The wealth he left for this detested shore:
Thither the spoils of this long war shall pass,
The ruddy gold, the steel, and shining brass:
My beauteous captives thither I'll convey,
And all that rests of my unravish'd prey.
One only valued gift your tyrant gave,
And that resumed--the fair Lyrnessian slave.
Then tell him: loud, that all the Greeks may hear,
And learn to scorn the wretch they basely fear;
(For arm'd in impudence, mankind he braves,
And meditates new cheats on all his slaves;
Though shameless as he is, to face these eyes
Is what he dares not: if he dares he dies;)
Tell him, all terms, all commerce I decline,
Nor share his council, nor his battle join;
For once deceiv'd, was his; but twice were mine,
No--let the stupid prince, whom Jove deprives
Of sense and justice, run where frenzy drives;
His gifts are hateful: kings of such a kind
Stand but as slaves before a noble mind,
Not though he proffer'd all himself possess'd,
And all his rapine could from others wrest:
Not all the golden tides of wealth that crown
The many-peopled Orchomenian town;(209)
Not all proud Thebes' unrivall'd walls contain,
The world's great empress on the Egyptian plain
(That spreads her conquests o'er a thousand states,
And pours her heroes through a hundred gates,
Two hundred horsemen and two hundred cars
From each wide portal issuing to the wars);(210)
Though bribes were heap'd on bribes, in number more
Than dust in fields, or sands along the shore;
Should all these offers for my friendship call,
'Tis he that offers, and I scorn them all.
Atrides' daughter never shall be led
(An ill-match'd consort) to Achilles' bed;
Like golden Venus though she charm'd the heart,
And vied with Pallas in the works of art;
Some greater Greek let those high nuptials grace,
I hate alliance with a tyrant's race.
If heaven restore me to my realms with life,
The reverend Peleus shall elect my wife;
Thessalian nymphs there are of form divine,
And kings that sue to mix their blood with mine.
Bless'd in kind love, my years shall glide away,
Content with just hereditary sway;
There, deaf for ever to the martial strife,
Enjoy the dear prerogative of life.
Life is not to be bought with heaps of gold.
Not all Apollo's Pythian treasures hold,
Or Troy once held, in peace and pride of sway,
Can bribe the poor possession of a day!
Lost herds and treasures we by arms regain,
And steeds unrivall'd on the dusty plain:
But from our lips the vital spirit fled,
Returns no more to wake the silent dead.
My fates long since by Thetis were disclosed,
And each alternate, life or fame, proposed;
Here, if I stay, before the Trojan town,
Short is my date, but deathless my renown:
If I return, I quit immortal praise
For years on years, and long-extended days.
Convinced, though late, I find my fond mistake,
And warn the Greeks the wiser choice to make;
To quit these shores, their native seats enjoy,
Nor hope the fall of heaven-defended Troy.
Jove's arm display'd asserts her from the skies!
Her hearts are strengthen'd, and her glories rise.
Go then to Greece, report our fix'd design;
Bid all your counsels, all your armies join,
Let all your forces, all your arts conspire,
To save the ships, the troops, the chiefs, from fire.
One stratagem has fail'd, and others will:
Ye find, Achilles is unconquer'd still.
Go then--digest my message as ye may--
But here this night let reverend Phoenix stay:
His tedious toils and hoary hairs demand
A peaceful death in Pthia's friendly land.
But whether he remain or sail with me,
His age be sacred, and his will be free."

                    [Illustration: GREEK GALLEY.]

                            GREEK GALLEY.


The son of Peleus ceased: the chiefs around
In silence wrapt, in consternation drown'd,
Attend the stern reply. Then Phoenix rose;
(Down his white beard a stream of sorrow flows;)
And while the fate of suffering Greece he mourn'd,
With accent weak these tender words return'd.

                     [Illustration: PROSERPINE.]

                             PROSERPINE.


"Divine Achilles! wilt thou then retire,
And leave our hosts in blood, our fleets on fire?
If wrath so dreadful fill thy ruthless mind,
How shall thy friend, thy Phoenix, stay behind?
The royal Peleus, when from Pthia's coast
He sent thee early to the Achaian host;
Thy youth as then in sage debates unskill'd,
And new to perils of the direful field:
He bade me teach thee all the ways of war,
To shine in councils, and in camps to dare.
Never, ah, never let me leave thy side!
No time shall part us, and no fate divide,
Not though the god, that breathed my life, restore
The bloom I boasted, and the port I bore,
When Greece of old beheld my youthful flames
(Delightful Greece, the land of lovely dames),
My father faithless to my mother's arms,
Old as he was, adored a stranger's charms.
I tried what youth could do (at her desire)
To win the damsel, and prevent my sire.
My sire with curses loads my hated head,
And cries, 'Ye furies! barren be his bed.'
Infernal Jove, the vengeful fiends below,
And ruthless Proserpine, confirm'd his vow.
Despair and grief distract my labouring mind!
Gods! what a crime my impious heart design'd!
I thought (but some kind god that thought suppress'd)
To plunge the poniard in my father's breast;
Then meditate my flight: my friends in vain
With prayers entreat me, and with force detain.
On fat of rams, black bulls, and brawny swine,
They daily feast, with draughts of fragrant wine;
Strong guards they placed, and watch'd nine nights entire;
The roofs and porches flamed with constant fire.
The tenth, I forced the gates, unseen of all:
And, favour'd by the night, o'erleap'd the wall,
My travels thence through spacious Greece extend;
In Phthia's court at last my labours end.
Your sire received me, as his son caress'd,
With gifts enrich'd, and with possessions bless'd.
The strong Dolopians thenceforth own'd my reign,
And all the coast that runs along the main.
By love to thee his bounties I repaid,
And early wisdom to thy soul convey'd:
Great as thou art, my lessons made thee brave:
A child I took thee, but a hero gave.
Thy infant breast a like affection show'd;
Still in my arms (an ever-pleasing load)
Or at my knee, by Phoenix wouldst thou stand;
No food was grateful but from Phoenix' hand.(211)
I pass my watchings o'er thy helpless years,
The tender labours, the compliant cares,
The gods (I thought) reversed their hard decree,
And Phoenix felt a father's joys in thee:
Thy growing virtues justified my cares,
And promised comfort to my silver hairs.
Now be thy rage, thy fatal rage, resign'd;
A cruel heart ill suits a manly mind:
The gods (the only great, and only wise)
Are moved by offerings, vows, and sacrifice;
Offending man their high compassion wins,
And daily prayers atone for daily sins.
Prayers are Jove's daughters, of celestial race,
Lame are their feet, and wrinkled is their face;
With humble mien, and with dejected eyes,
Constant they follow, where injustice flies.
Injustice swift, erect, and unconfined,
Sweeps the wide earth, and tramples o'er mankind,
While Prayers, to heal her wrongs, move slow behind.
Who hears these daughters of almighty Jove,
For him they mediate to the throne above
When man rejects the humble suit they make,
The sire revenges for the daughters' sake;
From Jove commission'd, fierce injustice then
Descends to punish unrelenting men.
O let not headlong passion bear the sway
These reconciling goddesses obey
Due honours to the seed of Jove belong,
Due honours calm the fierce, and bend the strong.
Were these not paid thee by the terms we bring,
Were rage still harbour'd in the haughty king;
Nor Greece nor all her fortunes should engage
Thy friend to plead against so just a rage.
But since what honour asks the general sends,
And sends by those whom most thy heart commends;
The best and noblest of the Grecian train;
Permit not these to sue, and sue in vain!
Let me (my son) an ancient fact unfold,
A great example drawn from times of old;
Hear what our fathers were, and what their praise,
Who conquer'd their revenge in former days.

"Where Calydon on rocky mountains stands(212)
Once fought the Ćtolian and Curetian bands;
To guard it those; to conquer, these advance;
And mutual deaths were dealt with mutual chance.
The silver Cynthia bade contention rise,
In vengeance of neglected sacrifice;
On OEneus fields she sent a monstrous boar,
That levell'd harvests, and whole forests tore:
This beast (when many a chief his tusks had slain)
Great Meleager stretch'd along the plain,
Then, for his spoils, a new debate arose,
The neighbour nations thence commencing foes.
Strong as they were, the bold Curetes fail'd,
While Meleager's thundering arm prevail'd:
Till rage at length inflamed his lofty breast
(For rage invades the wisest and the best).

"Cursed by Althaea, to his wrath he yields,
And in his wife's embrace forgets the fields.
(She from Marpessa sprung, divinely fair,
And matchless Idas, more than man in war:
The god of day adored the mother's charms;
Against the god the father bent his arms:
The afflicted pair, their sorrows to proclaim,
From Cleopatra changed their daughter's name,
And call'd Alcyone; a name to show
The father's grief, the mourning mother's woe.)
To her the chief retired from stern debate,
But found no peace from fierce Althaea's hate:
Althaea's hate the unhappy warrior drew,
Whose luckless hand his royal uncle slew;
She beat the ground, and call'd the powers beneath
On her own son to wreak her brother's death;
Hell heard her curses from the realms profound,
And the red fiends that walk the nightly round.
In vain Ćtolia her deliverer waits,
War shakes her walls, and thunders at her gates.
She sent ambassadors, a chosen band,
Priests of the gods, and elders of the land;
Besought the chief to save the sinking state:
Their prayers were urgent, and their proffers great:
(Full fifty acres of the richest ground,
Half pasture green, and half with vineyards crown'd:)
His suppliant father, aged OEneus, came;
His sisters follow'd; even the vengeful dame,
Althaea, sues; his friends before him fall:
He stands relentless, and rejects them all.
Meanwhile the victor's shouts ascend the skies;
The walls are scaled; the rolling flames arise;
At length his wife (a form divine) appears,
With piercing cries, and supplicating tears;
She paints the horrors of a conquer'd town,
The heroes slain, the palaces o'erthrown,
The matrons ravish'd, the whole race enslaved:
The warrior heard, he vanquish'd, and he saved.
The Ćtolians, long disdain'd, now took their turn,
And left the chief their broken faith to mourn.
Learn hence, betimes to curb pernicious ire,
Nor stay till yonder fleets ascend in fire;
Accept the presents; draw thy conquering sword;
And be amongst our guardian gods adored."

Thus he: the stern Achilles thus replied:
"My second father, and my reverend guide:
Thy friend, believe me, no such gifts demands,
And asks no honours from a mortal's hands;
Jove honours me, and favours my designs;
His pleasure guides me, and his will confines;
And here I stay (if such his high behest)
While life's warm spirit beats within my breast.
Yet hear one word, and lodge it in thy heart:
No more molest me on Atrides' part:
Is it for him these tears are taught to flow,
For him these sorrows? for my mortal foe?
A generous friendship no cold medium knows,
Burns with one love, with one resentment glows;
One should our interests and our passions be;
My friend must hate the man that injures me.
Do this, my Phoenix, 'tis a generous part;
And share my realms, my honours, and my heart.
Let these return: our voyage, or our stay,
Rest undetermined till the dawning day."

He ceased; then order'd for the sage's bed
A warmer couch with numerous carpets spread.
With that, stern Ajax his long silence broke,
And thus, impatient, to Ulysses spoke:

"Hence let us go--why waste we time in vain?
See what effect our low submissions gain!
Liked or not liked, his words we must relate,
The Greeks expect them, and our heroes wait.
Proud as he is, that iron heart retains
Its stubborn purpose, and his friends disdains.
Stern and unpitying! if a brother bleed,
On just atonement, we remit the deed;
A sire the slaughter of his son forgives;
The price of blood discharged, the murderer lives:
The haughtiest hearts at length their rage resign,
And gifts can conquer every soul but thine.(213)
The gods that unrelenting breast have steel'd,
And cursed thee with a mind that cannot yield.
One woman-slave was ravish'd from thy arms:
Lo, seven are offer'd, and of equal charms.
Then hear, Achilles! be of better mind;
Revere thy roof, and to thy guests be kind;
And know the men of all the Grecian host,
Who honour worth, and prize thy valour most."

"O soul of battles, and thy people's guide!
(To Ajax thus the first of Greeks replied)
Well hast thou spoke; but at the tyrant's name
My rage rekindles, and my soul's on flame:
'Tis just resentment, and becomes the brave:
Disgraced, dishonour'd, like the vilest slave!
Return, then, heroes! and our answer bear,
The glorious combat is no more my care;
Not till, amidst yon sinking navy slain,
The blood of Greeks shall dye the sable main;
Not till the flames, by Hector's fury thrown,
Consume your vessels, and approach my own;
Just there, the impetuous homicide shall stand,
There cease his battle, and there feel our hand."

This said, each prince a double goblet crown'd,
And cast a large libation on the ground;
Then to their vessels, through the gloomy shades,
The chiefs return; divine Ulysses leads.
Meantime Achilles' slaves prepared a bed,
With fleeces, carpets, and soft linen spread:
There, till the sacred morn restored the day,
In slumber sweet the reverend Phoenix lay.
But in his inner tent, an ampler space,
Achilles slept; and in his warm embrace
Fair Diomede of the Lesbian race.
Last, for Patroclus was the couch prepared,
Whose nightly joys the beauteous Iphis shared;
Achilles to his friend consign'd her charms
When Scyros fell before his conquering arms.

And now the elected chiefs whom Greece had sent,
Pass'd through the hosts, and reach'd the royal tent.
Then rising all, with goblets in their hands,
The peers and leaders of the Achaian bands
Hail'd their return: Atrides first begun:

"Say what success? divine Laertes' son!
Achilles' high resolves declare to all:
"Returns the chief, or must our navy fall?"

"Great king of nations! (Ithacus replied)
Fix'd is his wrath, unconquer'd is his pride;
He slights thy friendship, thy proposals scorns,
And, thus implored, with fiercer fury burns.
To save our army, and our fleets to free,
Is not his care; but left to Greece and thee.
Your eyes shall view, when morning paints the sky,
Beneath his oars the whitening billows fly;
Us too he bids our oars and sails employ,
Nor hope the fall of heaven-protected Troy;
For Jove o'ershades her with his arm divine,
Inspires her war, and bids her glory shine.
Such was his word: what further he declared,
These sacred heralds and great Ajax heard.
But Phoenix in his tent the chief retains,
Safe to transport him to his native plains
When morning dawns; if other he decree,
His age is sacred, and his choice is free."

Ulysses ceased: the great Achaian host,
With sorrow seized, in consternation lost,
Attend the stern reply. Tydides broke
The general silence, and undaunted spoke.
"Why should we gifts to proud Achilles send,
Or strive with prayers his haughty soul to bend?
His country's woes he glories to deride,
And prayers will burst that swelling heart with pride.
Be the fierce impulse of his rage obey'd,
Our battles let him or desert or aid;
Then let him arm when Jove or he think fit:
That, to his madness, or to Heaven commit:
What for ourselves we can, is always ours;
This night, let due repast refresh our powers;
(For strength consists in spirits and in blood,
And those are owed to generous wine and food;)
But when the rosy messenger of day
Strikes the blue mountains with her golden ray,
Ranged at the ships, let all our squadrons shine
In flaming arms, a long-extended line:
In the dread front let great Atrides stand,
The first in danger, as in high command."

Shouts of acclaim the listening heroes raise,
Then each to Heaven the due libations pays;
Till sleep, descending o'er the tents, bestows
The grateful blessings of desired repose."(214)

BOOK X.


ARGUMENT.

THE NIGHT-ADVENTURE OF DIOMED AND ULYSSES.

Upon the refusal of Achilles to return to the army, the distress of
Agamemnon is described in the most lively manner. He takes no rest that
night, but passes through the camp, awaking the leaders, and contriving
all possible methods for the public safety. Menelaus, Nestor, Ulysses, and
Diomed are employed in raising the rest of the captains. They call a
council of war, and determine to send scouts into the enemies' camp, to
learn their posture, and discover their intentions. Diomed undertakes this
hazardous enterprise, and makes choice of Ulysses for his companion. In
their passage they surprise Dolon, whom Hector had sent on a like design
to the camp of the Grecians. From him they are informed of the situation
of the Trojan and auxiliary forces, and particularly of Rhesus, and the
Thracians who were lately arrived. They pass on with success; kill Rhesus,
with several of his officers, and seize the famous horses of that prince,
with which they return in triumph to the camp.

The same night continues; the scene lies in the two camps.

All night the chiefs before their vessels lay,
And lost in sleep the labours of the day:
All but the king: with various thoughts oppress'd,(215)
His country's cares lay rolling in his breast.
As when by lightnings Jove's ethereal power
Foretels the rattling hail, or weighty shower,
Or sends soft snows to whiten all the shore,
Or bids the brazen throat of war to roar;
By fits one flash succeeds as one expires,
And heaven flames thick with momentary fires:
So bursting frequent from Atrides' breast,
Sighs following sighs his inward fears confess'd.
Now o'er the fields, dejected, he surveys
From thousand Trojan fires the mounting blaze;
Hears in the passing wind their music blow,
And marks distinct the voices of the foe.
Now looking backwards to the fleet and coast,
Anxious he sorrows for the endangered host.
He rends his hair, in sacrifice to Jove,
And sues to him that ever lives above:
Inly he groans; while glory and despair
Divide his heart, and wage a double war.

A thousand cares his labouring breast revolves;
To seek sage Nestor now the chief resolves,
With him, in wholesome counsels, to debate
What yet remains to save the afflicted state.
He rose, and first he cast his mantle round,
Next on his feet the shining sandals bound;
A lion's yellow spoils his back conceal'd;
His warlike hand a pointed javelin held.
Meanwhile his brother, press'd with equal woes,
Alike denied the gifts of soft repose,
Laments for Greece, that in his cause before
So much had suffer'd and must suffer more.
A leopard's spotted hide his shoulders spread:
A brazen helmet glitter'd on his head:
Thus (with a javelin in his hand) he went
To wake Atrides in the royal tent.
Already waked, Atrides he descried,
His armour buckling at his vessel's side.
Joyful they met; the Spartan thus begun:
"Why puts my brother his bright armour on?
Sends he some spy, amidst these silent hours,
To try yon camp, and watch the Trojan powers?
But say, what hero shall sustain that task?
Such bold exploits uncommon courage ask;
Guideless, alone, through night's dark shade to go,
And midst a hostile camp explore the foe."

To whom the king: "In such distress we stand,
No vulgar counsel our affairs demand;
Greece to preserve, is now no easy part,
But asks high wisdom, deep design, and art.
For Jove, averse, our humble prayer denies,
And bows his head to Hector's sacrifice.
What eye has witness'd, or what ear believed,
In one great day, by one great arm achieved,
Such wondrous deeds as Hector's hand has done,
And we beheld, the last revolving sun
What honours the beloved of Jove adorn!
Sprung from no god, and of no goddess born;
Yet such his acts, as Greeks unborn shall tell,
And curse the battle where their fathers fell.

"Now speed thy hasty course along the fleet,
There call great Ajax, and the prince of Crete;
Ourself to hoary Nestor will repair;
To keep the guards on duty be his care,
(For Nestor's influence best that quarter guides,
Whose son with Merion, o'er the watch presides.")
To whom the Spartan: "These thy orders borne,
Say, shall I stay, or with despatch return?"
"There shall thou stay, (the king of men replied,)
Else may we miss to meet, without a guide,
The paths so many, and the camp so wide.
Still, with your voice the slothful soldiers raise,
Urge by their fathers' fame their future praise.
Forget we now our state and lofty birth;
Not titles here, but works, must prove our worth.
To labour is the lot of man below;
And when Jove gave us life, he gave us woe."

This said, each parted to his several cares:
The king to Nestor's sable ship repairs;
The sage protector of the Greeks he found
Stretch'd in his bed with all his arms around
The various-colour'd scarf, the shield he rears,
The shining helmet, and the pointed spears;
The dreadful weapons of the warrior's rage,
That, old in arms, disdain'd the peace of age.
Then, leaning on his hand his watchful head,
The hoary monarch raised his eyes and said:

"What art thou, speak, that on designs unknown,
While others sleep, thus range the camp alone;
Seek'st thou some friend or nightly sentinel?
Stand off, approach not, but thy purpose tell."

"O son of Neleus, (thus the king rejoin'd,)
Pride of the Greeks, and glory of thy kind!
Lo, here the wretched Agamemnon stands,
The unhappy general of the Grecian bands,
Whom Jove decrees with daily cares to bend,
And woes, that only with his life shall end!
Scarce can my knees these trembling limbs sustain,
And scarce my heart support its load of pain.
No taste of sleep these heavy eyes have known,
Confused, and sad, I wander thus alone,
With fears distracted, with no fix'd design;
And all my people's miseries are mine.
If aught of use thy waking thoughts suggest,
(Since cares, like mine, deprive thy soul of rest,)
Impart thy counsel, and assist thy friend;
Now let us jointly to the trench descend,
At every gate the fainting guard excite,
Tired with the toils of day and watch of night;
Else may the sudden foe our works invade,
So near, and favour'd by the gloomy shade."

To him thus Nestor: "Trust the powers above,
Nor think proud Hector's hopes confirm'd by Jove:
How ill agree the views of vain mankind,
And the wise counsels of the eternal mind!
Audacious Hector, if the gods ordain
That great Achilles rise and rage again,
What toils attend thee, and what woes remain!
Lo, faithful Nestor thy command obeys;
The care is next our other chiefs to raise:
Ulysses, Diomed, we chiefly need;
Meges for strength, Oileus famed for speed.
Some other be despatch'd of nimbler feet,
To those tall ships, remotest of the fleet,
Where lie great Ajax and the king of Crete.(216)
To rouse the Spartan I myself decree;
Dear as he is to us, and dear to thee,
Yet must I tax his sloth, that claims no share
With his great brother in his martial care:
Him it behoved to every chief to sue,
Preventing every part perform'd by you;
For strong necessity our toils demands,
Claims all our hearts, and urges all our hands."

To whom the king: "With reverence we allow
Thy just rebukes, yet learn to spare them now:
My generous brother is of gentle kind,
He seems remiss, but bears a valiant mind;
Through too much deference to our sovereign sway,
Content to follow when we lead the way:
But now, our ills industrious to prevent,
Long ere the rest he rose, and sought my tent.
The chiefs you named, already at his call,
Prepare to meet us near the navy-wall;
Assembling there, between the trench and gates,
Near the night-guards, our chosen council waits."

"Then none (said Nestor) shall his rule withstand,
For great examples justify command."
With that, the venerable warrior rose;
The shining greaves his manly legs enclose;
His purple mantle golden buckles join'd,
Warm with the softest wool, and doubly lined.
Then rushing from his tent, he snatch'd in haste
His steely lance, that lighten'd as he pass'd.
The camp he traversed through the sleeping crowd,
Stopp'd at Ulysses' tent, and call'd aloud.
Ulysses, sudden as the voice was sent,
Awakes, starts up, and issues from his tent.
"What new distress, what sudden cause of fright,
Thus leads you wandering in the silent night?"
"O prudent chief! (the Pylian sage replied)
Wise as thou art, be now thy wisdom tried:
Whatever means of safety can be sought,
Whatever counsels can inspire our thought,
Whatever methods, or to fly or fight;
All, all depend on this important night!"
He heard, return'd, and took his painted shield;
Then join'd the chiefs, and follow'd through the field.
Without his tent, bold Diomed they found,
All sheathed in arms, his brave companions round:
Each sunk in sleep, extended on the field,
His head reclining on his bossy shield.
A wood of spears stood by, that, fix'd upright,
Shot from their flashing points a quivering light.
A bull's black hide composed the hero's bed;
A splendid carpet roll'd beneath his head.
Then, with his foot, old Nestor gently shakes
The slumbering chief, and in these words awakes:

"Rise, son of Tydeus! to the brave and strong
Rest seems inglorious, and the night too long.
But sleep'st thou now, when from yon hill the foe
Hangs o'er the fleet, and shades our walls below?"

At this, soft slumber from his eyelids fled;
The warrior saw the hoary chief, and said:
"Wondrous old man! whose soul no respite knows,
Though years and honours bid thee seek repose,
Let younger Greeks our sleeping warriors wake;
Ill fits thy age these toils to undertake."
"My friend, (he answered,) generous is thy care;
These toils, my subjects and my sons might bear;
Their loyal thoughts and pious love conspire
To ease a sovereign and relieve a sire:
But now the last despair surrounds our host;
No hour must pass, no moment must be lost;
Each single Greek, in this conclusive strife,
Stands on the sharpest edge of death or life:
Yet, if my years thy kind regard engage,
Employ thy youth as I employ my age;
Succeed to these my cares, and rouse the rest;
He serves me most, who serves his country best."

This said, the hero o'er his shoulders flung
A lion's spoils, that to his ankles hung;
Then seized his ponderous lance, and strode along.
Meges the bold, with Ajax famed for speed,
The warrior roused, and to the entrenchments lead.

And now the chiefs approach the nightly guard;
A wakeful squadron, each in arms prepared:
The unwearied watch their listening leaders keep,
And, couching close, repel invading sleep.
So faithful dogs their fleecy charge maintain,
With toil protected from the prowling train;
When the gaunt lioness, with hunger bold,
Springs from the mountains toward the guarded fold:
Through breaking woods her rustling course they hear;
Loud, and more loud, the clamours strike their ear
Of hounds and men: they start, they gaze around,
Watch every side, and turn to every sound.
Thus watch'd the Grecians, cautious of surprise,
Each voice, each motion, drew their ears and eyes:
Each step of passing feet increased the affright;
And hostile Troy was ever full in sight.
Nestor with joy the wakeful band survey'd,
And thus accosted through the gloomy shade.
"'Tis well, my sons! your nightly cares employ;
Else must our host become the scorn of Troy.
Watch thus, and Greece shall live." The hero said;
Then o'er the trench the following chieftains led.
His son, and godlike Merion, march'd behind
(For these the princes to their council join'd).
The trenches pass'd, the assembled kings around
In silent state the consistory crown'd.
A place there was, yet undefiled with gore,
The spot where Hector stopp'd his rage before;
When night descending, from his vengeful hand
Reprieved the relics of the Grecian band:
(The plain beside with mangled corps was spread,
And all his progress mark'd by heaps of dead:)
There sat the mournful kings: when Neleus' son,
The council opening, in these words begun:

"Is there (said he) a chief so greatly brave,
His life to hazard, and his country save?
Lives there a man, who singly dares to go
To yonder camp, or seize some straggling foe?
Or favour'd by the night approach so near,
Their speech, their counsels, and designs to hear?
If to besiege our navies they prepare,
Or Troy once more must be the seat of war?
This could he learn, and to our peers recite,
And pass unharm'd the dangers of the night;
What fame were his through all succeeding days,
While Phoebus shines, or men have tongues to praise!
What gifts his grateful country would bestow!
What must not Greece to her deliverer owe?
A sable ewe each leader should provide,
With each a sable lambkin by her side;
At every rite his share should be increased,
And his the foremost honours of the feast."

Fear held them mute: alone, untaught to fear,
Tydides spoke--"The man you seek is here.
Through yon black camps to bend my dangerous way,
Some god within commands, and I obey.
But let some other chosen warrior join,
To raise my hopes, and second my design.
By mutual confidence and mutual aid,
Great deeds are done, and great discoveries made;
The wise new prudence from the wise acquire,
And one brave hero fans another's fire."

Contending leaders at the word arose;
Each generous breast with emulation glows;
So brave a task each Ajax strove to share,
Bold Merion strove, and Nestor's valiant heir;
The Spartan wish'd the second place to gain,
And great Ulysses wish'd, nor wish'd in vain.
Then thus the king of men the contest ends:
"Thou first of warriors, and thou best of friends,
Undaunted Diomed! what chief to join
In this great enterprise, is only thine.
Just be thy choice, without affection made;
To birth, or office, no respect be paid;
Let worth determine here." The monarch spake,
And inly trembled for his brother's sake.

"Then thus (the godlike Diomed rejoin'd)
My choice declares the impulse of my mind.
How can I doubt, while great Ulysses stands
To lend his counsels and assist our hands?
A chief, whose safety is Minerva's care;
So famed, so dreadful, in the works of war:
Bless'd in his conduct, I no aid require;
Wisdom like his might pass through flames of fire."

"It fits thee not, before these chiefs of fame,
(Replied the sage,) to praise me, or to blame:
Praise from a friend, or censure from a foe,
Are lost on hearers that our merits know.
But let us haste--Night rolls the hours away,
The reddening orient shows the coming day,
The stars shine fainter on the ethereal plains,
And of night's empire but a third remains."

Thus having spoke, with generous ardour press'd,
In arms terrific their huge limbs they dress'd.
A two-edged falchion Thrasymed the brave,
And ample buckler, to Tydides gave:
Then in a leathern helm he cased his head,
Short of its crest, and with no plume o'erspread:
(Such as by youths unused to arms are worn:)
No spoils enrich it, and no studs adorn.
Next him Ulysses took a shining sword,
A bow and quiver, with bright arrows stored:
A well-proved casque, with leather braces bound,
(Thy gift, Meriones,) his temples crown'd;
Soft wool within; without, in order spread,(217)
A boar's white teeth grinn'd horrid o'er his head.
This from Amyntor, rich Ormenus' son,
Autolycus by fraudful rapine won,
And gave Amphidamas; from him the prize
Molus received, the pledge of social ties;
The helmet next by Merion was possess'd,
And now Ulysses' thoughtful temples press'd.
Thus sheathed in arms, the council they forsake,
And dark through paths oblique their progress take.
Just then, in sign she favour'd their intent,
A long-wing'd heron great Minerva sent:
This, though surrounding shades obscured their view.
By the shrill clang and whistling wings they knew.
As from the right she soar'd, Ulysses pray'd,
Hail'd the glad omen, and address'd the maid:

"O daughter of that god whose arm can wield
The avenging bolt, and shake the dreadful shield!
O thou! for ever present in my way,
Who all my motions, all my toils survey!
Safe may we pass beneath the gloomy shade,
Safe by thy succour to our ships convey'd,
And let some deed this signal night adorn,
To claim the tears of Trojans yet unborn."

Then godlike Diomed preferr'd his prayer:
"Daughter of Jove, unconquer'd Pallas! hear.
Great queen of arms, whose favour Tydeus won,
As thou defend'st the sire, defend the son.
When on Ćsopus' banks the banded powers
Of Greece he left, and sought the Theban towers,
Peace was his charge; received with peaceful show,
He went a legate, but return'd a foe:
Then help'd by thee, and cover'd by thy shield,
He fought with numbers, and made numbers yield.
So now be present, O celestial maid!
So still continue to the race thine aid!
A youthful steer shall fall beneath the stroke,
Untamed, unconscious of the galling yoke,
With ample forehead, and with spreading horns,
Whose taper tops refulgent gold adorns."
The heroes pray'd, and Pallas from the skies
Accords their vow, succeeds their enterprise.
Now, like two lions panting for the prey,
With dreadful thoughts they trace the dreary way,
Through the black horrors of the ensanguined plain,
Through dust, through blood, o'er arms, and hills of slain.

Nor less bold Hector, and the sons of Troy,
On high designs the wakeful hours employ;
The assembled peers their lofty chief enclosed;
Who thus the counsels of his breast proposed:

"What glorious man, for high attempts prepared,
Dares greatly venture for a rich reward?
Of yonder fleet a bold discovery make,
What watch they keep, and what resolves they take?
If now subdued they meditate their flight,
And, spent with toil, neglect the watch of night?
His be the chariot that shall please him most,
Of all the plunder of the vanquish'd host;
His the fair steeds that all the rest excel,
And his the glory to have served so well."

A youth there was among the tribes of Troy,
Dolon his name, Eumedes' only boy,
(Five girls beside the reverend herald told.)
Rich was the son in brass, and rich in gold;
Not bless'd by nature with the charms of face,
But swift of foot, and matchless in the race.
"Hector! (he said) my courage bids me meet
This high achievement, and explore the fleet:
But first exalt thy sceptre to the skies,
And swear to grant me the demanded prize;
The immortal coursers, and the glittering car,
That bear Pelides through the ranks of war.
Encouraged thus, no idle scout I go,
Fulfil thy wish, their whole intention know,
Even to the royal tent pursue my way,
And all their counsels, all their aims betray."

The chief then heaved the golden sceptre high,
Attesting thus the monarch of the sky:
"Be witness thou! immortal lord of all!
Whose thunder shakes the dark aerial hall:
By none but Dolon shall this prize be borne,
And him alone the immortal steeds adorn."

Thus Hector swore: the gods were call'd in vain,
But the rash youth prepares to scour the plain:
Across his back the bended bow he flung,
A wolf's grey hide around his shoulders hung,
A ferret's downy fur his helmet lined,
And in his hand a pointed javelin shined.
Then (never to return) he sought the shore,
And trod the path his feet must tread no more.
Scarce had he pass'd the steeds and Trojan throng,
(Still bending forward as he coursed along,)
When, on the hollow way, the approaching tread
Ulysses mark'd, and thus to Diomed;

"O friend! I hear some step of hostile feet,
Moving this way, or hastening to the fleet;
Some spy, perhaps, to lurk beside the main;
Or nightly pillager that strips the slain.
Yet let him pass, and win a little space;
Then rush behind him, and prevent his pace.
But if too swift of foot he flies before,
Confine his course along the fleet and shore,
Betwixt the camp and him our spears employ,
And intercept his hoped return to Troy."

With that they stepp'd aside, and stoop'd their head,
(As Dolon pass'd,) behind a heap of dead:
Along the path the spy unwary flew;
Soft, at just distance, both the chiefs pursue.
So distant they, and such the space between,
As when two teams of mules divide the green,
(To whom the hind like shares of land allows,)
When now new furrows part the approaching ploughs.
Now Dolon, listening, heard them as they pass'd;
Hector (he thought) had sent, and check'd his haste,
Till scarce at distance of a javelin's throw,
No voice succeeding, he perceived the foe.
As when two skilful hounds the leveret wind;
Or chase through woods obscure the trembling hind;
Now lost, now seen, they intercept his way,
And from the herd still turn the flying prey:
So fast, and with such fears, the Trojan flew;
So close, so constant, the bold Greeks pursue.
Now almost on the fleet the dastard falls,
And mingles with the guards that watch the walls;
When brave Tydides stopp'd; a gen'rous thought
(Inspired by Pallas) in his bosom wrought,
Lest on the foe some forward Greek advance,
And snatch the glory from his lifted lance.
Then thus aloud: "Whoe'er thou art, remain;
This javelin else shall fix thee to the plain."
He said, and high in air the weapon cast,
Which wilful err'd, and o'er his shoulder pass'd;
Then fix'd in earth. Against the trembling wood
The wretch stood propp'd, and quiver'd as he stood;
A sudden palsy seized his turning head;
His loose teeth chatter'd, and his colour fled;
The panting warriors seize him as he stands,
And with unmanly tears his life demands.

"O spare my youth, and for the breath I owe,
Large gifts of price my father shall bestow:
Vast heaps of brass shall in your ships be told,
And steel well-temper'd and refulgent gold."

To whom Ulysses made this wise reply:
"Whoe'er thou art, be bold, nor fear to die.
What moves thee, say, when sleep has closed the sight,
To roam the silent fields in dead of night?
Cam'st thou the secrets of our camp to find,
By Hector prompted, or thy daring mind?
Or art some wretch by hopes of plunder led,
Through heaps of carnage, to despoil the dead?"

Then thus pale Dolon, with a fearful look:
(Still, as he spoke, his limbs with horror shook:)
"Hither I came, by Hector's words deceived;
Much did he promise, rashly I believed:
No less a bribe than great Achilles' car,
And those swift steeds that sweep the ranks of war,
Urged me, unwilling, this attempt to make;
To learn what counsels, what resolves you take:
If now subdued, you fix your hopes on flight,
And, tired with toils, neglect the watch of night."

"Bold was thy aim, and glorious was the prize,
(Ulysses, with a scornful smile, replies,)
Far other rulers those proud steeds demand,
And scorn the guidance of a vulgar hand;
Even great Achilles scarce their rage can tame,
Achilles sprung from an immortal dame.
But say, be faithful, and the truth recite!
Where lies encamp'd the Trojan chief to-night?
Where stand his coursers? in what quarter sleep
Their other princes? tell what watch they keep:
Say, since this conquest, what their counsels are;
Or here to combat, from their city far,
Or back to Ilion's walls transfer the war?"

Ulysses thus, and thus Eumedes' son:
"What Dolon knows, his faithful tongue shall own.
Hector, the peers assembling in his tent,
A council holds at Ilus' monument.
No certain guards the nightly watch partake;
Where'er yon fires ascend, the Trojans wake:
Anxious for Troy, the guard the natives keep;
Safe in their cares, the auxiliar forces sleep,
Whose wives and infants, from the danger far,
Discharge their souls of half the fears of war."

"Then sleep those aids among the Trojan train,
(Inquired the chief,) or scattered o'er the plain?"
To whom the spy: "Their powers they thus dispose
The Paeons, dreadful with their bended bows,
The Carians, Caucons, the Pelasgian host,
And Leleges, encamp along the coast.
Not distant far, lie higher on the land
The Lycian, Mysian, and Maeonian band,
And Phrygia's horse, by Thymbras' ancient wall;
The Thracians utmost, and apart from all.
These Troy but lately to her succour won,
Led on by Rhesus, great Eioneus' son:
I saw his coursers in proud triumph go,
Swift as the wind, and white as winter-snow;
Rich silver plates his shining car infold;
His solid arms, refulgent, flame with gold;
No mortal shoulders suit the glorious load,
Celestial panoply, to grace a god!
Let me, unhappy, to your fleet be borne,
Or leave me here, a captive's fate to mourn,
In cruel chains, till your return reveal
The truth or falsehood of the news I tell."

To this Tydides, with a gloomy frown:
"Think not to live, though all the truth be shown:
Shall we dismiss thee, in some future strife
To risk more bravely thy now forfeit life?
Or that again our camps thou may'st explore?
No--once a traitor, thou betray'st no more."

Sternly he spoke, and as the wretch prepared
With humble blandishment to stroke his beard,
Like lightning swift the wrathful falchion flew,
Divides the neck, and cuts the nerves in two;
One instant snatch'd his trembling soul to hell,
The head, yet speaking, mutter'd as it fell.
The furry helmet from his brow they tear,
The wolf's grey hide, the unbended bow and spear;
These great Ulysses lifting to the skies,
To favouring Pallas dedicates the prize:

"Great queen of arms, receive this hostile spoil,
And let the Thracian steeds reward our toil;
Thee, first of all the heavenly host, we praise;
O speed our labours, and direct our ways!"
This said, the spoils, with dropping gore defaced,
High on a spreading tamarisk he placed;
Then heap'd with reeds and gathered boughs the plain,
To guide their footsteps to the place again.

Through the still night they cross the devious fields,
Slippery with blood, o'er arms and heaps of shields,
Arriving where the Thracian squadrons lay,
And eased in sleep the labours of the day.
Ranged in three lines they view the prostrate band:
The horses yoked beside each warrior stand.
Their arms in order on the ground reclined,
Through the brown shade the fulgid weapons shined:
Amidst lay Rhesus, stretch'd in sleep profound,
And the white steeds behind his chariot bound.
The welcome sight Ulysses first descries,
And points to Diomed the tempting prize.
"The man, the coursers, and the car behold!
Described by Dolon, with the arms of gold.
Now, brave Tydides! now thy courage try,
Approach the chariot, and the steeds untie;
Or if thy soul aspire to fiercer deeds,
Urge thou the slaughter, while I seize the steeds."

Pallas (this said) her hero's bosom warms,
Breathed in his heart, and strung his nervous arms;
Where'er he pass'd, a purple stream pursued
His thirsty falchion, fat with hostile blood,
Bathed all his footsteps, dyed the fields with gore,
And a low groan remurmur'd through the shore.
So the grim lion, from his nightly den,
O'erleaps the fences, and invades the pen,
On sheep or goats, resistless in his way,
He falls, and foaming rends the guardless prey;
Nor stopp'd the fury of his vengeful hand,
Till twelve lay breathless of the Thracian band.
Ulysses following, as his partner slew,
Back by the foot each slaughter'd warrior drew;
The milk-white coursers studious to convey
Safe to the ships, he wisely cleared the way:
Lest the fierce steeds, not yet to battles bred,
Should start, and tremble at the heaps of dead.
Now twelve despatch'd, the monarch last they found;
Tydides' falchion fix'd him to the ground.
Just then a deathful dream Minerva sent,
A warlike form appear'd before his tent,
Whose visionary steel his bosom tore:
So dream'd the monarch, and awaked no more.(218)

Ulysses now the snowy steeds detains,
And leads them, fasten'd by the silver reins;
These, with his bow unbent, he lash'd along;
(The scourge forgot, on Rhesus' chariot hung;)
Then gave his friend the signal to retire;
But him, new dangers, new achievements fire;
Doubtful he stood, or with his reeking blade
To send more heroes to the infernal shade,
Drag off the car where Rhesus' armour lay,
Or heave with manly force, and lift away.
While unresolved the son of Tydeus stands,
Pallas appears, and thus her chief commands:

"Enough, my son; from further slaughter cease,
Regard thy safety, and depart in peace;
Haste to the ships, the gotten spoils enjoy,
Nor tempt too far the hostile gods of Troy."

The voice divine confess'd the martial maid;
In haste he mounted, and her word obey'd;
The coursers fly before Ulysses' bow,
Swift as the wind, and white as winter-snow.

Not unobserved they pass'd: the god of light
Had watch'd his Troy, and mark'd Minerva's flight,
Saw Tydeus' son with heavenly succour bless'd,
And vengeful anger fill'd his sacred breast.
Swift to the Trojan camp descends the power,
And wakes Hippocoon in the morning-hour;
(On Rhesus' side accustom'd to attend,
A faithful kinsman, and instructive friend;)
He rose, and saw the field deform'd with blood,
An empty space where late the coursers stood,
The yet-warm Thracians panting on the coast;
For each he wept, but for his Rhesus most:
Now while on Rhesus' name he calls in vain,
The gathering tumult spreads o'er all the plain;
On heaps the Trojans rush, with wild affright,
And wondering view the slaughters of the night.

Meanwhile the chiefs, arriving at the shade
Where late the spoils of Hector's spy were laid,
Ulysses stopp'd; to him Tydides bore
The trophy, dropping yet with Dolon's gore:
Then mounts again; again their nimbler feet
The coursers ply, and thunder towards the fleet.

[Illustration: DIOMED AND ULYSSES RETURNING WITH THE SPOILS OF RHESUS.]

       DIOMED AND ULYSSES RETURNING WITH THE SPOILS OF RHESUS.


Old Nestor first perceived the approaching sound,
Bespeaking thus the Grecian peers around:
"Methinks the noise of trampling steeds I hear,
Thickening this way, and gathering on my ear;
Perhaps some horses of the Trojan breed
(So may, ye gods! my pious hopes succeed)
The great Tydides and Ulysses bear,
Return'd triumphant with this prize of war.
Yet much I fear (ah, may that fear be vain!)
The chiefs outnumber'd by the Trojan train;
Perhaps, even now pursued, they seek the shore;
Or, oh! perhaps those heroes are no more."

Scarce had he spoke, when, lo! the chiefs appear,
And spring to earth; the Greeks dismiss their fear:
With words of friendship and extended hands
They greet the kings; and Nestor first demands:

"Say thou, whose praises all our host proclaim,
Thou living glory of the Grecian name!
Say whence these coursers? by what chance bestow'd,
The spoil of foes, or present of a god?
Not those fair steeds, so radiant and so gay,
That draw the burning chariot of the day.
Old as I am, to age I scorn to yield,
And daily mingle in the martial field;
But sure till now no coursers struck my sight
Like these, conspicuous through the ranks of fight.
Some god, I deem, conferred the glorious prize,
Bless'd as ye are, and favourites of the skies;
The care of him who bids the thunder roar,
And her, whose fury bathes the world with gore."

"Father! not so, (sage Ithacus rejoin'd,)
The gifts of heaven are of a nobler kind.
Of Thracian lineage are the steeds ye view,
Whose hostile king the brave Tydides slew;
Sleeping he died, with all his guards around,
And twelve beside lay gasping on the ground.
These other spoils from conquer'd Dolon came,
A wretch, whose swiftness was his only fame;
By Hector sent our forces to explore,
He now lies headless on the sandy shore."

Then o'er the trench the bounding coursers flew;
The joyful Greeks with loud acclaim pursue.
Straight to Tydides' high pavilion borne,
The matchless steeds his ample stalls adorn:
The neighing coursers their new fellows greet,
And the full racks are heap'd with generous wheat.
But Dolon's armour, to his ships convey'd,
High on the painted stern Ulysses laid,
A trophy destin'd to the blue-eyed maid.

Now from nocturnal sweat and sanguine stain
They cleanse their bodies in the neighb'ring main:
Then in the polished bath, refresh'd from toil,
Their joints they supple with dissolving oil,
In due repast indulge the genial hour,
And first to Pallas the libations pour:
They sit, rejoicing in her aid divine,
And the crown'd goblet foams with floods of wine.





BOOK XI.


ARGUMENT

THE THIRD BATTLE, AND THE ACTS OF AGAMEMNON.

Agamemnon, having armed himself, leads the Grecians to battle; Hector
prepares the Trojans to receive them, while Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva
give the signals of war. Agamemnon bears all before him and Hector is
commanded by Jupiter (who sends Iris for that purpose) to decline the
engagement, till the king shall be wounded and retire from the field. He
then makes a great slaughter of the enemy. Ulysses and Diomed put a stop
to him for a time but the latter, being wounded by Paris, is obliged to
desert his companion, who is encompassed by the Trojans, wounded, and in
the utmost danger, till Menelaus and Ajax rescue him. Hector comes against
Ajax, but that hero alone opposes multitudes, and rallies the Greeks. In
the meantime Machaon, in the other wing of the army, is pierced with an
arrow by Paris, and carried from the fight in Nestor's chariot. Achilles
(who overlooked the action from his ship) sent Patroclus to inquire which
of the Greeks was wounded in that manner; Nestor entertains him in his
tent with an account of the accidents of the day, and a long recital of
some former wars which he remembered, tending to put Patroclus upon
persuading Achilles to fight for his countrymen, or at least to permit him
to do it, clad in Achilles' armour. Patroclus, on his return, meets
Eurypylus also wounded, and assists him in that distress.

This book opens with the eight and-twentieth day of the poem, and the same
day, with its various actions and adventures is extended through the
twelfth, thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth, seventeenth, and
part of the eighteenth books. The scene lies in the field near the
monument of Ilus.

The saffron morn, with early blushes spread,(219)
Now rose refulgent from Tithonus' bed;
With new-born day to gladden mortal sight,
And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light:
When baleful Eris, sent by Jove's command,
The torch of discord blazing in her hand,
Through the red skies her bloody sign extends,
And, wrapt in tempests, o'er the fleet descends.
High on Ulysses' bark her horrid stand
She took, and thunder'd through the seas and land.

Even Ajax and Achilles heard the sound,
Whose ships, remote, the guarded navy bound,
Thence the black fury through the Grecian throng
With horror sounds the loud Orthian song:
The navy shakes, and at the dire alarms
Each bosom boils, each warrior starts to arms.
No more they sigh, inglorious to return,
But breathe revenge, and for the combat burn.

               [Illustration: THE DESCENT OF DISCORD.]

                       THE DESCENT OF DISCORD.


The king of men his hardy host inspires
With loud command, with great example fires!
Himself first rose, himself before the rest
His mighty limbs in radiant armour dress'd,
And first he cased his manly legs around
In shining greaves with silver buckles bound;
The beaming cuirass next adorn'd his breast,
The same which once king Cinyras possess'd:
(The fame of Greece and her assembled host
Had reach'd that monarch on the Cyprian coast;
'Twas then, the friendship of the chief to gain,
This glorious gift he sent, nor sent in vain:)
Ten rows of azure steel the work infold,
Twice ten of tin, and twelve of ductile gold;
Three glittering dragons to the gorget rise,
Whose imitated scales against the skies
Reflected various light, and arching bow'd,
Like colour'd rainbows o'er a showery cloud
(Jove's wondrous bow, of three celestial dies,
Placed as a sign to man amidst the skies).
A radiant baldric, o'er his shoulder tied,
Sustain'd the sword that glitter'd at his side:
Gold was the hilt, a silver sheath encased
The shining blade, and golden hangers graced.
His buckler's mighty orb was next display'd,
That round the warrior cast a dreadful shade;
Ten zones of brass its ample brim surround,
And twice ten bosses the bright convex crown'd:
Tremendous Gorgon frown'd upon its field,
And circling terrors fill'd the expressive shield:
Within its concave hung a silver thong,
On which a mimic serpent creeps along,
His azure length in easy waves extends,
Till in three heads the embroider'd monster ends.
Last o'er his brows his fourfold helm he placed,
With nodding horse-hair formidably graced;
And in his hands two steely javelins wields,
That blaze to heaven, and lighten all the fields.

That instant Juno, and the martial maid,
In happy thunders promised Greece their aid;
High o'er the chief they clash'd their arms in air,
And, leaning from the clouds, expect the war.

Close to the limits of the trench and mound,
The fiery coursers to their chariots bound
The squires restrain'd: the foot, with those who wield
The lighter arms, rush forward to the field.
To second these, in close array combined,
The squadrons spread their sable wings behind.
Now shouts and tumults wake the tardy sun,
As with the light the warriors' toils begun.
Even Jove, whose thunder spoke his wrath, distill'd
Red drops of blood o'er all the fatal field;(220)
The woes of men unwilling to survey,
And all the slaughters that must stain the day.

Near Ilus' tomb, in order ranged around,
The Trojan lines possess'd the rising ground:
There wise Polydamas and Hector stood;
Ćneas, honour'd as a guardian god;
Bold Polybus, Agenor the divine;
The brother-warriors of Antenor's line:
With youthful Acamas, whose beauteous face
And fair proportion match'd the ethereal race.
Great Hector, cover'd with his spacious shield,
Plies all the troops, and orders all the field.
As the red star now shows his sanguine fires
Through the dark clouds, and now in night retires,
Thus through the ranks appear'd the godlike man,
Plunged in the rear, or blazing in the van;
While streamy sparkles, restless as he flies,
Flash from his arms, as lightning from the skies.
As sweating reapers in some wealthy field,
Ranged in two bands, their crooked weapons wield,
Bear down the furrows, till their labours meet;
Thick fall the heapy harvests at their feet:
So Greece and Troy the field of war divide,
And falling ranks are strow'd on every side.
None stoop'd a thought to base inglorious flight;(221)
But horse to horse, and man to man they fight,
Not rabid wolves more fierce contest their prey;
Each wounds, each bleeds, but none resign the day.
Discord with joy the scene of death descries,
And drinks large slaughter at her sanguine eyes:
Discord alone, of all the immortal train,
Swells the red horrors of this direful plain:
The gods in peace their golden mansions fill,
Ranged in bright order on the Olympian hill:
But general murmurs told their griefs above,
And each accused the partial will of Jove.
Meanwhile apart, superior, and alone,
The eternal Monarch, on his awful throne,
Wrapt in the blaze of boundless glory sate;
And fix'd, fulfill'd the just decrees of fate.
On earth he turn'd his all-considering eyes,
And mark'd the spot where Ilion's towers arise;
The sea with ships, the fields with armies spread,
The victor's rage, the dying, and the dead.

Thus while the morning-beams, increasing bright,
O'er heaven's pure azure spread the glowing light,
Commutual death the fate of war confounds,
Each adverse battle gored with equal wounds.
But now (what time in some sequester'd vale
The weary woodman spreads his sparing meal,
When his tired arms refuse the axe to rear,
And claim a respite from the sylvan war;
But not till half the prostrate forests lay
Stretch'd in long ruin, and exposed to day)
Then, nor till then, the Greeks' impulsive might
Pierced the black phalanx, and let in the light.
Great Agamemnon then the slaughter led,
And slew Bienor at his people's head:
Whose squire Oileus, with a sudden spring,
Leap'd from the chariot to revenge his king;
But in his front he felt the fatal wound,
Which pierced his brain, and stretch'd him on the ground.
Atrides spoil'd, and left them on the plain:
Vain was their youth, their glittering armour vain:
Now soil'd with dust, and naked to the sky,
Their snowy limbs and beauteous bodies lie.

Two sons of Priam next to battle move,
The product, one of marriage, one of love:(222)
In the same car the brother-warriors ride;
This took the charge to combat, that to guide:
Far other task, than when they wont to keep,
On Ida's tops, their father's fleecy sheep.
These on the mountains once Achilles found,
And captive led, with pliant osiers bound;
Then to their sire for ample sums restored;
But now to perish by Atrides' sword:
Pierced in the breast the base-born Isus bleeds:
Cleft through the head his brother's fate succeeds,
Swift to the spoil the hasty victor falls,
And, stript, their features to his mind recalls.
The Trojans see the youths untimely die,
But helpless tremble for themselves, and fly.
So when a lion ranging o'er the lawns.
Finds, on some grassy lair, the couching fawns,
Their bones he cracks, their reeking vitals draws,
And grinds the quivering flesh with bloody jaws;
The frighted hind beholds, and dares not stay,
But swift through rustling thickets bursts her way;
All drown'd in sweat, the panting mother flies,
And the big tears roll trickling from her eyes.

Amidst the tumult of the routed train,
The sons of false Antimachus were slain;
He who for bribes his faithless counsels sold,
And voted Helen's stay for Paris' gold.
Atrides mark'd, as these their safety sought,
And slew the children for the father's fault;
Their headstrong horse unable to restrain,
They shook with fear, and dropp'd the silken rein;
Then in the chariot on their knees they fall,
And thus with lifted hands for mercy call:

"O spare our youth, and for the life we owe,
Antimachus shall copious gifts bestow:
Soon as he hears, that, not in battle slain,
The Grecian ships his captive sons detain,
Large heaps of brass in ransom shall be told,
And steel well-tempered, and persuasive gold."

These words, attended with the flood of tears,
The youths address'd to unrelenting ears:
The vengeful monarch gave this stern reply:
"If from Antimachus ye spring, ye die;
The daring wretch who once in council stood
To shed Ulysses' and my brother's blood,
For proffer'd peace! and sues his seed for grace?
No, die, and pay the forfeit of your race."

This said, Pisander from the car he cast,
And pierced his breast: supine he breathed his last.
His brother leap'd to earth; but, as he lay,
The trenchant falchion lopp'd his hands away;
His sever'd head was toss'd among the throng,
And, rolling, drew a bloody train along.
Then, where the thickest fought, the victor flew;
The king's example all his Greeks pursue.
Now by the foot the flying foot were slain,
Horse trod by horse, lay foaming on the plain.
From the dry fields thick clouds of dust arise,
Shade the black host, and intercept the skies.
The brass-hoof'd steeds tumultuous plunge and bound,
And the thick thunder beats the labouring ground,
Still slaughtering on, the king of men proceeds;
The distanced army wonders at his deeds,
As when the winds with raging flames conspire,
And o'er the forests roll the flood of fire,
In blazing heaps the grove's old honours fall,
And one refulgent ruin levels all:
Before Atrides' rage so sinks the foe,
Whole squadrons vanish, and proud heads lie low.
The steeds fly trembling from his waving sword,
And many a car, now lighted of its lord,
Wide o'er the field with guideless fury rolls,
Breaking their ranks, and crushing out their souls;
While his keen falchion drinks the warriors' lives;
More grateful, now, to vultures than their wives!

Perhaps great Hector then had found his fate,
But Jove and destiny prolong'd his date.
Safe from the darts, the care of heaven he stood,
Amidst alarms, and death, and dust, and blood.

Now past the tomb where ancient Ilus lay,
Through the mid field the routed urge their way:
Where the wild figs the adjoining summit crown,
The path they take, and speed to reach the town.
As swift, Atrides with loud shouts pursued,
Hot with his toil, and bathed in hostile blood.
Now near the beech-tree, and the Scaean gates,
The hero halts, and his associates waits.
Meanwhile on every side around the plain,
Dispersed, disorder'd, fly the Trojan train.
So flies a herd of beeves, that hear dismay'd
The lion's roaring through the midnight shade;
On heaps they tumble with successless haste;
The savage seizes, draws, and rends the last.
Not with less fury stern Atrides flew,
Still press'd the rout, and still the hindmost slew;
Hurl'd from their cars the bravest chiefs are kill'd,
And rage, and death, and carnage load the field.

Now storms the victor at the Trojan wall;
Surveys the towers, and meditates their fall.
But Jove descending shook the Idaean hills,
And down their summits pour'd a hundred rills:
The unkindled lightning in his hand he took,
And thus the many-coloured maid bespoke:

"Iris, with haste thy golden wings display,
To godlike Hector this our word convey--
While Agamemnon wastes the ranks around,
Fights in the front, and bathes with blood the ground,
Bid him give way; but issue forth commands,
And trust the war to less important hands:
But when, or wounded by the spear or dart,
That chief shall mount his chariot, and depart,
Then Jove shall string his arm, and fire his breast,
Then to her ships shall flying Greece be press'd,
Till to the main the burning sun descend,
And sacred night her awful shade extend."

He spoke, and Iris at his word obey'd;
On wings of winds descends the various maid.
The chief she found amidst the ranks of war,
Close to the bulwarks, on his glittering car.
The goddess then: "O son of Priam, hear!
From Jove I come, and his high mandate bear.
While Agamemnon wastes the ranks around,
Fights in the front, and bathes with blood the ground,
Abstain from fight; yet issue forth commands,
And trust the war to less important hands:
But when, or wounded by the spear or dart,
The chief shall mount his chariot, and depart,
Then Jove shall string thy arm, and fire thy breast,
Then to her ships shall flying Greece be press'd,
Till to the main the burning sun descend,
And sacred night her awful shade extend."

She said, and vanish'd. Hector, with a bound,
Springs from his chariot on the trembling ground,
In clanging arms: he grasps in either hand
A pointed lance, and speeds from band to band;
Revives their ardour, turns their steps from flight,
And wakes anew the dying flames of fight.
They stand to arms: the Greeks their onset dare,
Condense their powers, and wait the coming war.
New force, new spirit, to each breast returns;
The fight renew'd with fiercer fury burns:
The king leads on: all fix on him their eye,
And learn from him to conquer, or to die.

Ye sacred nine! celestial Muses! tell,
Who faced him first, and by his prowess fell?
The great Iphidamas, the bold and young,
From sage Antenor and Theano sprung;
Whom from his youth his grandsire Cisseus bred,
And nursed in Thrace where snowy flocks are fed.
Scarce did the down his rosy cheeks invest,
And early honour warm his generous breast,
When the kind sire consign'd his daughter's charms
(Theano's sister) to his youthful arms.
But call'd by glory to the wars of Troy,
He leaves untasted the first fruits of joy;
From his loved bride departs with melting eyes,
And swift to aid his dearer country flies.
With twelve black ships he reach'd Percope's strand,
Thence took the long laborious march by land.
Now fierce for fame, before the ranks he springs,
Towering in arms, and braves the king of kings.
Atrides first discharged the missive spear;
The Trojan stoop'd, the javelin pass'd in air.
Then near the corslet, at the monarch's heart,
With all his strength, the youth directs his dart:
But the broad belt, with plates of silver bound,
The point rebated, and repell'd the wound.
Encumber'd with the dart, Atrides stands,
Till, grasp'd with force, he wrench'd it from his hands;
At once his weighty sword discharged a wound
Full on his neck, that fell'd him to the ground.
Stretch'd in the dust the unhappy warrior lies,
And sleep eternal seals his swimming eyes.
Oh worthy better fate! oh early slain!
Thy country's friend; and virtuous, though in vain!
No more the youth shall join his consort's side,
At once a virgin, and at once a bride!
No more with presents her embraces meet,
Or lay the spoils of conquest at her feet,
On whom his passion, lavish of his store,
Bestow'd so much, and vainly promised more!
Unwept, uncover'd, on the plain he lay,
While the proud victor bore his arms away.

Coon, Antenor's eldest hope, was nigh:
Tears, at the sight, came starting from his eye,
While pierced with grief the much-loved youth he view'd,
And the pale features now deform'd with blood.
Then, with his spear, unseen, his time he took,
Aim'd at the king, and near his elbow strook.
The thrilling steel transpierced the brawny part,
And through his arm stood forth the barbed dart.
Surprised the monarch feels, yet void of fear
On Coon rushes with his lifted spear:
His brother's corpse the pious Trojan draws,
And calls his country to assert his cause;
Defends him breathless on the sanguine field,
And o'er the body spreads his ample shield.
Atrides, marking an unguarded part,
Transfix'd the warrior with his brazen dart;
Prone on his brother's bleeding breast he lay,
The monarch's falchion lopp'd his head away:
The social shades the same dark journey go,
And join each other in the realms below.

The vengeful victor rages round the fields,
With every weapon art or fury yields:
By the long lance, the sword, or ponderous stone,
Whole ranks are broken, and whole troops o'erthrown.
This, while yet warm distill'd the purple flood;
But when the wound grew stiff with clotted blood,
Then grinding tortures his strong bosom rend,
Less keen those darts the fierce Ilythiae send:
(The powers that cause the teeming matron's throes,
Sad mothers of unutterable woes!)
Stung with the smart, all-panting with the pain,
He mounts the car, and gives his squire the rein;
Then with a voice which fury made more strong,
And pain augmented, thus exhorts the throng:

"O friends! O Greeks! assert your honours won;
Proceed, and finish what this arm begun:
Lo! angry Jove forbids your chief to stay,
And envies half the glories of the day."

He said: the driver whirls his lengthful thong;
The horses fly; the chariot smokes along.
Clouds from their nostrils the fierce coursers blow,
And from their sides the foam descends in snow;
Shot through the battle in a moment's space,
The wounded monarch at his tent they place.

No sooner Hector saw the king retired,
But thus his Trojans and his aids he fired:
"Hear, all ye Dardan, all ye Lycian race!
Famed in close fight, and dreadful face to face:
Now call to mind your ancient trophies won,
Your great forefathers' virtues, and your own.
Behold, the general flies! deserts his powers!
Lo, Jove himself declares the conquest ours!
Now on yon ranks impel your foaming steeds;
And, sure of glory, dare immortal deeds."

With words like these the fiery chief alarms
His fainting host, and every bosom warms.
As the bold hunter cheers his hounds to tear
The brindled lion, or the tusky bear:
With voice and hand provokes their doubting heart,
And springs the foremost with his lifted dart:
So godlike Hector prompts his troops to dare;
Nor prompts alone, but leads himself the war.
On the black body of the foe he pours;
As from the cloud's deep bosom, swell'd with showers,
A sudden storm the purple ocean sweeps,
Drives the wild waves, and tosses all the deeps.
Say, Muse! when Jove the Trojan's glory crown'd,
Beneath his arm what heroes bit the ground?
Assaeus, Dolops, and Autonous died,
Opites next was added to their side;
Then brave Hipponous, famed in many a fight,
Opheltius, Orus, sunk to endless night;
Ćsymnus, Agelaus; all chiefs of name;
The rest were vulgar deaths unknown to fame.
As when a western whirlwind, charged with storms,
Dispels the gather'd clouds that Notus forms:
The gust continued, violent and strong,
Rolls sable clouds in heaps on heaps along;
Now to the skies the foaming billows rears,
Now breaks the surge, and wide the bottom bares:
Thus, raging Hector, with resistless hands,
O'erturns, confounds, and scatters all their bands.
Now the last ruin the whole host appals;
Now Greece had trembled in her wooden walls;
But wise Ulysses call'd Tydides forth,
His soul rekindled, and awaked his worth.
"And stand we deedless, O eternal shame!
Till Hector's arm involve the ships in flame?
Haste, let us join, and combat side by side."
The warrior thus, and thus the friend replied:

"No martial toil I shun, no danger fear;
Let Hector come; I wait his fury here.
But Jove with conquest crowns the Trojan train:
And, Jove our foe, all human force is vain."

He sigh'd; but, sighing, raised his vengeful steel,
And from his car the proud Thymbraeus fell:
Molion, the charioteer, pursued his lord,
His death ennobled by Ulysses' sword.
There slain, they left them in eternal night,
Then plunged amidst the thickest ranks of fight.
So two wild boars outstrip the following hounds,
Then swift revert, and wounds return for wounds.
Stern Hector's conquests in the middle plain
Stood check'd awhile, and Greece respired again.

The sons of Merops shone amidst the war;
Towering they rode in one refulgent car:
In deep prophetic arts their father skill'd,
Had warn'd his children from the Trojan field.
Fate urged them on: the father warn'd in vain;
They rush'd to fight, and perish'd on the plain;
Their breasts no more the vital spirit warms;
The stern Tydides strips their shining arms.
Hypirochus by great Ulysses dies,
And rich Hippodamus becomes his prize.
Great Jove from Ide with slaughter fills his sight,
And level hangs the doubtful scale of fight.
By Tydeus' lance Agastrophus was slain,
The far-famed hero of Paeonian strain;
Wing'd with his fears, on foot he strove to fly,
His steeds too distant, and the foe too nigh:
Through broken orders, swifter than the wind,
He fled, but flying left his life behind.
This Hector sees, as his experienced eyes
Traverse the files, and to the rescue flies;
Shouts, as he pass'd, the crystal regions rend,
And moving armies on his march attend.
Great Diomed himself was seized with fear,
And thus bespoke his brother of the war:

"Mark how this way yon bending squadrons yield!
The storm rolls on, and Hector rules the field:
Here stand his utmost force."--The warrior said;
Swift at the word his ponderous javelin fled;
Nor miss'd its aim, but where the plumage danced
Razed the smooth cone, and thence obliquely glanced.
Safe in his helm (the gift of Phoebus' hands)
Without a wound the Trojan hero stands;
But yet so stunn'd, that, staggering on the plain.
His arm and knee his sinking bulk sustain;
O'er his dim sight the misty vapours rise,
And a short darkness shades his swimming eyes.
Tydides followed to regain his lance;
While Hector rose, recover'd from the trance,
Remounts his car, and herds amidst the crowd:
The Greek pursues him, and exults aloud:
"Once more thank Phoebus for thy forfeit breath,
Or thank that swiftness which outstrips the death.
Well by Apollo are thy prayers repaid,
And oft that partial power has lent his aid.
Thou shall not long the death deserved withstand,
If any god assist Tydides' hand.
Fly then, inglorious! but thy flight, this day,
Whole hecatombs of Trojan ghosts shall pay,"

Him, while he triumph'd, Paris eyed from far,
(The spouse of Helen, the fair cause of war;)
Around the fields his feather'd shafts he sent,
From ancient Ilus' ruin'd monument:
Behind the column placed, he bent his bow,
And wing'd an arrow at the unwary foe;
Just as he stoop'd, Agastrophus's crest
To seize, and drew the corslet from his breast,
The bowstring twang'd; nor flew the shaft in vain,
But pierced his foot, and nail'd it to the plain.
The laughing Trojan, with a joyful spring.
Leaps from his ambush, and insults the king.

"He bleeds! (he cries) some god has sped my dart!
Would the same god had fix'd it in his heart!
So Troy, relieved from that wide-wasting hand,
Should breathe from slaughter and in combat stand:
Whose sons now tremble at his darted spear,
As scatter'd lambs the rushing lion fear."

He dauntless thus: "Thou conqueror of the fair,
Thou woman-warrior with the curling hair;
Vain archer! trusting to the distant dart,
Unskill'd in arms to act a manly part!
Thou hast but done what boys or women can;
Such hands may wound, but not incense a man.
Nor boast the scratch thy feeble arrow gave,
A coward's weapon never hurts the brave.
Not so this dart, which thou may'st one day feel;
Fate wings its flight, and death is on the steel:
Where this but lights, some noble life expires;
Its touch makes orphans, bathes the cheeks of sires,
Steeps earth in purple, gluts the birds of air,
And leaves such objects as distract the fair."
Ulysses hastens with a trembling heart,
Before him steps, and bending draws the dart:
Forth flows the blood; an eager pang succeeds;
Tydides mounts, and to the navy speeds.

Now on the field Ulysses stands alone,
The Greeks all fled, the Trojans pouring on;
But stands collected in himself, and whole,
And questions thus his own unconquer'd soul:

"What further subterfuge, what hopes remain?
What shame, inglorious if I quit the plain?
What danger, singly if I stand the ground,
My friends all scatter'd, all the foes around?
Yet wherefore doubtful? let this truth suffice,
The brave meets danger, and the coward flies.
To die or conquer, proves a hero's heart;
And, knowing this, I know a soldier's part."

Such thoughts revolving in his careful breast,
Near, and more near, the shady cohorts press'd;
These, in the warrior, their own fate enclose;
And round him deep the steely circle grows.
So fares a boar whom all the troop surrounds
Of shouting huntsmen and of clamorous hounds;
He grinds his ivory tusks; he foams with ire;
His sanguine eye-balls glare with living fire;
By these, by those, on every part is plied;
And the red slaughter spreads on every side.
Pierced through the shoulder, first Deiopis fell;
Next Ennomus and Thoon sank to hell;
Chersidamas, beneath the navel thrust,
Falls prone to earth, and grasps the bloody dust.
Charops, the son of Hippasus, was near;
Ulysses reach'd him with the fatal spear;
But to his aid his brother Socus flies,
Socus the brave, the generous, and the wise.
Near as he drew, the warrior thus began:

"O great Ulysses! much-enduring man!
Not deeper skill'd in every martial sleight,
Than worn to toils, and active in the fight!
This day two brothers shall thy conquest grace,
And end at once the great Hippasian race,
Or thou beneath this lance must press the field."
He said, and forceful pierced his spacious shield:
Through the strong brass the ringing javelin thrown,
Plough'd half his side, and bared it to the bone.
By Pallas' care, the spear, though deep infix'd,
Stopp'd short of life, nor with his entrails mix'd.

The wound not mortal wise Ulysses knew,
Then furious thus (but first some steps withdrew):
"Unhappy man! whose death our hands shall grace,
Fate calls thee hence and finish'd is thy race.
Nor longer check my conquests on the foe;
But, pierced by this, to endless darkness go,
And add one spectre to the realms below!"

He spoke, while Socus, seized with sudden fright,
Trembling gave way, and turn'd his back to flight;
Between his shoulders pierced the following dart,
And held its passage through the panting heart:
Wide in his breast appear'd the grisly wound;
He falls; his armour rings against the ground.
Then thus Ulysses, gazing on the slain:
"Famed son of Hippasus! there press the plain;
There ends thy narrow span assign'd by fate,
Heaven owes Ulysses yet a longer date.
Ah, wretch! no father shall thy corpse compose;
Thy dying eyes no tender mother close;
But hungry birds shall tear those balls away,
And hovering vultures scream around their prey.
Me Greece shall honour, when I meet my doom,
With solemn funerals and a lasting tomb."

Then raging with intolerable smart,
He writhes his body, and extracts the dart.
The dart a tide of spouting gore pursued,
And gladden'd Troy with sight of hostile blood.
Now troops on troops the fainting chief invade,
Forced he recedes, and loudly calls for aid.
Thrice to its pitch his lofty voice he rears;
The well-known voice thrice Menelaus hears:
Alarm'd, to Ajax Telamon he cried,
Who shares his labours, and defends his side:
"O friend! Ulysses' shouts invade my ear;
Distressed he seems, and no assistance near;
Strong as he is, yet one opposed to all,
Oppress'd by multitudes, the best may fall.
Greece robb'd of him must bid her host despair,
And feel a loss not ages can repair."

Then, where the cry directs, his course he bends;
Great Ajax, like the god of war, attends,
The prudent chief in sore distress they found,
With bands of furious Trojans compass'd round.(223)
As when some huntsman, with a flying spear,
From the blind thicket wounds a stately deer;
Down his cleft side, while fresh the blood distils,
He bounds aloft, and scuds from hills to hills,
Till life's warm vapour issuing through the wound,
Wild mountain-wolves the fainting beast surround:
Just as their jaws his prostrate limbs invade,
The lion rushes through the woodland shade,
The wolves, though hungry, scour dispersed away;
The lordly savage vindicates his prey.
Ulysses thus, unconquer'd by his pains,
A single warrior half a host sustains:
But soon as Ajax leaves his tower-like shield,
The scattered crowds fly frighted o'er the field;
Atrides' arm the sinking hero stays,
And, saved from numbers, to his car conveys.

Victorious Ajax plies the routed crew;
And first Doryclus, Priam's son, he slew,
On strong Pandocus next inflicts a wound,
And lays Lysander bleeding on the ground.
As when a torrent, swell'd with wintry rains,
Pours from the mountains o'er the deluged plains,
And pines and oaks, from their foundations torn,
A country's ruins! to the seas are borne:
Fierce Ajax thus o'erwhelms the yielding throng;
Men, steeds, and chariots, roll in heaps along.

But Hector, from this scene of slaughter far,
Raged on the left, and ruled the tide of war:
Loud groans proclaim his progress through the plain,
And deep Scamander swells with heaps of slain.
There Nestor and Idomeneus oppose
The warrior's fury; there the battle glows;
There fierce on foot, or from the chariot's height,
His sword deforms the beauteous ranks of fight.
The spouse of Helen, dealing darts around,
Had pierced Machaon with a distant wound:
In his right shoulder the broad shaft appear'd,
And trembling Greece for her physician fear'd.
To Nestor then Idomeneus begun:
"Glory of Greece, old Neleus' valiant son!
Ascend thy chariot, haste with speed away,
And great Machaon to the ships convey;
A wise physician skill'd our wounds to heal,
Is more than armies to the public weal."
Old Nestor mounts the seat; beside him rode
The wounded offspring of the healing god.
He lends the lash; the steeds with sounding feet
Shake the dry field, and thunder toward the fleet.

But now Cebriones, from Hector's car,
Survey'd the various fortune of the war:
"While here (he cried) the flying Greeks are slain,
Trojans on Trojans yonder load the plain.
Before great Ajax see the mingled throng
Of men and chariots driven in heaps along!
I know him well, distinguish'd o'er the field
By the broad glittering of the sevenfold shield.
Thither, O Hector, thither urge thy steeds,
There danger calls, and there the combat bleeds;
There horse and foot in mingled deaths unite,
And groans of slaughter mix with shouts of fight."

Thus having spoke, the driver's lash resounds;
Swift through the ranks the rapid chariot bounds;
Stung by the stroke, the coursers scour the fields,
O'er heaps of carcases, and hills of shields.
The horses' hoofs are bathed in heroes' gore,
And, dashing, purple all the car before;
The groaning axle sable drops distils,
And mangled carnage clogs the rapid wheels.
Here Hector, plunging through the thickest fight,
Broke the dark phalanx, and let in the light:
(By the long lance, the sword, or ponderous stone.
The ranks he scatter'd and the troops o'erthrown:)
Ajax he shuns, through all the dire debate,
And fears that arm whose force he felt so late.
But partial Jove, espousing Hector's part,
Shot heaven-bred horror through the Grecian's heart;
Confused, unnerved in Hector's presence grown,
Amazed he stood, with terrors not his own.
O'er his broad back his moony shield he threw,
And, glaring round, by tardy steps withdrew.
Thus the grim lion his retreat maintains,
Beset with watchful dogs, and shouting swains;
Repulsed by numbers from the nightly stalls,
Though rage impels him, and though hunger calls,
Long stands the showering darts, and missile fires;
Then sourly slow the indignant beast retires:
So turn'd stern Ajax, by whole hosts repell'd,
While his swoln heart at every step rebell'd.

As the slow beast, with heavy strength endued,
In some wide field by troops of boys pursued,
Though round his sides a wooden tempest rain,
Crops the tall harvest, and lays waste the plain;
Thick on his hide the hollow blows resound,
The patient animal maintains his ground,
Scarce from the field with all their efforts chased,
And stirs but slowly when he stirs at last:
On Ajax thus a weight of Trojans hung,
The strokes redoubled on his buckler rung;
Confiding now in bulky strength he stands,
Now turns, and backward bears the yielding bands;
Now stiff recedes, yet hardly seems to fly,
And threats his followers with retorted eye.
Fix'd as the bar between two warring powers,
While hissing darts descend in iron showers:
In his broad buckler many a weapon stood,
Its surface bristled with a quivering wood;
And many a javelin, guiltless on the plain,
Marks the dry dust, and thirsts for blood in vain.
But bold Eurypylus his aid imparts,
And dauntless springs beneath a cloud of darts;
Whose eager javelin launch'd against the foe,
Great Apisaon felt the fatal blow;
From his torn liver the red current flow'd,
And his slack knees desert their dying load.
The victor rushing to despoil the dead,
From Paris' bow a vengeful arrow fled;
Fix'd in his nervous thigh the weapon stood,
Fix'd was the point, but broken was the wood.
Back to the lines the wounded Greek retired,
Yet thus retreating, his associates fired:

"What god, O Grecians! has your hearts dismay'd?
Oh, turn to arms; 'tis Ajax claims your aid.
This hour he stands the mark of hostile rage,
And this the last brave battle he shall wage:
Haste, join your forces; from the gloomy grave
The warrior rescue, and your country save."
Thus urged the chief: a generous troop appears,
Who spread their bucklers, and advance their spears,
To guard their wounded friend: while thus they stand
With pious care, great Ajax joins the band:
Each takes new courage at the hero's sight;
The hero rallies, and renews the fight.

Thus raged both armies like conflicting fires,
While Nestor's chariot far from fight retires:
His coursers steep'd in sweat, and stain'd with gore,
The Greeks' preserver, great Machaon, bore.
That hour Achilles, from the topmost height
Of his proud fleet, o'erlook'd the fields of fight;
His feasted eyes beheld around the plain
The Grecian rout, the slaying, and the slain.
His friend Machaon singled from the rest,
A transient pity touch'd his vengeful breast.
Straight to Menoetius' much-loved son he sent:
Graceful as Mars, Patroclus quits his tent;
In evil hour! Then fate decreed his doom,
And fix'd the date of all his woes to come.

"Why calls my friend? thy loved injunctions lay;
Whate'er thy will, Patroclus shall obey."

"O first of friends! (Pelides thus replied)
Still at my heart, and ever at my side!
The time is come, when yon despairing host
Shall learn the value of the man they lost:
Now at my knees the Greeks shall pour their moan,
And proud Atrides tremble on his throne.
Go now to Nestor, and from him be taught
What wounded warrior late his chariot brought:
For, seen at distance, and but seen behind,
His form recall'd Machaon to my mind;
Nor could I, through yon cloud, discern his face,
The coursers pass'd me with so swift a pace."

The hero said. His friend obey'd with haste,
Through intermingled ships and tents he pass'd;
The chiefs descending from their car he found:
The panting steeds Eurymedon unbound.
The warriors standing on the breezy shore,
To dry their sweat, and wash away the gore,
Here paused a moment, while the gentle gale
Convey'd that freshness the cool seas exhale;
Then to consult on farther methods went,
And took their seats beneath the shady tent.
The draught prescribed, fair Hecamede prepares,
Arsinous' daughter, graced with golden hairs:
(Whom to his aged arms, a royal slave,
Greece, as the prize of Nestor's wisdom gave:)
A table first with azure feet she placed;
Whose ample orb a brazen charger graced;
Honey new-press'd, the sacred flour of wheat,
And wholesome garlic, crown'd the savoury treat,
Next her white hand an antique goblet brings,
A goblet sacred to the Pylian kings
From eldest times: emboss'd with studs of gold,
Two feet support it, and four handles hold;
On each bright handle, bending o'er the brink,
In sculptured gold, two turtles seem to drink:
A massy weight, yet heaved with ease by him,
When the brisk nectar overlook'd the brim.
Temper'd in this, the nymph of form divine
Pours a large portion of the Pramnian wine;
With goat's-milk cheese a flavourous taste bestows,
And last with flour the smiling surface strows:
This for the wounded prince the dame prepares:
The cordial beverage reverend Nestor shares:
Salubrious draughts the warriors' thirst allay,
And pleasing conference beguiles the day.

Meantime Patroclus, by Achilles sent,
Unheard approached, and stood before the tent.
Old Nestor, rising then, the hero led
To his high seat: the chief refused and said:

"'Tis now no season for these kind delays;
The great Achilles with impatience stays.
To great Achilles this respect I owe;
Who asks, what hero, wounded by the foe,
Was borne from combat by thy foaming steeds?
With grief I see the great Machaon bleeds.
This to report, my hasty course I bend;
Thou know'st the fiery temper of my friend."
"Can then the sons of Greece (the sage rejoin'd)
Excite compassion in Achilles' mind?
Seeks he the sorrows of our host to know?
This is not half the story of our woe.
Tell him, not great Machaon bleeds alone,
Our bravest heroes in the navy groan,
Ulysses, Agamemnon, Diomed,
And stern Eurypylus, already bleed.
But, ah! what flattering hopes I entertain!
Achilles heeds not, but derides our pain:
Even till the flames consume our fleet he stays,
And waits the rising of the fatal blaze.
Chief after chief the raging foe destroys;
Calm he looks on, and every death enjoys.
Now the slow course of all-impairing time
Unstrings my nerves, and ends my manly prime;
Oh! had I still that strength my youth possess'd,
When this bold arm the Epeian powers oppress'd,
The bulls of Elis in glad triumph led,
And stretch'd the great Itymonaeus dead!
Then from my fury fled the trembling swains,
And ours was all the plunder of the plains:
Fifty white flocks, full fifty herds of swine,
As many goats, as many lowing kine:
And thrice the number of unrivall'd steeds,
All teeming females, and of generous breeds.
These, as my first essay of arms, I won;
Old Neleus gloried in his conquering son.
Thus Elis forced, her long arrears restored,
And shares were parted to each Pylian lord.
The state of Pyle was sunk to last despair,
When the proud Elians first commenced the war:
For Neleus' sons Alcides' rage had slain;
Of twelve bold brothers, I alone remain!
Oppress'd, we arm'd; and now this conquest gain'd,
My sire three hundred chosen sheep obtain'd.
(That large reprisal he might justly claim,
For prize defrauded, and insulted fame,
When Elis' monarch, at the public course,
Detain'd his chariot, and victorious horse.)
The rest the people shared; myself survey'd
The just partition, and due victims paid.
Three days were past, when Elis rose to war,
With many a courser, and with many a car;
The sons of Actor at their army's head
(Young as they were) the vengeful squadrons led.
High on the rock fair Thryoessa stands,
Our utmost frontier on the Pylian lands:
Not far the streams of famed Alphaeus flow:
The stream they pass'd, and pitch'd their tents below.
Pallas, descending in the shades of night,
Alarms the Pylians and commands the fight.
Each burns for fame, and swells with martial pride,
Myself the foremost; but my sire denied;
Fear'd for my youth, exposed to stern alarms;
And stopp'd my chariot, and detain'd my arms.
My sire denied in vain: on foot I fled
Amidst our chariots; for the goddess led.

"Along fair Arene's delightful plain
Soft Minyas rolls his waters to the main:
There, horse and foot, the Pylian troops unite,
And sheathed in arms, expect the dawning light.
Thence, ere the sun advanced his noon-day flame,
To great Alphaeus' sacred source we came.
There first to Jove our solemn rites were paid;
An untamed heifer pleased the blue-eyed maid;
A bull, Alphaeus; and a bull was slain
To the blue monarch of the watery main.
In arms we slept, beside the winding flood,
While round the town the fierce Epeians stood.
Soon as the sun, with all-revealing ray,
Flamed in the front of Heaven, and gave the day.
Bright scenes of arms, and works of war appear;
The nations meet; there Pylos, Elis here.
The first who fell, beneath my javelin bled;
King Augias' son, and spouse of Agamede:
(She that all simples' healing virtues knew,
And every herb that drinks the morning dew:)
I seized his car, the van of battle led;
The Epeians saw, they trembled, and they fled.
The foe dispersed, their bravest warrior kill'd,
Fierce as the whirlwind now I swept the field:
Full fifty captive chariots graced my train;
Two chiefs from each fell breathless to the plain.
Then Actor's sons had died, but Neptune shrouds
The youthful heroes in a veil of clouds.
O'er heapy shields, and o'er the prostrate throng,
Collecting spoils, and slaughtering all along,
Through wide Buprasian fields we forced the foes,
Where o'er the vales the Olenian rocks arose;
Till Pallas stopp'd us where Alisium flows.
Even there the hindmost of the rear I slay,
And the same arm that led concludes the day;
Then back to Pyle triumphant take my way.
There to high Jove were public thanks assign'd,
As first of gods; to Nestor, of mankind.
Such then I was, impell'd by youthful blood;
So proved my valour for my country's good.

"Achilles with unactive fury glows,
And gives to passion what to Greece he owes.
How shall he grieve, when to the eternal shade
Her hosts shall sink, nor his the power to aid!
0 friend! my memory recalls the day,
When, gathering aids along the Grecian sea,
I, and Ulysses, touch'd at Phthia's port,
And entered Peleus' hospitable court.
A bull to Jove he slew in sacrifice,
And pour'd libations on the flaming thighs.
Thyself, Achilles, and thy reverend sire
Menoetius, turn'd the fragments on the fire.
Achilles sees us, to the feast invites;
Social we sit, and share the genial rites.
We then explained the cause on which we came,
Urged you to arms, and found you fierce for fame.
Your ancient fathers generous precepts gave;
Peleus said only this:--'My son! be brave.'
Menoetius thus: 'Though great Achilles shine
In strength superior, and of race divine,
Yet cooler thoughts thy elder years attend;
Let thy just counsels aid, and rule thy friend.'
Thus spoke your father at Thessalia's court:
Words now forgot, though now of vast import.
Ah! try the utmost that a friend can say:
Such gentle force the fiercest minds obey;
Some favouring god Achilles' heart may move;
Though deaf to glory, he may yield to love.
If some dire oracle his breast alarm,
If aught from Heaven withhold his saving arm,
Some beam of comfort yet on Greece may shine,
If thou but lead the Myrmidonian line;
Clad in Achilles' arms, if thou appear,
Proud Troy may tremble, and desist from war;
Press'd by fresh forces, her o'er-labour'd train
Shall seek their walls, and Greece respire again."

This touch'd his generous heart, and from the tent
Along the shore with hasty strides he went;
Soon as he came, where, on the crowded strand,
The public mart and courts of justice stand,
Where the tall fleet of great Ulysses lies,
And altars to the guardian gods arise;
There, sad, he met the brave Euaemon's son,
Large painful drops from all his members run;
An arrow's head yet rooted in his wound,
The sable blood in circles mark'd the ground.
As faintly reeling he confess'd the smart,
Weak was his pace, but dauntless was his heart.
Divine compassion touch'd Patroclus' breast,
Who, sighing, thus his bleeding friend address'd:

"Ah, hapless leaders of the Grecian host!
Thus must ye perish on a barbarous coast?
Is this your fate, to glut the dogs with gore,
Far from your friends, and from your native shore?
Say, great Eurypylus! shall Greece yet stand?
Resists she yet the raging Hector's hand?
Or are her heroes doom'd to die with shame,
And this the period of our wars and fame?"

Eurypylus replies: "No more, my friend;
Greece is no more! this day her glories end;
Even to the ships victorious Troy pursues,
Her force increasing as her toil renews.
Those chiefs, that used her utmost rage to meet,
Lie pierced with wounds, and bleeding in the fleet.
But, thou, Patroclus! act a friendly part,
Lead to my ships, and draw this deadly dart;
With lukewarm water wash the gore away;
With healing balms the raging smart allay,
Such as sage Chiron, sire of pharmacy,
Once taught Achilles, and Achilles thee.
Of two famed surgeons, Podalirius stands
This hour surrounded by the Trojan bands;
And great Machaon, wounded in his tent,
Now wants that succour which so oft he lent."

To him the chief: "What then remains to do?
The event of things the gods alone can view.
Charged by Achilles' great command I fly,
And bear with haste the Pylian king's reply:
But thy distress this instant claims relief."
He said, and in his arms upheld the chief.
The slaves their master's slow approach survey'd,
And hides of oxen on the floor display'd:
There stretch'd at length the wounded hero lay;
Patroclus cut the forky steel away:
Then in his hands a bitter root he bruised;
The wound he wash'd, the styptic juice infused.
The closing flesh that instant ceased to glow,
The wound to torture, and the blood to flow.

BOOK XII.


ARGUMENT.

THE BATTLE AT THE GRECIAN WALL.

The Greeks having retired into their intrenchments, Hector attempts to
force them; but it proving impossible to pass the ditch, Polydamas advises
to quit their chariots, and manage the attack on foot. The Trojans follow
his counsel; and having divided their army into five bodies of foot, begin
the assault. But upon the signal of an eagle with a serpent in his talons,
which appeared on the left hand of the Trojans, Polydamas endeavours to
withdraw them again. This Hector opposes, and continues the attack; in
which, after many actions, Sarpedon makes the first breach in the wall.
Hector also, casting a stone of vast size, forces open one of the gates,
and enters at the head of his troops, who victoriously pursue the Grecians
even to their ships.

While thus the hero's pious cares attend
The cure and safety of his wounded friend,
Trojans and Greeks with clashing shields engage,
And mutual deaths are dealt with mutual rage.
Nor long the trench or lofty walls oppose;
With gods averse the ill-fated works arose;
Their powers neglected, and no victim slain,
The walls were raised, the trenches sunk in vain.

Without the gods, how short a period stands
The proudest monument of mortal hands!
This stood while Hector and Achilles raged.
While sacred Troy the warring hosts engaged;
But when her sons were slain, her city burn'd,
And what survived of Greece to Greece return'd;
Then Neptune and Apollo shook the shore,
Then Ida's summits pour'd their watery store;
Rhesus and Rhodius then unite their rills,
Caresus roaring down the stony hills,
Ćsepus, Granicus, with mingled force,
And Xanthus foaming from his fruitful source;
And gulfy Simois, rolling to the main(224)
Helmets, and shields, and godlike heroes slain:
These, turn'd by Phoebus from their wonted ways,
Deluged the rampire nine continual days;
The weight of waters saps the yielding wall,
And to the sea the floating bulwarks fall.
Incessant cataracts the Thunderer pours,
And half the skies descend in sluicy showers.
The god of ocean, marching stern before,
With his huge trident wounds the trembling shore,
Vast stones and piles from their foundation heaves,
And whelms the smoky ruin in the waves.
Now smooth'd with sand, and levell'd by the flood,
No fragment tells where once the wonder stood;
In their old bounds the rivers roll again,
Shine 'twixt the hills, or wander o'er the plain.(225)

But this the gods in later times perform;
As yet the bulwark stood, and braved the storm;
The strokes yet echoed of contending powers;
War thunder'd at the gates, and blood distain'd the towers.
Smote by the arm of Jove with dire dismay,
Close by their hollow ships the Grecians lay:
Hector's approach in every wind they hear,
And Hector's fury every moment fear.
He, like a whirlwind, toss'd the scattering throng,
Mingled the troops, and drove the field along.
So 'midst the dogs and hunters' daring bands,
Fierce of his might, a boar or lion stands;
Arm'd foes around a dreadful circle form,
And hissing javelins rain an iron storm:
His powers untamed, their bold assault defy,
And where he turns the rout disperse or die:
He foams, he glares, he bounds against them all,
And if he falls, his courage makes him fall.
With equal rage encompass'd Hector glows;
Exhorts his armies, and the trenches shows.
The panting steeds impatient fury breathe,
And snort and tremble at the gulf beneath;
Just at the brink they neigh, and paw the ground,
And the turf trembles, and the skies resound.
Eager they view'd the prospect dark and deep,
Vast was the leap, and headlong hung the steep;
The bottom bare, (a formidable show!)
And bristled thick with sharpen'd stakes below.
The foot alone this strong defence could force,
And try the pass impervious to the horse.
This saw Polydamas; who, wisely brave,
Restrain'd great Hector, and this counsel gave:

"O thou, bold leader of the Trojan bands!
And you, confederate chiefs from foreign lands!
What entrance here can cumbrous chariots find,
The stakes beneath, the Grecian walls behind?
No pass through those, without a thousand wounds,
No space for combat in yon narrow bounds.
Proud of the favours mighty Jove has shown,
On certain dangers we too rashly run:
If 'tis will our haughty foes to tame,
Oh may this instant end the Grecian name!
Here, far from Argos, let their heroes fall,
And one great day destroy and bury all!
But should they turn, and here oppress our train,
What hopes, what methods of retreat remain?
Wedged in the trench, by our own troops confused,
In one promiscuous carnage crush'd and bruised,
All Troy must perish, if their arms prevail,
Nor shall a Trojan live to tell the tale.
Hear then, ye warriors! and obey with speed;
Back from the trenches let your steeds be led;
Then all alighting, wedged in firm array,
Proceed on foot, and Hector lead the way.
So Greece shall stoop before our conquering power,
And this (if Jove consent) her fatal hour."

              [Illustration: POLYDAMAS ADVISING HECTOR.]

                      POLYDAMAS ADVISING HECTOR.


This counsel pleased: the godlike Hector sprung
Swift from his seat; his clanging armour rung.
The chief's example follow'd by his train,
Each quits his car, and issues on the plain,
By orders strict the charioteers enjoin'd
Compel the coursers to their ranks behind.
The forces part in five distinguish'd bands,
And all obey their several chiefs' commands.
The best and bravest in the first conspire,
Pant for the fight, and threat the fleet with fire:
Great Hector glorious in the van of these,
Polydamas, and brave Cebriones.
Before the next the graceful Paris shines,
And bold Alcathous, and Agenor joins.
The sons of Priam with the third appear,
Deiphobus, and Helenas the seer;
In arms with these the mighty Asius stood,
Who drew from Hyrtacus his noble blood,
And whom Arisba's yellow coursers bore,
The coursers fed on Selle's winding shore.
Antenor's sons the fourth battalion guide,
And great Ćneas, born on fountful Ide.
Divine Sarpedon the last band obey'd,
Whom Glaucus and Asteropaeus aid.
Next him, the bravest, at their army's head,
But he more brave than all the hosts he led.

Now with compacted shields in close array,
The moving legions speed their headlong way:
Already in their hopes they fire the fleet,
And see the Grecians gasping at their feet.

While every Trojan thus, and every aid,
The advice of wise Polydamas obey'd,
Asius alone, confiding in his car,
His vaunted coursers urged to meet the war.
Unhappy hero! and advised in vain;
Those wheels returning ne'er shall mark the plain;
No more those coursers with triumphant joy
Restore their master to the gates of Troy!
Black death attends behind the Grecian wall,
And great Idomeneus shall boast thy fall!
Fierce to the left he drives, where from the plain
The flying Grecians strove their ships to gain;
Swift through the wall their horse and chariots pass'd,
The gates half-open'd to receive the last.
Thither, exulting in his force, he flies:
His following host with clamours rend the skies:
To plunge the Grecians headlong in the main,
Such their proud hopes; but all their hopes were vain!

To guard the gates, two mighty chiefs attend,
Who from the Lapiths' warlike race descend;
This Polypoetes, great Perithous' heir,
And that Leonteus, like the god of war.
As two tall oaks, before the wall they rise;
Their roots in earth, their heads amidst the skies:
Whose spreading arms with leafy honours crown'd,
Forbid the tempest, and protect the ground;
High on the hills appears their stately form,
And their deep roots for ever brave the storm.
So graceful these, and so the shock they stand
Of raging Asius, and his furious band.
Orestes, Acamas, in front appear,
And OEnomaus and Thoon close the rear:
In vain their clamours shake the ambient fields,
In vain around them beat their hollow shields;
The fearless brothers on the Grecians call,
To guard their navies, and defend the wall.
Even when they saw Troy's sable troops impend,
And Greece tumultuous from her towers descend,
Forth from the portals rush'd the intrepid pair,
Opposed their breasts, and stood themselves the war.
So two wild boars spring furious from their den,
Roused with the cries of dogs and voice of men;
On every side the crackling trees they tear,
And root the shrubs, and lay the forest bare;
They gnash their tusks, with fire their eye-balls roll,
Till some wide wound lets out their mighty soul.
Around their heads the whistling javelins sung,
With sounding strokes their brazen targets rung;
Fierce was the fight, while yet the Grecian powers
Maintain'd the walls, and mann'd the lofty towers:
To save their fleet their last efforts they try,
And stones and darts in mingled tempests fly.

As when sharp Boreas blows abroad, and brings
The dreary winter on his frozen wings;
Beneath the low-hung clouds the sheets of snow
Descend, and whiten all the fields below:
So fast the darts on either army pour,
So down the rampires rolls the rocky shower:
Heavy, and thick, resound the batter'd shields,
And the deaf echo rattles round the fields.

With shame repulsed, with grief and fury driven,
The frantic Asius thus accuses Heaven:
"In powers immortal who shall now believe?
Can those too flatter, and can Jove deceive?
What man could doubt but Troy's victorious power
Should humble Greece, and this her fatal hour?
But like when wasps from hollow crannies drive,
To guard the entrance of their common hive,
Darkening the rock, while with unwearied wings
They strike the assailants, and infix their stings;
A race determined, that to death contend:
So fierce these Greeks their last retreats defend.
Gods! shall two warriors only guard their gates,
Repel an army, and defraud the fates?"

These empty accents mingled with the wind,
Nor moved great Jove's unalterable mind;
To godlike Hector and his matchless might
Was owed the glory of the destined fight.
Like deeds of arms through all the forts were tried,
And all the gates sustain'd an equal tide;
Through the long walls the stony showers were heard,
The blaze of flames, the flash of arms appear'd.
The spirit of a god my breast inspire,
To raise each act to life, and sing with fire!
While Greece unconquer'd kept alive the war,
Secure of death, confiding in despair;
And all her guardian gods, in deep dismay,
With unassisting arms deplored the day.

Even yet the dauntless Lapithae maintain
The dreadful pass, and round them heap the slain.
First Damasus, by Polypoetes' steel,
Pierced through his helmet's brazen visor, fell;
The weapon drank the mingled brains and gore!
The warrior sinks, tremendous now no more!
Next Ormenus and Pylon yield their breath:
Nor less Leonteus strews the field with death;
First through the belt Hippomachus he gored,
Then sudden waved his unresisted sword:
Antiphates, as through the ranks he broke,
The falchion struck, and fate pursued the stroke:
Iamenus, Orestes, Menon, bled;
And round him rose a monument of dead.
Meantime, the bravest of the Trojan crew,
Bold Hector and Polydamas, pursue;
Fierce with impatience on the works to fall,
And wrap in rolling flames the fleet and wall.
These on the farther bank now stood and gazed,
By Heaven alarm'd, by prodigies amazed:
A signal omen stopp'd the passing host,
Their martial fury in their wonder lost.
Jove's bird on sounding pinions beat the skies;
A bleeding serpent of enormous size,
His talons truss'd; alive, and curling round,
He stung the bird, whose throat received the wound:
Mad with the smart, he drops the fatal prey,
In airy circles wings his painful way,
Floats on the winds, and rends the heaven with cries:
Amidst the host the fallen serpent lies.
They, pale with terror, mark its spires unroll'd,
And Jove's portent with beating hearts behold.
Then first Polydamas the silence broke,
Long weigh'd the signal, and to Hector spoke:

"How oft, my brother, thy reproach I bear,
For words well meant, and sentiments sincere?
True to those counsels which I judge the best,
I tell the faithful dictates of my breast.
To speak his thoughts is every freeman's right,
In peace, in war, in council, and in fight;
And all I move, deferring to thy sway,
But tends to raise that power which I obey.
Then hear my words, nor may my words be vain!
Seek not this day the Grecian ships to gain;
For sure, to warn us, Jove his omen sent,
And thus my mind explains its clear event:
The victor eagle, whose sinister flight
Retards our host, and fills our hearts with fright,
Dismiss'd his conquest in the middle skies,
Allow'd to seize, but not possess the prize;
Thus, though we gird with fires the Grecian fleet,
Though these proud bulwalks tumble at our feet,
Toils unforeseen, and fiercer, are decreed;
More woes shall follow, and more heroes bleed.
So bodes my soul, and bids me thus advise;
For thus a skilful seer would read the skies."

To him then Hector with disdain return'd:
(Fierce as he spoke, his eyes with fury burn'd:)
"Are these the faithful counsels of thy tongue?
Thy will is partial, not thy reason wrong:
Or if the purpose of thy heart thou vent,
Sure heaven resumes the little sense it lent.
What coward counsels would thy madness move
Against the word, the will reveal'd of Jove?
The leading sign, the irrevocable nod,
And happy thunders of the favouring god,
These shall I slight, and guide my wavering mind
By wandering birds that flit with every wind?
Ye vagrants of the sky! your wings extend,
Or where the suns arise, or where descend;
To right, to left, unheeded take your way,
While I the dictates of high heaven obey.
Without a sign his sword the brave man draws,
And asks no omen but his country's cause.
But why should'st thou suspect the war's success?
None fears it more, as none promotes it less:
Though all our chiefs amidst yon ships expire,
Trust thy own cowardice to escape their fire.
Troy and her sons may find a general grave,
But thou canst live, for thou canst be a slave.
Yet should the fears that wary mind suggests
Spread their cold poison through our soldiers' breasts,
My javelin can revenge so base a part,
And free the soul that quivers in thy heart."

Furious he spoke, and, rushing to the wall,
Calls on his host; his host obey the call;
With ardour follow where their leader flies:
Redoubling clamours thunder in the skies.
Jove breathes a whirlwind from the hills of Ide,
And drifts of dust the clouded navy hide;
He fills the Greeks with terror and dismay,
And gives great Hector the predestined day.
Strong in themselves, but stronger in his aid,
Close to the works their rigid siege they laid.
In vain the mounds and massy beams defend,
While these they undermine, and those they rend;
Upheaved the piles that prop the solid wall;
And heaps on heaps the smoky ruins fall.
Greece on her ramparts stands the fierce alarms;
The crowded bulwarks blaze with waving arms,
Shield touching shield, a long refulgent row;
Whence hissing darts, incessant, rain below.
The bold Ajaces fly from tower to tower,
And rouse, with flame divine, the Grecian power.
The generous impulse every Greek obeys;
Threats urge the fearful; and the valiant, praise.

"Fellows in arms! whose deeds are known to fame,
And you, whose ardour hopes an equal name!
Since not alike endued with force or art;
Behold a day when each may act his part!
A day to fire the brave, and warm the cold,
To gain new glories, or augment the old.
Urge those who stand, and those who faint, excite;
Drown Hector's vaunts in loud exhorts of fight;
Conquest, not safety, fill the thoughts of all;
Seek not your fleet, but sally from the wall;
So Jove once more may drive their routed train,
And Troy lie trembling in her walls again."

Their ardour kindles all the Grecian powers;
And now the stones descend in heavier showers.
As when high Jove his sharp artillery forms,
And opes his cloudy magazine of storms;
In winter's bleak un comfortable reign,
A snowy inundation hides the plain;
He stills the winds, and bids the skies to sleep;
Then pours the silent tempest thick and deep;
And first the mountain-tops are cover'd o'er,
Then the green fields, and then the sandy shore;
Bent with the weight, the nodding woods are seen,
And one bright waste hides all the works of men:
The circling seas, alone absorbing all,
Drink the dissolving fleeces as they fall:
So from each side increased the stony rain,
And the white ruin rises o'er the plain.

Thus godlike Hector and his troops contend
To force the ramparts, and the gates to rend:
Nor Troy could conquer, nor the Greeks would yield,
Till great Sarpedon tower'd amid the field;
For mighty Jove inspired with martial flame
His matchless son, and urged him on to fame.
In arms he shines, conspicuous from afar,
And bears aloft his ample shield in air;
Within whose orb the thick bull-hides were roll'd,
Ponderous with brass, and bound with ductile gold:
And while two pointed javelins arm his hands,
Majestic moves along, and leads his Lycian bands.

So press'd with hunger, from the mountain's brow
Descends a lion on the flocks below;
So stalks the lordly savage o'er the plain,
In sullen majesty, and stern disdain:
In vain loud mastiffs bay him from afar,
And shepherds gall him with an iron war;
Regardless, furious, he pursues his way;
He foams, he roars, he rends the panting prey.

Resolved alike, divine Sarpedon glows
With generous rage that drives him on the foes.
He views the towers, and meditates their fall,
To sure destruction dooms the aspiring wall;
Then casting on his friend an ardent look,
Fired with the thirst of glory, thus he spoke:

"Why boast we, Glaucus! our extended reign,(226)
Where Xanthus' streams enrich the Lycian plain,
Our numerous herds that range the fruitful field,
And hills where vines their purple harvest yield,
Our foaming bowls with purer nectar crown'd,
Our feasts enhanced with music's sprightly sound?
Why on those shores are we with joy survey'd,
Admired as heroes, and as gods obey'd,
Unless great acts superior merit prove,
And vindicate the bounteous powers above?
'Tis ours, the dignity they give to grace;
The first in valour, as the first in place;
That when with wondering eyes our martial bands
Behold our deeds transcending our commands,
Such, they may cry, deserve the sovereign state,
Whom those that envy dare not imitate!
Could all our care elude the gloomy grave,
Which claims no less the fearful and the brave,
For lust of fame I should not vainly dare
In fighting fields, nor urge thy soul to war.
But since, alas! ignoble age must come,
Disease, and death's inexorable doom
The life, which others pay, let us bestow,
And give to fame what we to nature owe;
Brave though we fall, and honour'd if we live,
Or let us glory gain, or glory give!"

He said; his words the listening chief inspire
With equal warmth, and rouse the warrior's fire;
The troops pursue their leaders with delight,
Rush to the foe, and claim the promised fight.
Menestheus from on high the storm beheld
Threatening the fort, and blackening in the field:
Around the walls he gazed, to view from far
What aid appear'd to avert the approaching war,
And saw where Teucer with the Ajaces stood,
Of fight insatiate, prodigal of blood.
In vain he calls; the din of helms and shields
Rings to the skies, and echoes through the fields,
The brazen hinges fly, the walls resound,
Heaven trembles, roar the mountains, thunders all the ground
Then thus to Thoos: "Hence with speed (he said),
And urge the bold Ajaces to our aid;
Their strength, united, best may help to bear
The bloody labours of the doubtful war:
Hither the Lycian princes bend their course,
The best and bravest of the hostile force.
But if too fiercely there the foes contend,
Let Telamon, at least, our towers defend,
And Teucer haste with his unerring bow
To share the danger, and repel the foe."

Swift, at the word, the herald speeds along
The lofty ramparts, through the martial throng,
And finds the heroes bathed in sweat and gore,
Opposed in combat on the dusty shore.
"Ye valiant leaders of our warlike bands!
Your aid (said Thoos) Peteus' son demands;
Your strength, united, best may help to bear
The bloody labours of the doubtful war:
Thither the Lycian princes bend their course,
The best and bravest of the hostile force.
But if too fiercely, here, the foes contend,
At least, let Telamon those towers defend,
And Teucer haste with his unerring bow
To share the danger, and repel the foe."

Straight to the fort great Ajax turn'd his care,
And thus bespoke his brothers of the war:
"Now, valiant Lycomede! exert your might,
And, brave Oileus, prove your force in fight;
To you I trust the fortune of the field,
Till by this arm the foe shall be repell'd:
That done, expect me to complete the day
Then with his sevenfold shield he strode away.
With equal steps bold Teucer press'd the shore,
Whose fatal bow the strong Pandion bore.

High on the walls appear'd the Lycian powers,
Like some black tempest gathering round the towers:
The Greeks, oppress'd, their utmost force unite,
Prepared to labour in the unequal fight:
The war renews, mix'd shouts and groans arise;
Tumultuous clamour mounts, and thickens in the skies.
Fierce Ajax first the advancing host invades,
And sends the brave Epicles to the shades,
Sarpedon's friend. Across the warrior's way,
Rent from the walls, a rocky fragment lay;
In modern ages not the strongest swain
Could heave the unwieldy burden from the plain:
He poised, and swung it round; then toss'd on high,
It flew with force, and labour'd up the sky;
Full on the Lycian's helmet thundering down,
The ponderous ruin crush'd his batter'd crown.
As skilful divers from some airy steep
Headlong descend, and shoot into the deep,
So falls Epicles; then in groans expires,
And murmuring to the shades the soul retires.

While to the ramparts daring Glaucus drew,
From Teucer's hand a winged arrow flew;
The bearded shaft the destined passage found,
And on his naked arm inflicts a wound.
The chief, who fear'd some foe's insulting boast
Might stop the progress of his warlike host,
Conceal'd the wound, and, leaping from his height
Retired reluctant from the unfinish'd fight.
Divine Sarpedon with regret beheld
Disabled Glaucus slowly quit the field;
His beating breast with generous ardour glows,
He springs to fight, and flies upon the foes.
Alcmaon first was doom'd his force to feel;
Deep in his breast he plunged the pointed steel;
Then from the yawning wound with fury tore
The spear, pursued by gushing streams of gore:
Down sinks the warrior with a thundering sound,
His brazen armour rings against the ground.

Swift to the battlement the victor flies,
Tugs with full force, and every nerve applies:
It shakes; the ponderous stones disjointed yield;
The rolling ruins smoke along the field.
A mighty breach appears; the walls lie bare;
And, like a deluge, rushes in the war.
At once bold Teucer draws the twanging bow,
And Ajax sends his javelin at the foe;
Fix'd in his belt the feather'd weapon stood,
And through his buckler drove the trembling wood;
But Jove was present in the dire debate,
To shield his offspring, and avert his fate.
The prince gave back, not meditating flight,
But urging vengeance, and severer fight;
Then raised with hope, and fired with glory's charms,
His fainting squadrons to new fury warms.
"O where, ye Lycians, is the strength you boast?
Your former fame and ancient virtue lost!
The breach lies open, but your chief in vain
Attempts alone the guarded pass to gain:
Unite, and soon that hostile fleet shall fall:
The force of powerful union conquers all."

This just rebuke inflamed the Lycian crew;
They join, they thicken, and the assault renew:
Unmoved the embodied Greeks their fury dare,
And fix'd support the weight of all the war;
Nor could the Greeks repel the Lycian powers,
Nor the bold Lycians force the Grecian towers.
As on the confines of adjoining grounds,
Two stubborn swains with blows dispute their bounds;
They tug, they sweat; but neither gain, nor yield,
One foot, one inch, of the contended field;
Thus obstinate to death, they fight, they fall;
Nor these can keep, nor those can win the wall.
Their manly breasts are pierced with many a wound,
Loud strokes are heard, and rattling arms resound;
The copious slaughter covers all the shore,
And the high ramparts drip with human gore.

As when two scales are charged with doubtful loads,
From side to side the trembling balance nods,
(While some laborious matron, just and poor,
With nice exactness weighs her woolly store,)
Till poised aloft, the resting beam suspends
Each equal weight; nor this, nor that, descends:(227)
So stood the war, till Hector's matchless might,
With fates prevailing, turn'd the scale of fight.
Fierce as a whirlwind up the walls he flies,
And fires his host with loud repeated cries.
"Advance, ye Trojans! lend your valiant hands,
Haste to the fleet, and toss the blazing brands!"
They hear, they run; and, gathering at his call,
Raise scaling engines, and ascend the wall:
Around the works a wood of glittering spears
Shoots up, and all the rising host appears.
A ponderous stone bold Hector heaved to throw,
Pointed above, and rough and gross below:
Not two strong men the enormous weight could raise,
Such men as live in these degenerate days:
Yet this, as easy as a swain could bear
The snowy fleece, he toss'd, and shook in air;
For Jove upheld, and lighten'd of its load
The unwieldy rock, the labour of a god.
Thus arm'd, before the folded gates he came,
Of massy substance, and stupendous frame;
With iron bars and brazen hinges strong,
On lofty beams of solid timber hung:
Then thundering through the planks with forceful sway,
Drives the sharp rock; the solid beams give way,
The folds are shatter'd; from the crackling door
Leap the resounding bars, the flying hinges roar.
Now rushing in, the furious chief appears,
Gloomy as night! and shakes two shining spears:(228)
A dreadful gleam from his bright armour came,
And from his eye-balls flash'd the living flame.
He moves a god, resistless in his course,
And seems a match for more than mortal force.
Then pouring after, through the gaping space,
A tide of Trojans flows, and fills the place;
The Greeks behold, they tremble, and they fly;
The shore is heap'd with death, and tumult rends the sky.

BOOK XIII.


ARGUMENT.

THE FOURTH BATTLE CONTINUED, IN WHICH NEPTUNE ASSISTS THE GREEKS: THE ACTS
OF IDOMENEUS.

Neptune, concerned for the loss of the Grecians, upon seeing the
fortification forced by Hector, (who had entered the gate near the station
of the Ajaces,) assumes the shape of Calchas, and inspires those heroes to
oppose him: then, in the form of one of the generals, encourages the other
Greeks who had retired to their vessels. The Ajaces form their troops in a
close phalanx, and put a stop to Hector and the Trojans. Several deeds of
valour are performed; Meriones, losing his spear in the encounter, repairs
to seek another at the tent of Idomeneus: this occasions a conversation
between those two warriors, who return together to the battle. Idomeneus
signalizes his courage above the rest; he kills Othryoneus, Asius, and
Alcathous: Deiphobus and Ćneas march against him, and at length Idomeneus
retires. Menelaus wounds Helenus, and kills Pisander. The Trojans are
repulsed on the left wing; Hector still keeps his ground against the
Ajaces, till, being galled by the Locrian slingers and archers, Polydamas
advises to call a council of war: Hector approves of his advice, but goes
first to rally the Trojans; upbraids Paris, rejoins Polydamas, meets Ajax
again, and renews the attack.

The eight-and-twentieth day still continues. The scene is between the
Grecian wall and the sea-shore.

When now the Thunderer on the sea-beat coast
Had fix'd great Hector and his conquering host,
He left them to the fates, in bloody fray
To toil and struggle through the well-fought day.
Then turn'd to Thracia from the field of fight
Those eyes that shed insufferable light,
To where the Mysians prove their martial force,
And hardy Thracians tame the savage horse;
And where the far-famed Hippomolgian strays,
Renown'd for justice and for length of days;(229)
Thrice happy race! that, innocent of blood,
From milk, innoxious, seek their simple food:
Jove sees delighted; and avoids the scene
Of guilty Troy, of arms, and dying men:
No aid, he deems, to either host is given,
While his high law suspends the powers of Heaven.

Meantime the monarch of the watery main
Observed the Thunderer, nor observed in vain.
In Samothracia, on a mountain's brow,
Whose waving woods o'erhung the deeps below,
He sat; and round him cast his azure eyes
Where Ida's misty tops confusedly rise;
Below, fair Ilion's glittering spires were seen;
The crowded ships and sable seas between.
There, from the crystal chambers of the main
Emerged, he sat, and mourn'd his Argives slain.
At Jove incensed, with grief and fury stung,
Prone down the rocky steep he rush'd along;
Fierce as he pass'd, the lofty mountains nod,
The forest shakes; earth trembled as he trod,
And felt the footsteps of the immortal god.
From realm to realm three ample strides he took,
And, at the fourth, the distant Ćgae shook.

Far in the bay his shining palace stands,
Eternal frame! not raised by mortal hands:
This having reach'd, his brass-hoof'd steeds he reins,
Fleet as the winds, and deck'd with golden manes.
Refulgent arms his mighty limbs infold,
Immortal arms of adamant and gold.
He mounts the car, the golden scourge applies,
He sits superior, and the chariot flies:
His whirling wheels the glassy surface sweep;
The enormous monsters rolling o'er the deep
Gambol around him on the watery way,
And heavy whales in awkward measures play;
The sea subsiding spreads a level plain,
Exults, and owns the monarch of the main;
The parting waves before his coursers fly;
The wondering waters leave his axle dry.

Deep in the liquid regions lies a cave,
Between where Tenedos the surges lave,
And rocky Imbrus breaks the rolling wave:
There the great ruler of the azure round
Stopp'd his swift chariot, and his steeds unbound,
Fed with ambrosial herbage from his hand,
And link'd their fetlocks with a golden band,
Infrangible, immortal: there they stay:
The father of the floods pursues his way:
Where, like a tempest, darkening heaven around,
Or fiery deluge that devours the ground,
The impatient Trojans, in a gloomy throng,
Embattled roll'd, as Hector rush'd along:
To the loud tumult and the barbarous cry
The heavens re-echo, and the shores reply:
They vow destruction to the Grecian name,
And in their hopes the fleets already flame.

But Neptune, rising from the seas profound,
The god whose earthquakes rock the solid ground,
Now wears a mortal form; like Calchas seen,
Such his loud voice, and such his manly mien;
His shouts incessant every Greek inspire,
But most the Ajaces, adding fire to fire.

             [Illustration: NEPTUNE RISING FROM THE SEA.]

                     NEPTUNE RISING FROM THE SEA.


"'Tis yours, O warriors, all our hopes to raise:
Oh recollect your ancient worth and praise!
'Tis yours to save us, if you cease to fear;
Flight, more than shameful, is destructive here.
On other works though Troy with fury fall,
And pour her armies o'er our batter'd wall:
There Greece has strength: but this, this part o'erthrown,
Her strength were vain; I dread for you alone:
Here Hector rages like the force of fire,
Vaunts of his gods, and calls high Jove his sire:
If yet some heavenly power your breast excite,
Breathe in your hearts, and string your arms to fight,
Greece yet may live, her threaten'd fleet maintain:
And Hector's force, and Jove's own aid, be vain."

Then with his sceptre, that the deep controls,
He touch'd the chiefs, and steel'd their manly souls:
Strength, not their own, the touch divine imparts,
Prompts their light limbs, and swells their daring hearts.
Then, as a falcon from the rocky height,
Her quarry seen, impetuous at the sight,
Forth-springing instant, darts herself from high,
Shoots on the wing, and skims along the sky:
Such, and so swift, the power of ocean flew;
The wide horizon shut him from their view.

The inspiring god Oileus' active son
Perceived the first, and thus to Telamon:

"Some god, my friend, some god in human form
Favouring descends, and wills to stand the storm.
Not Calchas this, the venerable seer;
Short as he turned, I saw the power appear:
I mark'd his parting, and the steps he trod;
His own bright evidence reveals a god.
Even now some energy divine I share,
And seem to walk on wings, and tread in air!"

"With equal ardour (Telamon returns)
My soul is kindled, and my bosom burns;
New rising spirits all my force alarm,
Lift each impatient limb, and brace my arm.
This ready arm, unthinking, shakes the dart;
The blood pours back, and fortifies my heart:
Singly, methinks, yon towering chief I meet,
And stretch the dreadful Hector at my feet."

Full of the god that urged their burning breast,
The heroes thus their mutual warmth express'd.
Neptune meanwhile the routed Greeks inspired;
Who, breathless, pale, with length of labours tired,
Pant in the ships; while Troy to conquest calls,
And swarms victorious o'er their yielding walls:
Trembling before the impending storm they lie,
While tears of rage stand burning in their eye.
Greece sunk they thought, and this their fatal hour;
But breathe new courage as they feel the power.
Teucer and Leitus first his words excite;
Then stern Peneleus rises to the fight;
Thoas, Deipyrus, in arms renown'd,
And Merion next, the impulsive fury found;
Last Nestor's son the same bold ardour takes,
While thus the god the martial fire awakes:

"Oh lasting infamy, oh dire disgrace
To chiefs of vigorous youth, and manly race!
I trusted in the gods, and you, to see
Brave Greece victorious, and her navy free:
Ah, no--the glorious combat you disclaim,
And one black day clouds all her former fame.
Heavens! what a prodigy these eyes survey,
Unseen, unthought, till this amazing day!
Fly we at length from Troy's oft-conquer'd bands?
And falls our fleet by such inglorious hands?
A rout undisciplined, a straggling train,
Not born to glories of the dusty plain;
Like frighted fawns from hill to hill pursued,
A prey to every savage of the wood:
Shall these, so late who trembled at your name,
Invade your camps, involve your ships in flame?
A change so shameful, say, what cause has wrought?
The soldiers' baseness, or the general's fault?
Fools! will ye perish for your leader's vice;
The purchase infamy, and life the price?
'Tis not your cause, Achilles' injured fame:
Another's is the crime, but yours the shame.
Grant that our chief offend through rage or lust,
Must you be cowards, if your king's unjust?
Prevent this evil, and your country save:
Small thought retrieves the spirits of the brave.
Think, and subdue! on dastards dead to fame
I waste no anger, for they feel no shame:
But you, the pride, the flower of all our host,
My heart weeps blood to see your glory lost!
Nor deem this day, this battle, all you lose;
A day more black, a fate more vile, ensues.
Let each reflect, who prizes fame or breath,
On endless infamy, on instant death:
For, lo! the fated time, the appointed shore:
Hark! the gates burst, the brazen barriers roar!
Impetuous Hector thunders at the wall;
The hour, the spot, to conquer, or to fall."

These words the Grecians' fainting hearts inspire,
And listening armies catch the godlike fire.
Fix'd at his post was each bold Ajax found,
With well-ranged squadrons strongly circled round:
So close their order, so disposed their fight,
As Pallas' self might view with fix'd delight;
Or had the god of war inclined his eyes,
The god of war had own'd a just surprise.
A chosen phalanx, firm, resolved as fate,
Descending Hector and his battle wait.
An iron scene gleams dreadful o'er the fields,
Armour in armour lock'd, and shields in shields,
Spears lean on spears, on targets targets throng,
Helms stuck to helms, and man drove man along.
The floating plumes unnumber'd wave above,
As when an earthquake stirs the nodding grove;
And levell'd at the skies with pointing rays,
Their brandish'd lances at each motion blaze.

Thus breathing death, in terrible array,
The close compacted legions urged their way:
Fierce they drove on, impatient to destroy;
Troy charged the first, and Hector first of Troy.
As from some mountain's craggy forehead torn,
A rock's round fragment flies, with fury borne,
(Which from the stubborn stone a torrent rends,)
Precipitate the ponderous mass descends:
From steep to steep the rolling ruin bounds;
At every shock the crackling wood resounds;
Still gathering force, it smokes; and urged amain,
Whirls, leaps, and thunders down, impetuous to the plain:
There stops--so Hector. Their whole force he proved,(230)
Resistless when he raged, and, when he stopp'd, unmoved.

On him the war is bent, the darts are shed,
And all their falchions wave around his head:
Repulsed he stands, nor from his stand retires;
But with repeated shouts his army fires.
"Trojans! be firm; this arm shall make your way
Through yon square body, and that black array:
Stand, and my spear shall rout their scattering power,
Strong as they seem, embattled like a tower;
For he that Juno's heavenly bosom warms,
The first of gods, this day inspires our arms."

He said; and roused the soul in every breast:
Urged with desire of fame, beyond the rest,
Forth march'd Deiphobus; but, marching, held
Before his wary steps his ample shield.
Bold Merion aim'd a stroke (nor aim'd it wide);
The glittering javelin pierced the tough bull-hide;
But pierced not through: unfaithful to his hand,
The point broke short, and sparkled in the sand.
The Trojan warrior, touch'd with timely fear,
On the raised orb to distance bore the spear.
The Greek, retreating, mourn'd his frustrate blow,
And cursed the treacherous lance that spared a foe;
Then to the ships with surly speed he went,
To seek a surer javelin in his tent.

Meanwhile with rising rage the battle glows,
The tumult thickens, and the clamour grows.
By Teucer's arm the warlike Imbrius bleeds,
The son of Mentor, rich in generous steeds.
Ere yet to Troy the sons of Greece were led,
In fair Pedaeus' verdant pastures bred,
The youth had dwelt, remote from war's alarms,
And blest in bright Medesicaste's arms:
(This nymph, the fruit of Priam's ravish'd joy,
Allied the warrior to the house of Troy:)
To Troy, when glory call'd his arms, he came,
And match'd the bravest of her chiefs in fame:
With Priam's sons, a guardian of the throne,
He lived, beloved and honour'd as his own.
Him Teucer pierced between the throat and ear:
He groans beneath the Telamonian spear.
As from some far-seen mountain's airy crown,
Subdued by steel, a tall ash tumbles down,
And soils its verdant tresses on the ground;
So falls the youth; his arms the fall resound.
Then Teucer rushing to despoil the dead,
From Hector's hand a shining javelin fled:
He saw, and shunn'd the death; the forceful dart
Sung on, and pierced Amphimachus's heart,
Cteatus' son, of Neptune's forceful line;
Vain was his courage, and his race divine!
Prostrate he falls; his clanging arms resound,
And his broad buckler thunders on the ground.
To seize his beamy helm the victor flies,
And just had fastened on the dazzling prize,
When Ajax' manly arm a javelin flung;
Full on the shield's round boss the weapon rung;
He felt the shock, nor more was doom'd to feel,
Secure in mail, and sheath'd in shining steel.
Repulsed he yields; the victor Greeks obtain
The spoils contested, and bear off the slain.
Between the leaders of the Athenian line,
(Stichius the brave, Menestheus the divine,)
Deplored Amphimachus, sad object! lies;
Imbrius remains the fierce Ajaces' prize.
As two grim lions bear across the lawn,
Snatch'd from devouring hounds, a slaughter'd fawn.
In their fell jaws high-lifting through the wood,
And sprinkling all the shrubs with drops of blood;
So these, the chief: great Ajax from the dead
Strips his bright arms; Oileus lops his head:
Toss'd like a ball, and whirl'd in air away,
At Hector's feet the gory visage lay.

The god of ocean, fired with stern disdain,
And pierced with sorrow for his grandson slain,
Inspires the Grecian hearts, confirms their hands,
And breathes destruction on the Trojan bands.
Swift as a whirlwind rushing to the fleet,
He finds the lance-famed Idomen of Crete,
His pensive brow the generous care express'd
With which a wounded soldier touch'd his breast,
Whom in the chance of war a javelin tore,
And his sad comrades from the battle bore;
Him to the surgeons of the camp he sent:
That office paid, he issued from his tent
Fierce for the fight: to whom the god begun,
In Thoas' voice, Andraemon's valiant son,
Who ruled where Calydon's white rocks arise,
And Pleuron's chalky cliffs emblaze the skies:

"Where's now the imperious vaunt, the daring boast,
Of Greece victorious, and proud Ilion lost?"

To whom the king: "On Greece no blame be thrown;
Arms are her trade, and war is all her own.
Her hardy heroes from the well-fought plains
Nor fear withholds, nor shameful sloth detains:
'Tis heaven, alas! and Jove's all-powerful doom,
That far, far distant from our native home
Wills us to fall inglorious! Oh, my friend!
Once foremost in the fight, still prone to lend
Or arms or counsels, now perform thy best,
And what thou canst not singly, urge the rest."

Thus he: and thus the god whose force can make
The solid globe's eternal basis shake:
"Ah! never may he see his native land,
But feed the vultures on this hateful strand,
Who seeks ignobly in his ships to stay,
Nor dares to combat on this signal day!
For this, behold! in horrid arms I shine,
And urge thy soul to rival acts with mine.
Together let us battle on the plain;
Two, not the worst; nor even this succour vain:
Not vain the weakest, if their force unite;
But ours, the bravest have confess'd in fight."

This said, he rushes where the combat burns;
Swift to his tent the Cretan king returns:
From thence, two javelins glittering in his hand,
And clad in arms that lighten'd all the strand,
Fierce on the foe the impetuous hero drove,
Like lightning bursting from the arm of Jove,
Which to pale man the wrath of heaven declares,
Or terrifies the offending world with wars;
In streamy sparkles, kindling all the skies,
From pole to pole the trail of glory flies:
Thus his bright armour o'er the dazzled throng
Gleam'd dreadful, as the monarch flash'd along.

Him, near his tent, Meriones attends;
Whom thus he questions: "Ever best of friends!
O say, in every art of battle skill'd,
What holds thy courage from so brave a field?
On some important message art thou bound,
Or bleeds my friend by some unhappy wound?
Inglorious here, my soul abhors to stay,
And glows with prospects of th' approaching day."

"O prince! (Meriones replies) whose care
Leads forth the embattled sons of Crete to war;
This speaks my grief: this headless lance I wield;
The rest lies rooted in a Trojan shield."

To whom the Cretan: "Enter, and receive
The wonted weapons; those my tent can give;
Spears I have store, (and Trojan lances all,)
That shed a lustre round the illumined wall,
Though I, disdainful of the distant war,
Nor trust the dart, nor aim the uncertain spear,
Yet hand to hand I fight, and spoil the slain;
And thence these trophies, and these arms I gain.
Enter, and see on heaps the helmets roll'd,
And high-hung spears, and shields that flame with gold."

"Nor vain (said Merion) are our martial toils;
We too can boast of no ignoble spoils:
But those my ship contains; whence distant far,
I fight conspicuous in the van of war,
What need I more? If any Greek there be
Who knows not Merion, I appeal to thee."

To this, Idomeneus: "The fields of fight
Have proved thy valour, and unconquer'd might:
And were some ambush for the foes design'd,
Even there thy courage would not lag behind:
In that sharp service, singled from the rest,
The fear of each, or valour, stands confess'd.
No force, no firmness, the pale coward shows;
He shifts his place: his colour comes and goes:
A dropping sweat creeps cold on every part;
Against his bosom beats his quivering heart;
Terror and death in his wild eye-balls stare;
With chattering teeth he stands, and stiffening hair,
And looks a bloodless image of despair!
Not so the brave--still dauntless, still the same,
Unchanged his colour, and unmoved his frame:
Composed his thought, determined is his eye,
And fix'd his soul, to conquer or to die:
If aught disturb the tenour of his breast,
'Tis but the wish to strike before the rest.

"In such assays thy blameless worth is known,
And every art of dangerous war thy own.
By chance of fight whatever wounds you bore,
Those wounds were glorious all, and all before;
Such as may teach, 'twas still thy brave delight
T'oppose thy bosom where thy foremost fight.
But why, like infants, cold to honour's charms,
Stand we to talk, when glory calls to arms?
Go--from my conquer'd spears the choicest take,
And to their owners send them nobly back."

Swift at the word bold Merion snatch'd a spear
And, breathing slaughter, follow'd to the war.
So Mars armipotent invades the plain,
(The wide destroyer of the race of man,)
Terror, his best-beloved son, attends his course,
Arm'd with stern boldness, and enormous force;
The pride of haughty warriors to confound,
And lay the strength of tyrants on the ground:
From Thrace they fly, call'd to the dire alarms
Of warring Phlegyans, and Ephyrian arms;
Invoked by both, relentless they dispose,
To these glad conquest, murderous rout to those.
So march'd the leaders of the Cretan train,
And their bright arms shot horror o'er the plain.

Then first spake Merion: "Shall we join the right,
Or combat in the centre of the fight?
Or to the left our wonted succour lend?
Hazard and fame all parts alike attend."

"Not in the centre (Idomen replied:)
Our ablest chieftains the main battle guide;
Each godlike Ajax makes that post his care,
And gallant Teucer deals destruction there,
Skill'd or with shafts to gall the distant field,
Or bear close battle on the sounding shield.
These can the rage of haughty Hector tame:
Safe in their arms, the navy fears no flame,
Till Jove himself descends, his bolts to shed,
And hurl the blazing ruin at our head.
Great must he be, of more than human birth,
Nor feed like mortals on the fruits of earth.
Him neither rocks can crush, nor steel can wound,
Whom Ajax fells not on the ensanguined ground.
In standing fight he mates Achilles' force,
Excell'd alone in swiftness in the course.
Then to the left our ready arms apply,
And live with glory, or with glory die."

He said: and Merion to th' appointed place,
Fierce as the god of battles, urged his pace.
Soon as the foe the shining chiefs beheld
Rush like a fiery torrent o'er the field,
Their force embodied in a tide they pour;
The rising combat sounds along the shore.
As warring winds, in Sirius' sultry reign,
From different quarters sweep the sandy plain;
On every side the dusty whirlwinds rise,
And the dry fields are lifted to the skies:
Thus by despair, hope, rage, together driven,
Met the black hosts, and, meeting, darken'd heaven.
All dreadful glared the iron face of war,
Bristled with upright spears, that flash'd afar;
Dire was the gleam of breastplates, helms, and shields,
And polish'd arms emblazed the flaming fields:
Tremendous scene! that general horror gave,
But touch'd with joy the bosoms of the brave.

Saturn's great sons in fierce contention vied,
And crowds of heroes in their anger died.
The sire of earth and heaven, by Thetis won
To crown with glory Peleus' godlike son,
Will'd not destruction to the Grecian powers,
But spared awhile the destined Trojan towers;
While Neptune, rising from his azure main,
Warr'd on the king of heaven with stern disdain,
And breathed revenge, and fired the Grecian train.
Gods of one source, of one ethereal race,
Alike divine, and heaven their native place;
But Jove the greater; first-born of the skies,
And more than men, or gods, supremely wise.
For this, of Jove's superior might afraid,
Neptune in human form conceal'd his aid.
These powers enfold the Greek and Trojan train
In war and discord's adamantine chain,
Indissolubly strong: the fatal tie
Is stretch'd on both, and close compell'd they die.

Dreadful in arms, and grown in combats grey,
The bold Idomeneus controls the day.
First by his hand Othryoneus was slain,
Swell'd with false hopes, with mad ambition vain;
Call'd by the voice of war to martial fame,
From high Cabesus' distant walls he came;
Cassandra's love he sought, with boasts of power,
And promised conquest was the proffer'd dower.
The king consented, by his vaunts abused;
The king consented, but the fates refused.
Proud of himself, and of the imagined bride,
The field he measured with a larger stride.
Him as he stalk'd, the Cretan javelin found;
Vain was his breastplate to repel the wound:
His dream of glory lost, he plunged to hell;
His arms resounded as the boaster fell.
The great Idomeneus bestrides the dead;
"And thus (he cries) behold thy promise sped!
Such is the help thy arms to Ilion bring,
And such the contract of the Phrygian king!
Our offers now, illustrious prince! receive;
For such an aid what will not Argos give?
To conquer Troy, with ours thy forces join,
And count Atrides' fairest daughter thine.
Meantime, on further methods to advise,
Come, follow to the fleet thy new allies;
There hear what Greece has on her part to say."
He spoke, and dragg'd the gory corse away.
This Asius view'd, unable to contain,
Before his chariot warring on the plain:
(His crowded coursers, to his squire consign'd,
Impatient panted on his neck behind:)
To vengeance rising with a sudden spring,
He hoped the conquest of the Cretan king.
The wary Cretan, as his foe drew near,
Full on his throat discharged the forceful spear:
Beneath the chin the point was seen to glide,
And glitter'd, extant at the further side.
As when the mountain-oak, or poplar tall,
Or pine, fit mast for some great admiral,
Groans to the oft-heaved axe, with many a wound,
Then spreads a length of ruin o'er the ground:
So sunk proud Asius in that dreadful day,
And stretch'd before his much-loved coursers lay.
He grinds the dust distain'd with streaming gore,
And, fierce in death, lies foaming on the shore.
Deprived of motion, stiff with stupid fear,
Stands all aghast his trembling charioteer,
Nor shuns the foe, nor turns the steeds away,
But falls transfix'd, an unresisting prey:
Pierced by Antilochus, he pants beneath
The stately car, and labours out his breath.
Thus Asius' steeds (their mighty master gone)
Remain the prize of Nestor's youthful son.

Stabb'd at the sight, Deiphobus drew nigh,
And made, with force, the vengeful weapon fly.
The Cretan saw; and, stooping, caused to glance
From his slope shield the disappointed lance.
Beneath the spacious targe, (a blazing round,
Thick with bull-hides and brazen orbits bound,
On his raised arm by two strong braces stay'd,)
He lay collected in defensive shade.
O'er his safe head the javelin idly sung,
And on the tinkling verge more faintly rung.
Even then the spear the vigorous arm confess'd,
And pierced, obliquely, king Hypsenor's breast:
Warm'd in his liver, to the ground it bore
The chief, his people's guardian now no more!

"Not unattended (the proud Trojan cries)
Nor unrevenged, lamented Asius lies:
For thee, through hell's black portals stand display'd,
This mate shall joy thy melancholy shade."

Heart-piercing anguish, at the haughty boast,
Touch'd every Greek, but Nestor's son the most.
Grieved as he was, his pious arms attend,
And his broad buckler shields his slaughter'd friend:
Till sad Mecistheus and Alastor bore
His honour'd body to the tented shore.

Nor yet from fight Idomeneus withdraws;
Resolved to perish in his country's cause,
Or find some foe, whom heaven and he shall doom
To wail his fate in death's eternal gloom.
He sees Alcathous in the front aspire:
Great Ćsyetes was the hero's sire;
His spouse Hippodame, divinely fair,
Anchises' eldest hope, and darling care:
Who charm'd her parents' and her husband's heart
With beauty, sense, and every work of art:
He once of Ilion's youth the loveliest boy,
The fairest she of all the fair of Troy.
By Neptune now the hapless hero dies,
Who covers with a cloud those beauteous eyes,
And fetters every limb: yet bent to meet
His fate he stands; nor shuns the lance of Crete.
Fix'd as some column, or deep-rooted oak,
While the winds sleep; his breast received the stroke.
Before the ponderous stroke his corslet yields,
Long used to ward the death in fighting fields.
The riven armour sends a jarring sound;
His labouring heart heaves with so strong a bound,
The long lance shakes, and vibrates in the wound;
Fast flowing from its source, as prone he lay,
Life's purple tide impetuous gush'd away.

Then Idomen, insulting o'er the slain:
"Behold, Deiphobus! nor vaunt in vain:
See! on one Greek three Trojan ghosts attend;
This, my third victim, to the shades I send.
Approaching now thy boasted might approve,
And try the prowess of the seed of Jove.
From Jove, enamour'd of a mortal dame,
Great Minos, guardian of his country, came:
Deucalion, blameless prince, was Minos' heir;
His first-born I, the third from Jupiter:
O'er spacious Crete, and her bold sons, I reign,
And thence my ships transport me through the main:
Lord of a host, o'er all my host I shine,
A scourge to thee, thy father, and thy line."

The Trojan heard; uncertain or to meet,
Alone, with venturous arms the king of Crete,
Or seek auxiliar force; at length decreed
To call some hero to partake the deed,
Forthwith Ćneas rises to his thought:
For him in Troy's remotest lines he sought,
Where he, incensed at partial Priam, stands,
And sees superior posts in meaner hands.
To him, ambitious of so great an aid,
The bold Deiphobus approach'd, and said:

"Now, Trojan prince, employ thy pious arms,
If e'er thy bosom felt fair honour's charms.
Alcathous dies, thy brother and thy friend;
Come, and the warrior's loved remains defend.
Beneath his cares thy early youth was train'd,
One table fed you, and one roof contain'd.
This deed to fierce Idomeneus we owe;
Haste, and revenge it on th' insulting foe."

Ćneas heard, and for a space resign'd
To tender pity all his manly mind;
Then rising in his rage, he burns to fight:
The Greek awaits him with collected might.
As the fell boar, on some rough mountain's head,
Arm'd with wild terrors, and to slaughter bred,
When the loud rustics rise, and shout from far,
Attends the tumult, and expects the war;
O'er his bent back the bristly horrors rise;
Fires stream in lightning from his sanguine eyes,
His foaming tusks both dogs and men engage;
But most his hunters rouse his mighty rage:
So stood Idomeneus, his javelin shook,
And met the Trojan with a lowering look.
Antilochus, Deipyrus, were near,
The youthful offspring of the god of war,
Merion, and Aphareus, in field renown'd:
To these the warrior sent his voice around.
"Fellows in arms! your timely aid unite;
Lo, great Ćneas rushes to the fight:
Sprung from a god, and more than mortal bold;
He fresh in youth, and I in arms grown old.
Else should this hand, this hour decide the strife,
The great dispute, of glory, or of life."

He spoke, and all, as with one soul, obey'd;
Their lifted bucklers cast a dreadful shade
Around the chief. Ćneas too demands
Th' assisting forces of his native bands;
Paris, Deiphobus, Agenor, join;
(Co-aids and captains of the Trojan line;)
In order follow all th' embodied train,
Like Ida's flocks proceeding o'er the plain;
Before his fleecy care, erect and bold,
Stalks the proud ram, the father of the bold.
With joy the swain surveys them, as he leads
To the cool fountains, through the well-known meads:
So joys Ćneas, as his native band
Moves on in rank, and stretches o'er the land.

Round dread Alcathous now the battle rose;
On every side the steely circle grows;
Now batter'd breast-plates and hack'd helmets ring,
And o'er their heads unheeded javelins sing.
Above the rest, two towering chiefs appear,
There great Idomeneus, Ćneas here.
Like gods of war, dispensing fate, they stood,
And burn'd to drench the ground with mutual blood.
The Trojan weapon whizz'd along in air;
The Cretan saw, and shunn'd the brazen spear:
Sent from an arm so strong, the missive wood
Stuck deep in earth, and quiver'd where it stood.
But OEnomas received the Cretan's stroke;
The forceful spear his hollow corslet broke,
It ripp'd his belly with a ghastly wound,
And roll'd the smoking entrails on the ground.
Stretch'd on the plain, he sobs away his breath,
And, furious, grasps the bloody dust in death.
The victor from his breast the weapon tears;
His spoils he could not, for the shower of spears.
Though now unfit an active war to wage,
Heavy with cumbrous arms, stiff with cold age,
His listless limbs unable for the course,
In standing fight he yet maintains his force;
Till faint with labour, and by foes repell'd,
His tired slow steps he drags from off the field.
Deiphobus beheld him as he pass'd,
And, fired with hate, a parting javelin cast:
The javelin err'd, but held its course along,
And pierced Ascalaphus, the brave and young:
The son of Mars fell gasping on the ground,
And gnash'd the dust, all bloody with his wound.

Nor knew the furious father of his fall;
High-throned amidst the great Olympian hall,
On golden clouds th' immortal synod sate;
Detain'd from bloody war by Jove and Fate.

Now, where in dust the breathless hero lay,
For slain Ascalaphus commenced the fray,
Deiphobus to seize his helmet flies,
And from his temples rends the glittering prize;
Valiant as Mars, Meriones drew near,
And on his loaded arm discharged his spear:
He drops the weight, disabled with the pain;
The hollow helmet rings against the plain.
Swift as a vulture leaping on his prey,
From his torn arm the Grecian rent away
The reeking javelin, and rejoin'd his friends.
His wounded brother good Polites tends;
Around his waist his pious arms he threw,
And from the rage of battle gently drew:
Him his swift coursers, on his splendid car,
Rapt from the lessening thunder of the war;
To Troy they drove him, groaning from the shore,
And sprinkling, as he pass'd, the sands with gore.

Meanwhile fresh slaughter bathes the sanguine ground,
Heaps fall on heaps, and heaven and earth resound.
Bold Aphareus by great Ćneas bled;
As toward the chief he turn'd his daring head,
He pierced his throat; the bending head, depress'd
Beneath his helmet, nods upon his breast;
His shield reversed o'er the fallen warrior lies,
And everlasting slumber seals his eyes.
Antilochus, as Thoon turn'd him round,
Transpierced his back with a dishonest wound:
The hollow vein, that to the neck extends
Along the chine, his eager javelin rends:
Supine he falls, and to his social train
Spreads his imploring arms, but spreads in vain.
Th' exulting victor, leaping where he lay,
From his broad shoulders tore the spoils away;
His time observed; for closed by foes around,
On all sides thick the peals of arms resound.
His shield emboss'd the ringing storm sustains,
But he impervious and untouch'd remains.
(Great Neptune's care preserved from hostile rage
This youth, the joy of Nestor's glorious age.)
In arms intrepid, with the first he fought,
Faced every foe, and every danger sought;
His winged lance, resistless as the wind,
Obeys each motion of the master's mind!
Restless it flies, impatient to be free,
And meditates the distant enemy.
The son of Asius, Adamas, drew near,
And struck his target with the brazen spear
Fierce in his front: but Neptune wards the blow,
And blunts the javelin of th' eluded foe:
In the broad buckler half the weapon stood,
Splinter'd on earth flew half the broken wood.
Disarm'd, he mingled in the Trojan crew;
But Merion's spear o'ertook him as he flew,
Deep in the belly's rim an entrance found,
Where sharp the pang, and mortal is the wound.
Bending he fell, and doubled to the ground,
Lay panting. Thus an ox in fetters tied,
While death's strong pangs distend his labouring side,
His bulk enormous on the field displays;
His heaving heart beats thick as ebbing life decays.
The spear the conqueror from his body drew,
And death's dim shadows swarm before his view.
Next brave Deipyrus in dust was laid:
King Helenus waved high the Thracian blade,
And smote his temples with an arm so strong,
The helm fell off, and roll'd amid the throng:
There for some luckier Greek it rests a prize;
For dark in death the godlike owner lies!
Raging with grief, great Menelaus burns,
And fraught with vengeance, to the victor turns:
That shook the ponderous lance, in act to throw;
And this stood adverse with the bended bow:
Full on his breast the Trojan arrow fell,
But harmless bounded from the plated steel.
As on some ample barn's well harden'd floor,
(The winds collected at each open door,)
While the broad fan with force is whirl'd around,
Light leaps the golden grain, resulting from the ground:
So from the steel that guards Atrides' heart,
Repell'd to distance flies the bounding dart.
Atrides, watchful of the unwary foe,
Pierced with his lance the hand that grasp'd the bow.
And nailed it to the yew: the wounded hand
Trail'd the long lance that mark'd with blood the sand:
But good Agenor gently from the wound
The spear solicits, and the bandage bound;
A sling's soft wool, snatch'd from a soldier's side,
At once the tent and ligature supplied.

Behold! Pisander, urged by fate's decree,
Springs through the ranks to fall, and fall by thee,
Great Menelaus! to enchance thy fame:
High-towering in the front, the warrior came.
First the sharp lance was by Atrides thrown;
The lance far distant by the winds was blown.
Nor pierced Pisander through Atrides' shield:
Pisander's spear fell shiver'd on the field.
Not so discouraged, to the future blind,
Vain dreams of conquest swell his haughty mind;
Dauntless he rushes where the Spartan lord
Like lightning brandish'd his far beaming sword.
His left arm high opposed the shining shield:
His right beneath, the cover'd pole-axe held;
(An olive's cloudy grain the handle made,
Distinct with studs, and brazen was the blade;)
This on the helm discharged a noble blow;
The plume dropp'd nodding to the plain below,
Shorn from the crest. Atrides waved his steel:
Deep through his front the weighty falchion fell;
The crashing bones before its force gave way;
In dust and blood the groaning hero lay:
Forced from their ghastly orbs, and spouting gore,
The clotted eye-balls tumble on the shore.
And fierce Atrides spurn'd him as he bled,
Tore off his arms, and, loud-exulting, said:

"Thus, Trojans, thus, at length be taught to fear;
O race perfidious, who delight in war!
Already noble deeds ye have perform'd;
A princess raped transcends a navy storm'd:
In such bold feats your impious might approve,
Without th' assistance, or the fear of Jove.
The violated rites, the ravish'd dame;
Our heroes slaughter'd and our ships on flame,
Crimes heap'd on crimes, shall bend your glory down,
And whelm in ruins yon flagitious town.
O thou, great father! lord of earth and skies,
Above the thought of man, supremely wise!
If from thy hand the fates of mortals flow,
From whence this favour to an impious foe?
A godless crew, abandon'd and unjust,
Still breathing rapine, violence, and lust?
The best of things, beyond their measure, cloy;
Sleep's balmy blessing, love's endearing joy;
The feast, the dance; whate'er mankind desire,
Even the sweet charms of sacred numbers tire.
But Troy for ever reaps a dire delight
In thirst of slaughter, and in lust of fight."

This said, he seized (while yet the carcase heaved)
The bloody armour, which his train received:
Then sudden mix'd among the warring crew,
And the bold son of Pylaemenes slew.
Harpalion had through Asia travell'd far,
Following his martial father to the war:
Through filial love he left his native shore,
Never, ah, never to behold it more!
His unsuccessful spear he chanced to fling
Against the target of the Spartan king;
Thus of his lance disarm'd, from death he flies,
And turns around his apprehensive eyes.
Him, through the hip transpiercing as he fled,
The shaft of Merion mingled with the dead.
Beneath the bone the glancing point descends,
And, driving down, the swelling bladder rends:
Sunk in his sad companions' arms he lay,
And in short pantings sobb'd his soul away;
(Like some vile worm extended on the ground;)
While life's red torrent gush'd from out the wound.

Him on his car the Paphlagonian train
In slow procession bore from off the plain.
The pensive father, father now no more!
Attends the mournful pomp along the shore;
And unavailing tears profusely shed;
And, unrevenged, deplored his offspring dead.

Paris from far the moving sight beheld,
With pity soften'd and with fury swell'd:
His honour'd host, a youth of matchless grace,
And loved of all the Paphlagonian race!
With his full strength he bent his angry bow,
And wing'd the feather'd vengeance at the foe.
A chief there was, the brave Euchenor named,
For riches much, and more for virtue famed.
Who held his seat in Corinth's stately town;
Polydus' son, a seer of old renown.
Oft had the father told his early doom,
By arms abroad, or slow disease at home:
He climb'd his vessel, prodigal of breath,
And chose the certain glorious path to death.
Beneath his ear the pointed arrow went;
The soul came issuing at the narrow vent:
His limbs, unnerved, drop useless on the ground,
And everlasting darkness shades him round.

Nor knew great Hector how his legions yield,
(Wrapp'd in the cloud and tumult of the field:)
Wide on the left the force of Greece commands,
And conquest hovers o'er th' Achaian bands;
With such a tide superior virtue sway'd,
And he that shakes the solid earth gave aid.
But in the centre Hector fix'd remain'd,
Where first the gates were forced, and bulwarks gain'd;
There, on the margin of the hoary deep,
(Their naval station where the Ajaces keep.
And where low walls confine the beating tides,
Whose humble barrier scarce the foe divides;
Where late in fight both foot and horse engaged,
And all the thunder of the battle raged,)
There join'd, the whole Boeotian strength remains,
The proud Iaonians with their sweeping trains,
Locrians and Phthians, and th' Epaean force;
But join'd, repel not Hector's fiery course.
The flower of Athens, Stichius, Phidas, led;
Bias and great Menestheus at their head:
Meges the strong the Epaean bands controll'd,
And Dracius prudent, and Amphion bold:
The Phthians, Medon, famed for martial might,
And brave Podarces, active in the fight.
This drew from Phylacus his noble line;
Iphiclus' son: and that (Oileus) thine:
(Young Ajax' brother, by a stolen embrace;
He dwelt far distant from his native place,
By his fierce step-dame from his father's reign
Expell'd and exiled for her brother slain:)
These rule the Phthians, and their arms employ,
Mix'd with Boeotians, on the shores of Troy.

Now side by side, with like unwearied care,
Each Ajax laboured through the field of war:
So when two lordly bulls, with equal toil,
Force the bright ploughshare through the fallow soil,
Join'd to one yoke, the stubborn earth they tear,
And trace large furrows with the shining share;
O'er their huge limbs the foam descends in snow,
And streams of sweat down their sour foreheads flow.
A train of heroes followed through the field,
Who bore by turns great Ajax' sevenfold shield;
Whene'er he breathed, remissive of his might,
Tired with the incessant slaughters of the fight.
No following troops his brave associate grace:
In close engagement an unpractised race,
The Locrian squadrons nor the javelin wield,
Nor bear the helm, nor lift the moony shield;
But skill'd from far the flying shaft to wing,
Or whirl the sounding pebble from the sling,
Dexterous with these they aim a certain wound,
Or fell the distant warrior to the ground.
Thus in the van the Telamonian train,
Throng'd in bright arms, a pressing fight maintain:
Far in the rear the Locrian archers lie,
Whose stones and arrows intercept the sky,
The mingled tempest on the foes they pour;
Troy's scattering orders open to the shower.

Now had the Greeks eternal fame acquired,
And the gall'd Ilians to their walls retired;
But sage Polydamas, discreetly brave,
Address'd great Hector, and this counsel gave:

"Though great in all, thou seem'st averse to lend
Impartial audience to a faithful friend;
To gods and men thy matchless worth is known,
And every art of glorious war thy own;
But in cool thought and counsel to excel,
How widely differs this from warring well!
Content with what the bounteous gods have given,
Seek not alone to engross the gifts of Heaven.
To some the powers of bloody war belong,
To some sweet music and the charm of song;
To few, and wondrous few, has Jove assign'd
A wise, extensive, all-considering mind;
Their guardians these, the nations round confess,
And towns and empires for their safety bless.
If Heaven have lodged this virtue in my breast,
Attend, O Hector! what I judge the best,
See, as thou mov'st, on dangers dangers spread,
And war's whole fury burns around thy head.
Behold! distress'd within yon hostile wall,
How many Trojans yield, disperse, or fall!
What troops, out-number'd, scarce the war maintain!
And what brave heroes at the ships lie slain!
Here cease thy fury: and, the chiefs and kings
Convoked to council, weigh the sum of things.
Whether (the gods succeeding our desires)
To yon tall ships to bear the Trojan fires;
Or quit the fleet, and pass unhurt away,
Contented with the conquest of the day.
I fear, I fear, lest Greece, not yet undone,
Pay the large debt of last revolving sun;
Achilles, great Achilles, yet remains
On yonder decks, and yet o'erlooks the plains!"

The counsel pleased; and Hector, with a bound,
Leap'd from his chariot on the trembling ground;
Swift as he leap'd his clanging arms resound.
"To guard this post (he cried) thy art employ,
And here detain the scatter'd youth of Troy;
Where yonder heroes faint, I bend my way,
And hasten back to end the doubtful day."

This said, the towering chief prepares to go,
Shakes his white plumes that to the breezes flow,
And seems a moving mountain topp'd with snow.
Through all his host, inspiring force, he flies,
And bids anew the martial thunder rise.
To Panthus' son, at Hector's high command
Haste the bold leaders of the Trojan band:
But round the battlements, and round the plain,
For many a chief he look'd, but look'd in vain;
Deiphobus, nor Helenus the seer,
Nor Asius' son, nor Asius' self appear:
For these were pierced with many a ghastly wound,
Some cold in death, some groaning on the ground;
Some low in dust, (a mournful object) lay;
High on the wall some breathed their souls away.

Far on the left, amid the throng he found
(Cheering the troops, and dealing deaths around)
The graceful Paris; whom, with fury moved,
Opprobrious thus, th' impatient chief reproved:

"Ill-fated Paris! slave to womankind,
As smooth of face as fraudulent of mind!
Where is Deiphobus, where Asius gone?
The godlike father, and th' intrepid son?
The force of Helenus, dispensing fate;
And great Othryoneus, so fear'd of late?
Black fate hang's o'er thee from th' avenging gods,
Imperial Troy from her foundations nods;
Whelm'd in thy country's ruin shalt thou fall,
And one devouring vengeance swallow all."

When Paris thus: "My brother and my friend,
Thy warm impatience makes thy tongue offend,
In other battles I deserved thy blame,
Though then not deedless, nor unknown to fame:
But since yon rampart by thy arms lay low,
I scatter'd slaughter from my fatal bow.
The chiefs you seek on yonder shore lie slain;
Of all those heroes, two alone remain;
Deiphobus, and Helenus the seer,
Each now disabled by a hostile spear.
Go then, successful, where thy soul inspires:
This heart and hand shall second all thy fires:
What with this arm I can, prepare to know,
Till death for death be paid, and blow for blow.
But 'tis not ours, with forces not our own
To combat: strength is of the gods alone."
These words the hero's angry mind assuage:
Then fierce they mingle where the thickest rage.
Around Polydamas, distain'd with blood,
Cebrion, Phalces, stern Orthaeus stood,
Palmus, with Polypoetes the divine,
And two bold brothers of Hippotion's line
(Who reach'd fair Ilion, from Ascania far,
The former day; the next engaged in war).
As when from gloomy clouds a whirlwind springs,
That bears Jove's thunder on its dreadful wings,
Wide o'er the blasted fields the tempest sweeps;
Then, gather'd, settles on the hoary deeps;
The afflicted deeps tumultuous mix and roar;
The waves behind impel the waves before,
Wide rolling, foaming high, and tumbling to the shore:
Thus rank on rank, the thick battalions throng,
Chief urged on chief, and man drove man along.
Far o'er the plains, in dreadful order bright,
The brazen arms reflect a beamy light:
Full in the blazing van great Hector shined,
Like Mars commission'd to confound mankind.
Before him flaming his enormous shield,
Like the broad sun, illumined all the field;
His nodding helm emits a streamy ray;
His piercing eyes through all the battle stray,
And, while beneath his targe he flash'd along,
Shot terrors round, that wither'd e'en the strong.

Thus stalk'd he, dreadful; death was in his look:
Whole nations fear'd; but not an Argive shook.
The towering Ajax, with an ample stride,
Advanced the first, and thus the chief defied:

"Hector! come on; thy empty threats forbear;
'Tis not thy arm, 'tis thundering Jove we fear:
The skill of war to us not idly given,
Lo! Greece is humbled, not by Troy, but Heaven.
Vain are the hopes that haughty mind imparts,
To force our fleet: the Greeks have hands and hearts.
Long ere in flames our lofty navy fall,
Your boasted city, and your god-built wall,
Shall sink beneath us, smoking on the ground;
And spread a long unmeasured ruin round.
The time shall come, when, chased along the plain,
Even thou shalt call on Jove, and call in vain;
Even thou shalt wish, to aid thy desperate course,
The wings of falcons for thy flying horse;
Shalt run, forgetful of a warrior's fame,
While clouds of friendly dust conceal thy shame."

As thus he spoke, behold, in open view,
On sounding wings a dexter eagle flew.
To Jove's glad omen all the Grecians rise,
And hail, with shouts, his progress through the skies:
Far-echoing clamours bound from side to side;
They ceased; and thus the chief of Troy replied:

"From whence this menace, this insulting strain?
Enormous boaster! doom'd to vaunt in vain.
So may the gods on Hector life bestow,
(Not that short life which mortals lead below,
But such as those of Jove's high lineage born,
The blue-eyed maid, or he that gilds the morn,)
As this decisive day shall end the fame
Of Greece, and Argos be no more a name.
And thou, imperious! if thy madness wait
The lance of Hector, thou shalt meet thy fate:
That giant-corse, extended on the shore,
Shall largely feast the fowls with fat and gore."

He said; and like a lion stalk'd along:
With shouts incessant earth and ocean rung,
Sent from his following host: the Grecian train
With answering thunders fill'd the echoing plain;
A shout that tore heaven's concave, and, above,
Shook the fix'd splendours of the throne of Jove.

BOOK XIV.


ARGUMENT.(231)

JUNO DECEIVES JUPITER BY THE GIRDLE OF VENUS.

Nestor, sitting at the table with Machaon, is alarmed with the increasing
clamour of war, and hastens to Agamemnon; on his way he meets that prince
with Diomed and Ulysses, whom he informs of the extremity of the danger.
Agamemnon proposes to make their escape by night, which Ulysses
withstands; to which Diomed adds his advice, that, wounded as they were,
they should go forth and encourage the army with their presence, which
advice is pursued. Juno, seeing the partiality of Jupiter to the Trojans,
forms a design to over-reach him: she sets off her charms with the utmost
care, and (the more surely to enchant him) obtains the magic girdle of
Venus. She then applies herself to the god of sleep, and, with some
difficulty, persuades him to seal the eyes of Jupiter: this done, she goes
to mount Ida, where the god, at first sight, is ravished with her beauty,
sinks in her embraces, and is laid asleep. Neptune takes advantage of his
slumber, and succours the Greeks: Hector is struck to the ground with a
prodigious stone by Ajax, and carried off from the battle: several actions
succeed, till the Trojans, much distressed, are obliged to give way: the
lesser Ajax signalizes himself in a particular manner.

But not the genial feast, nor flowing bowl,
Could charm the cares of Nestor's watchful soul;
His startled ears the increasing cries attend;
Then thus, impatient, to his wounded friend:

"What new alarm, divine Machaon, say,
What mix'd events attend this mighty day?
Hark! how the shouts divide, and how they meet,
And now come full, and thicken to the fleet!
Here with the cordial draught dispel thy care,
Let Hecamede the strengthening bath prepare,
Refresh thy wound, and cleanse the clotted gore;
While I the adventures of the day explore."

He said: and, seizing Thrasymedes' shield,
(His valiant offspring,) hasten'd to the field;
(That day the son his father's buckler bore;)
Then snatch'd a lance, and issued from the door.
Soon as the prospect open'd to his view,
His wounded eyes the scene of sorrow knew;
Dire disarray! the tumult of the fight,
The wall in ruins, and the Greeks in flight.
As when old ocean's silent surface sleeps,
The waves just heaving on the purple deeps:
While yet the expected tempest hangs on high,
Weighs down the cloud, and blackens in the sky,
The mass of waters will no wind obey;
Jove sends one gust, and bids them roll away.
While wavering counsels thus his mind engage,
Fluctuates in doubtful thought the Pylian sage,
To join the host, or to the general haste;
Debating long, he fixes on the last:
Yet, as he moves, the sight his bosom warms,
The field rings dreadful with the clang of arms,
The gleaming falchions flash, the javelins fly;
Blows echo blows, and all or kill or die.

Him, in his march, the wounded princes meet,
By tardy steps ascending from the fleet:
The king of men, Ulysses the divine,
And who to Tydeus owes his noble line.(232)
(Their ships at distance from the battle stand,
In lines advanced along the shelving strand:
Whose bay, the fleet unable to contain
At length; beside the margin of the main,
Rank above rank, the crowded ships they moor:
Who landed first, lay highest on the shore.)
Supported on the spears, they took their way,
Unfit to fight, but anxious for the day.
Nestor's approach alarm'd each Grecian breast,
Whom thus the general of the host address'd:

"O grace and glory of the Achaian name;
What drives thee, Nestor, from the field of fame?
Shall then proud Hector see his boast fulfill'd,
Our fleets in ashes, and our heroes kill'd?
Such was his threat, ah! now too soon made good,
On many a Grecian bosom writ in blood.
Is every heart inflamed with equal rage
Against your king, nor will one chief engage?
And have I lived to see with mournful eyes
In every Greek a new Achilles rise?"

Gerenian Nestor then: "So fate has will'd;
And all-confirming time has fate fulfill'd.
Not he that thunders from the aerial bower,
Not Jove himself, upon the past has power.
The wall, our late inviolable bound,
And best defence, lies smoking on the ground:
Even to the ships their conquering arms extend,
And groans of slaughter'd Greeks to heaven ascend.
On speedy measures then employ your thought
In such distress! if counsel profit aught:
Arms cannot much: though Mars our souls incite,
These gaping wounds withhold us from the fight."

To him the monarch: "That our army bends,
That Troy triumphant our high fleet ascends,
And that the rampart, late our surest trust
And best defence, lies smoking in the dust;
All this from Jove's afflictive hand we bear,
Who, far from Argos, wills our ruin here.
Past are the days when happier Greece was blest,
And all his favour, all his aid confess'd;
Now heaven averse, our hands from battle ties,
And lifts the Trojan glory to the skies.
Cease we at length to waste our blood in vain,
And launch what ships lie nearest to the main;
Leave these at anchor, till the coming night:
Then, if impetuous Troy forbear the fight,
Bring all to sea, and hoist each sail for flight.
Better from evils, well foreseen, to run,
Than perish in the danger we may shun."

Thus he. The sage Ulysses thus replies,
While anger flash'd from his disdainful eyes:
"What shameful words (unkingly as thou art)
Fall from that trembling tongue and timorous heart?
Oh were thy sway the curse of meaner powers,
And thou the shame of any host but ours!
A host, by Jove endued with martial might,
And taught to conquer, or to fall in fight:
Adventurous combats and bold wars to wage,
Employ'd our youth, and yet employs our age.
And wilt thou thus desert the Trojan plain?
And have whole streams of blood been spilt in vain?
In such base sentence if thou couch thy fear,
Speak it in whispers, lest a Greek should hear.
Lives there a man so dead to fame, who dares
To think such meanness, or the thought declares?
And comes it even from him whose sovereign sway
The banded legions of all Greece obey?
Is this a general's voice that calls to flight,
While war hangs doubtful, while his soldiers fight?
What more could Troy? What yet their fate denies
Thou givest the foe: all Greece becomes their prize.
No more the troops (our hoisted sails in view,
Themselves abandon'd) shall the fight pursue;
But thy ships flying, with despair shall see;
And owe destruction to a prince like thee."

"Thy just reproofs (Atrides calm replies)
Like arrows pierce me, for thy words are wise.
Unwilling as I am to lose the host,
I force not Greece to quit this hateful coast;
Glad I submit, whoe'er, or young, or old,
Aught, more conducive to our weal, unfold."

Tydides cut him short, and thus began:
"Such counsel if you seek, behold the man
Who boldly gives it, and what he shall say,
Young though he be, disdain not to obey:
A youth, who from the mighty Tydeus springs,
May speak to councils and assembled kings.
Hear then in me the great OEnides' son,
Whose honoured dust (his race of glory run)
Lies whelm'd in ruins of the Theban wall;
Brave in his life, and glorious in his fall.
With three bold sons was generous Prothous bless'd,
Who Pleuron's walls and Calydon possess'd;
Melas and Agrius, but (who far surpass'd
The rest in courage) OEneus was the last.
From him, my sire. From Calydon expell'd,
He pass'd to Argos, and in exile dwell'd;
The monarch's daughter there (so Jove ordain'd)
He won, and flourish'd where Adrastus reign'd;
There, rich in fortune's gifts, his acres till'd,
Beheld his vines their liquid harvest yield,
And numerous flocks that whiten'd all the field.
Such Tydeus was, the foremost once in fame!
Nor lives in Greece a stranger to his name.
Then, what for common good my thoughts inspire,
Attend, and in the son respect the sire.
Though sore of battle, though with wounds oppress'd,
Let each go forth, and animate the rest,
Advance the glory which he cannot share,
Though not partaker, witness of the war.
But lest new wounds on wounds o'erpower us quite,
Beyond the missile javelin's sounding flight,
Safe let us stand; and, from the tumult far,
Inspire the ranks, and rule the distant war."

He added not: the listening kings obey,
Slow moving on; Atrides leads the way.
The god of ocean (to inflame their rage)
Appears a warrior furrowed o'er with age;
Press'd in his own, the general's hand he took,
And thus the venerable hero spoke:

"Atrides! lo! with what disdainful eye
Achilles sees his country's forces fly;
Blind, impious man! whose anger is his guide,
Who glories in unutterable pride.
So may he perish, so may Jove disclaim
The wretch relentless, and o'erwhelm with shame!
But Heaven forsakes not thee: o'er yonder sands
Soon shall thou view the scattered Trojan bands
Fly diverse; while proud kings, and chiefs renown'd,
Driven heaps on heaps, with clouds involved around
Of rolling dust, their winged wheels employ
To hide their ignominious heads in Troy."

He spoke, then rush'd amid the warrior crew,
And sent his voice before him as he flew,
Loud, as the shout encountering armies yield
When twice ten thousand shake the labouring field;
Such was the voice, and such the thundering sound
Of him whose trident rends the solid ground.
Each Argive bosom beats to meet the fight,
And grisly war appears a pleasing sight.

Meantime Saturnia from Olympus' brow,
High-throned in gold, beheld the fields below;
With joy the glorious conflict she survey'd,
Where her great brother gave the Grecians aid.
But placed aloft, on Ida's shady height
She sees her Jove, and trembles at the sight.
Jove to deceive, what methods shall she try,
What arts, to blind his all-beholding eye?
At length she trusts her power; resolved to prove
The old, yet still successful, cheat of love;
Against his wisdom to oppose her charms,
And lull the lord of thunders in her arms.

Swift to her bright apartment she repairs,
Sacred to dress and beauty's pleasing cares:
With skill divine had Vulcan form'd the bower,
Safe from access of each intruding power.
Touch'd with her secret key, the doors unfold:
Self-closed, behind her shut the valves of gold.
Here first she bathes; and round her body pours
Soft oils of fragrance, and ambrosial showers:
The winds, perfumed, the balmy gale convey
Through heaven, through earth, and all the aerial way:
Spirit divine! whose exhalation greets
The sense of gods with more than mortal sweets.
Thus while she breathed of heaven, with decent pride
Her artful hands the radiant tresses tied;
Part on her head in shining ringlets roll'd,
Part o'er her shoulders waved like melted gold.
Around her next a heavenly mantle flow'd,
That rich with Pallas' labour'd colours glow'd:
Large clasps of gold the foldings gather'd round,
A golden zone her swelling bosom bound.
Far-beaming pendants tremble in her ear,
Each gem illumined with a triple star.
Then o'er her head she cast a veil more white
Than new-fallen snow, and dazzling as the light.
Last her fair feet celestial sandals grace.
Thus issuing radiant with majestic pace,
Forth from the dome the imperial goddess moves,
And calls the mother of the smiles and loves.

"How long (to Venus thus apart she cried)
Shall human strife celestial minds divide?
Ah yet, will Venus aid Saturnia's joy,
And set aside the cause of Greece and Troy?"

"Let heaven's dread empress (Cytheraea said)
Speak her request, and deem her will obey'd."

"Then grant me (said the queen) those conquering charms,
That power, which mortals and immortals warms,
That love, which melts mankind in fierce desires,
And burns the sons of heaven with sacred fires!

"For lo! I haste to those remote abodes,
Where the great parents, (sacred source of gods!)
Ocean and Tethys their old empire keep,
On the last limits of the land and deep.
In their kind arms my tender years were past;
What time old Saturn, from Olympus cast,
Of upper heaven to Jove resign'd the reign,
Whelm'd under the huge mass of earth and main.
For strife, I hear, has made the union cease,
Which held so long that ancient pair in peace.
What honour, and what love, shall I obtain,
If I compose those fatal feuds again;
Once more their minds in mutual ties engage,
And, what my youth has owed, repay their age!"

She said. With awe divine, the queen of love
Obey'd the sister and the wife of Jove;
And from her fragrant breast the zone embraced,(233)
With various skill and high embroidery graced.
In this was every art, and every charm,
To win the wisest, and the coldest warm:
Fond love, the gentle vow, the gay desire,
The kind deceit, the still-reviving fire,
Persuasive speech, and the more persuasive sighs,
Silence that spoke, and eloquence of eyes.
This on her hand the Cyprian Goddess laid:
"Take this, and with it all thy wish;" she said.
With smiles she took the charm; and smiling press'd
The powerful cestus to her snowy breast.

Then Venus to the courts of Jove withdrew;
Whilst from Olympus pleased Saturnia flew.
O'er high Pieria thence her course she bore,
O'er fair Emathia's ever-pleasing shore,
O'er Hemus' hills with snows eternal crown'd;
Nor once her flying foot approach'd the ground.
Then taking wing from Athos' lofty steep,
She speeds to Lemnos o'er the rolling deep,
And seeks the cave of Death's half-brother, Sleep.(234)

"Sweet pleasing Sleep! (Saturnia thus began)
Who spread'st thy empire o'er each god and man;
If e'er obsequious to thy Juno's will,
O power of slumbers! hear, and favour still.
Shed thy soft dews on Jove's immortal eyes,
While sunk in love's entrancing joys he lies.
A splendid footstool, and a throne, that shine
With gold unfading, Somnus, shall be thine;
The work of Vulcan; to indulge thy ease,
When wine and feasts thy golden humours please."

"Imperial dame (the balmy power replies),
Great Saturn's heir, and empress of the skies!
O'er other gods I spread my easy chain;
The sire of all, old Ocean, owns my reign.
And his hush'd waves lie silent on the main.
But how, unbidden, shall I dare to steep
Jove's awful temples in the dew of sleep?
Long since, too venturous, at thy bold command,
On those eternal lids I laid my hand;
What time, deserting Ilion's wasted plain,
His conquering son, Alcides, plough'd the main.
When lo! the deeps arise, the tempests roar,
And drive the hero to the Coan shore:
Great Jove, awaking, shook the blest abodes
With rising wrath, and tumbled gods on gods;
Me chief he sought, and from the realms on high
Had hurl'd indignant to the nether sky,
But gentle Night, to whom I fled for aid,
(The friend of earth and heaven,) her wings display'd;
Impower'd the wrath of gods and men to tame,
Even Jove revered the venerable dame."

"Vain are thy fears (the queen of heaven replies,
And, speaking, rolls her large majestic eyes);
Think'st thou that Troy has Jove's high favour won,
Like great Alcides, his all-conquering son?
Hear, and obey the mistress of the skies,
Nor for the deed expect a vulgar prize;
For know, thy loved-one shall be ever thine,
The youngest Grace, Pasithae the divine."(235)

"Swear then (he said) by those tremendous floods
That roar through hell, and bind the invoking gods:
Let the great parent earth one hand sustain,
And stretch the other o'er the sacred main:
Call the black Titans, that with Chronos dwell,
To hear and witness from the depths of hell;
That she, my loved-one, shall be ever mine,
The youngest Grace, Pasithae the divine."

The queen assents, and from the infernal bowers
Invokes the sable subtartarean powers,
And those who rule the inviolable floods,
Whom mortals name the dread Titanian gods.

Then swift as wind, o'er Lemnos' smoky isle
They wing their way, and Imbrus' sea-beat soil;
Through air, unseen, involved in darkness glide,
And light on Lectos, on the point of Ide:
(Mother of savages, whose echoing hills
Are heard resounding with a hundred rills:)
Fair Ida trembles underneath the god;
Hush'd are her mountains, and her forests nod.
There on a fir, whose spiry branches rise
To join its summit to the neighbouring skies;
Dark in embowering shade, conceal'd from sight,
Sat Sleep, in likeness of the bird of night.
(Chalcis his name by those of heavenly birth,
But call'd Cymindis by the race of earth.)

To Ida's top successful Juno flies;
Great Jove surveys her with desiring eyes:
The god, whose lightning sets the heavens on fire,
Through all his bosom feels the fierce desire;
Fierce as when first by stealth he seized her charms,
Mix'd with her soul, and melted in her arms:
Fix'd on her eyes he fed his eager look,
Then press'd her hand, and thus with transport spoke:

"Why comes my goddess from the ethereal sky,
And not her steeds and flaming chariot nigh?"

Then she--"I haste to those remote abodes
Where the great parents of the deathless gods,
The reverend Ocean and gray Tethys, reign,
On the last limits of the land and main.
I visit these, to whose indulgent cares
I owe the nursing of my tender years:
For strife, I hear, has made that union cease
Which held so long that ancient pair in peace.
The steeds, prepared my chariot to convey
O'er earth and seas, and through the aerial way,
Wait under Ide: of thy superior power
To ask consent, I leave the Olympian bower;
Nor seek, unknown to thee, the sacred cells
Deep under seas, where hoary Ocean dwells."

"For that (said Jove) suffice another day!
But eager love denies the least delay.
Let softer cares the present hour employ,
And be these moments sacred all to joy.
Ne'er did my soul so strong a passion prove,
Or for an earthly, or a heavenly love:
Not when I press'd Ixion's matchless dame,
Whence rose Pirithous like the gods in fame:
Not when fair Danae felt the shower of gold
Stream into life, whence Perseus brave and bold.
Not thus I burn'd for either Theban dame:
(Bacchus from this, from that Alcides came:)
Nor Phoenix' daughter, beautiful and young,
Whence godlike Rhadamanth and Minos sprung.(236)
Not thus I burn'd for fair Latona's face,
Nor comelier Ceres' more majestic grace.
Not thus even for thyself I felt desire,
As now my veins receive the pleasing fire."

He spoke; the goddess with the charming eyes
Glows with celestial red, and thus replies:
"Is this a scene for love? On Ida's height,
Exposed to mortal and immortal sight!
Our joys profaned by each familiar eye;
The sport of heaven, and fable of the sky:
How shall I e'er review the blest abodes,
Or mix among the senate of the gods?
Shall I not think, that, with disorder'd charms,
All heaven beholds me recent from thy arms?
With skill divine has Vulcan form'd thy bower,
Sacred to love and to the genial hour;
If such thy will, to that recess retire,
In secret there indulge thy soft desire."

She ceased; and, smiling with superior love,
Thus answer'd mild the cloud-compelling Jove:
"Nor god nor mortal shall our joys behold,
Shaded with clouds, and circumfused in gold;
Not even the sun, who darts through heaven his rays,
And whose broad eye the extended earth surveys."

Gazing he spoke, and, kindling at the view,
His eager arms around the goddess threw.
Glad Earth perceives, and from her bosom pours
Unbidden herbs and voluntary flowers:
Thick new-born violets a soft carpet spread,
And clustering lotos swell'd the rising bed,
And sudden hyacinths the turf bestrow,(237)
And flamy crocus made the mountain glow
There golden clouds conceal the heavenly pair,
Steep'd in soft joys and circumfused with air;
Celestial dews, descending o'er the ground,
Perfume the mount, and breathe ambrosia round:
At length, with love and sleep's soft power oppress'd,
The panting thunderer nods, and sinks to rest.

Now to the navy borne on silent wings,
To Neptune's ear soft Sleep his message brings;
Beside him sudden, unperceived, he stood,
And thus with gentle words address'd the god:

"Now, Neptune! now, the important hour employ,
To check a while the haughty hopes of Troy:
While Jove yet rests, while yet my vapours shed
The golden vision round his sacred head;
For Juno's love, and Somnus' pleasing ties,
Have closed those awful and eternal eyes."
Thus having said, the power of slumber flew,
On human lids to drop the balmy dew.
Neptune, with zeal increased, renews his care,
And towering in the foremost ranks of war,
Indignant thus--"Oh once of martial fame!
O Greeks! if yet ye can deserve the name!
This half-recover'd day shall Troy obtain?
Shall Hector thunder at your ships again?
Lo! still he vaunts, and threats the fleet with fires,
While stern Achilles in his wrath retires.
One hero's loss too tamely you deplore,
Be still yourselves, and ye shall need no more.
Oh yet, if glory any bosom warms,
Brace on your firmest helms, and stand to arms:
His strongest spear each valiant Grecian wield,
Each valiant Grecian seize his broadest shield;
Let to the weak the lighter arms belong,
The ponderous targe be wielded by the strong.
Thus arm'd, not Hector shall our presence stay;
Myself, ye Greeks! myself will lead the way."

                    [Illustration: GREEK SHIELD.]

                            GREEK SHIELD.


The troops assent; their martial arms they change:
The busy chiefs their banded legions range.
The kings, though wounded, and oppress'd with pain,
With helpful hands themselves assist the train.
The strong and cumbrous arms the valiant wield,
The weaker warrior takes a lighter shield.
Thus sheath'd in shining brass, in bright array
The legions march, and Neptune leads the way:
His brandish'd falchion flames before their eyes,
Like lightning flashing through the frighted skies.
Clad in his might, the earth-shaking power appears;
Pale mortals tremble, and confess their fears.

Troy's great defender stands alone unawed,
Arms his proud host, and dares oppose a god:
And lo! the god, and wondrous man, appear:
The sea's stern ruler there, and Hector here.
The roaring main, at her great master's call,
Rose in huge ranks, and form'd a watery wall
Around the ships: seas hanging o'er the shores,
Both armies join: earth thunders, ocean roars.
Not half so loud the bellowing deeps resound,
When stormy winds disclose the dark profound;
Less loud the winds that from the Ćolian hall
Roar through the woods, and make whole forests fall;
Less loud the woods, when flames in torrents pour,
Catch the dry mountain, and its shades devour;
With such a rage the meeting hosts are driven,
And such a clamour shakes the sounding heaven.
The first bold javelin, urged by Hector's force,
Direct at Ajax' bosom winged its course;
But there no pass the crossing belts afford,
(One braced his shield, and one sustain'd his sword.)
Then back the disappointed Trojan drew,
And cursed the lance that unavailing flew:
But 'scaped not Ajax; his tempestuous hand
A ponderous stone upheaving from the sand,
(Where heaps laid loose beneath the warrior's feet,
Or served to ballast, or to prop the fleet,)
Toss'd round and round, the missive marble flings;
On the razed shield the fallen ruin rings,
Full on his breast and throat with force descends;
Nor deaden'd there its giddy fury spends,
But whirling on, with many a fiery round,
Smokes in the dust, and ploughs into the ground.
As when the bolt, red-hissing from above,
Darts on the consecrated plant of Jove,
The mountain-oak in flaming ruin lies,
Black from the blow, and smokes of sulphur rise;
Stiff with amaze the pale beholders stand,
And own the terrors of the almighty hand!
So lies great Hector prostrate on the shore;
His slacken'd hand deserts the lance it bore;
His following shield the fallen chief o'erspread;
Beneath his helmet dropp'd his fainting head;
His load of armour, sinking to the ground,
Clanks on the field, a dead and hollow sound.
Loud shouts of triumph fill the crowded plain;
Greece sees, in hope, Troy's great defender slain:
All spring to seize him; storms of arrows fly,
And thicker javelins intercept the sky.
In vain an iron tempest hisses round;
He lies protected, and without a wound.(238)
Polydamas, Agenor the divine,
The pious warrior of Anchises' line,
And each bold leader of the Lycian band,
With covering shields (a friendly circle) stand,
His mournful followers, with assistant care,
The groaning hero to his chariot bear;
His foaming coursers, swifter than the wind,
Speed to the town, and leave the war behind.

When now they touch'd the mead's enamell'd side,
Where gentle Xanthus rolls his easy tide,
With watery drops the chief they sprinkle round,
Placed on the margin of the flowery ground.
Raised on his knees, he now ejects the gore;
Now faints anew, low-sinking on the shore;
By fits he breathes, half views the fleeting skies,
And seals again, by fits, his swimming eyes.

Soon as the Greeks the chief's retreat beheld,
With double fury each invades the field.
Oilean Ajax first his javelin sped,
Pierced by whose point the son of Enops bled;
(Satnius the brave, whom beauteous Neis bore
Amidst her flocks on Satnio's silver shore;)
Struck through the belly's rim, the warrior lies
Supine, and shades eternal veil his eyes.
An arduous battle rose around the dead;
By turns the Greeks, by turns the Trojans bled.

Fired with revenge, Polydamas drew near,
And at Prothoenor shook the trembling spear;
The driving javelin through his shoulder thrust,
He sinks to earth, and grasps the bloody dust.
"Lo thus (the victor cries) we rule the field,
And thus their arms the race of Panthus wield:
From this unerring hand there flies no dart
But bathes its point within a Grecian heart.
Propp'd on that spear to which thou owest thy fall,
Go, guide thy darksome steps to Pluto's dreary hall."

He said, and sorrow touch'd each Argive breast:
The soul of Ajax burn'd above the rest.
As by his side the groaning warrior fell,
At the fierce foe he launch'd his piercing steel;
The foe, reclining, shunn'd the flying death;
But fate, Archilochus, demands thy breath:
Thy lofty birth no succour could impart,
The wings of death o'ertook thee on the dart;
Swift to perform heaven's fatal will, it fled
Full on the juncture of the neck and head,
And took the joint, and cut the nerves in twain:
The dropping head first tumbled on the plain.
So just the stroke, that yet the body stood
Erect, then roll'd along the sands in blood.

"Here, proud Polydamas, here turn thy eyes!
(The towering Ajax loud-insulting cries:)
Say, is this chief extended on the plain
A worthy vengeance for Prothoenor slain?
Mark well his port! his figure and his face
Nor speak him vulgar, nor of vulgar race;
Some lines, methinks, may make his lineage known,
Antenor's brother, or perhaps his son."

He spake, and smiled severe, for well he knew
The bleeding youth: Troy sadden'd at the view.
But furious Acamas avenged his cause;
As Promachus his slaughtered brother draws,
He pierced his heart--"Such fate attends you all,
Proud Argives! destined by our arms to fall.
Not Troy alone, but haughty Greece, shall share
The toils, the sorrows, and the wounds of war.
Behold your Promachus deprived of breath,
A victim owed to my brave brother's death.
Not unappeased he enters Pluto's gate,
Who leaves a brother to revenge his fate."

Heart-piercing anguish struck the Grecian host,
But touch'd the breast of bold Peneleus most;
At the proud boaster he directs his course;
The boaster flies, and shuns superior force.
But young Ilioneus received the spear;
Ilioneus, his father's only care:
(Phorbas the rich, of all the Trojan train
Whom Hermes loved, and taught the arts of gain:)
Full in his eye the weapon chanced to fall,
And from the fibres scoop'd the rooted ball,
Drove through the neck, and hurl'd him to the plain;
He lifts his miserable arms in vain!
Swift his broad falchion fierce Peneleus spread,
And from the spouting shoulders struck his head;
To earth at once the head and helmet fly;
The lance, yet sticking through the bleeding eye,
The victor seized; and, as aloft he shook
The gory visage, thus insulting spoke:

"Trojans! your great Ilioneus behold!
Haste, to his father let the tale be told:
Let his high roofs resound with frantic woe,
Such as the house of Promachus must know;
Let doleful tidings greet his mother's ear,
Such as to Promachus' sad spouse we bear,
When we victorious shall to Greece return,
And the pale matron in our triumphs mourn."

Dreadful he spoke, then toss'd the head on high;
The Trojans hear, they tremble, and they fly:
Aghast they gaze around the fleet and wall,
And dread the ruin that impends on all.

Daughters of Jove! that on Olympus shine,
Ye all-beholding, all-recording nine!
O say, when Neptune made proud Ilion yield,
What chief, what hero first embrued the field?
Of all the Grecians what immortal name,
And whose bless'd trophies, will ye raise to fame?

Thou first, great Ajax! on the unsanguined plain
Laid Hyrtius, leader of the Mysian train.
Phalces and Mermer, Nestor's son o'erthrew,
Bold Merion, Morys and Hippotion slew.
Strong Periphaetes and Prothoon bled,
By Teucer's arrows mingled with the dead,
Pierced in the flank by Menelaus' steel,
His people's pastor, Hyperenor fell;
Eternal darkness wrapp'd the warrior round,
And the fierce soul came rushing through the wound.
But stretch'd in heaps before Oileus' son,
Fall mighty numbers, mighty numbers run;
Ajax the less, of all the Grecian race
Skill'd in pursuit, and swiftest in the chase.

BOOK XV.


ARGUMENT.

THE FIFTH BATTLE AT THE SHIPS; AND THE ACTS OF AJAX.

Jupiter, awaking, sees the Trojans repulsed from the trenches, Hector in a
swoon, and Neptune at the head of the Greeks: he is highly incensed at the
artifice of Juno, who appeases him by her submissions; she is then sent to
Iris and Apollo. Juno, repairing to the assembly of the gods, attempts,
with extraordinary address, to incense them against Jupiter; in particular
she touches Mars with a violent resentment; he is ready to take arms, but
is prevented by Minerva. Iris and Apollo obey the orders of Jupiter; Iris
commands Neptune to leave the battle, to which, after much reluctance and
passion, he consents. Apollo reinspires Hector with vigour, brings him
back to the battle, marches before him with his aegis, and turns the
fortune of the fight. He breaks down great part of the Grecian wall: the
Trojans rush in, and attempt to fire the first line of the fleet, but are,
as yet, repelled by the greater Ajax with a prodigious slaughter.

Now in swift flight they pass the trench profound,
And many a chief lay gasping on the ground:
Then stopp'd and panted, where the chariots lie
Fear on their cheek, and horror in their eye.
Meanwhile, awaken'd from his dream of love,
On Ida's summit sat imperial Jove:
Round the wide fields he cast a careful view,
There saw the Trojans fly, the Greeks pursue;
These proud in arms, those scatter'd o'er the plain
And, 'midst the war, the monarch of the main.
Not far, great Hector on the dust he spies,
(His sad associates round with weeping eyes,)
Ejecting blood, and panting yet for breath,
His senses wandering to the verge of death.
The god beheld him with a pitying look,
And thus, incensed, to fraudful Juno spoke:

"O thou, still adverse to the eternal will,
For ever studious in promoting ill!
Thy arts have made the godlike Hector yield,
And driven his conquering squadrons from the field.
Canst thou, unhappy in thy wiles, withstand
Our power immense, and brave the almighty hand?
Hast thou forgot, when, bound and fix'd on high,
From the vast concave of the spangled sky,
I hung thee trembling in a golden chain,
And all the raging gods opposed in vain?
Headlong I hurl'd them from the Olympian hall,
Stunn'd in the whirl, and breathless with the fall.
For godlike Hercules these deeds were done,
Nor seem'd the vengeance worthy such a son:
When, by thy wiles induced, fierce Boreas toss'd
The shipwreck'd hero on the Coan coast,
Him through a thousand forms of death I bore,
And sent to Argos, and his native shore.
Hear this, remember, and our fury dread,
Nor pull the unwilling vengeance on thy head;
Lest arts and blandishments successless prove,
Thy soft deceits, and well-dissembled love."

The Thunderer spoke: imperial Juno mourn'd,
And, trembling, these submissive words return'd:

"By every oath that powers immortal ties,
The foodful earth and all-infolding skies;
By thy black waves, tremendous Styx! that flow
Through the drear realms of gliding ghosts below;
By the dread honours of thy sacred head,
And that unbroken vow, our virgin bed!
Not by my arts the ruler of the main
Steeps Troy in blood, and ranges round the plain:
By his own ardour, his own pity sway'd,
To help his Greeks, he fought and disobey'd:
Else had thy Juno better counsels given,
And taught submission to the sire of heaven."

"Think'st thou with me? fair empress of the skies!
(The immortal father with a smile replies;)
Then soon the haughty sea-god shall obey,
Nor dare to act but when we point the way.
If truth inspires thy tongue, proclaim our will
To yon bright synod on the Olympian hill;
Our high decree let various Iris know,
And call the god that bears the silver bow.
Let her descend, and from the embattled plain
Command the sea-god to his watery reign:
While Phoebus hastes great Hector to prepare
To rise afresh, and once more wake the war:
His labouring bosom re-inspires with breath,
And calls his senses from the verge of death.
Greece chased by Troy, even to Achilles' fleet,
Shall fall by thousands at the hero's feet.
He, not untouch'd with pity, to the plain
Shall send Patroclus, but shall send in vain.
What youths he slaughters under Ilion's walls!
Even my loved son, divine Sarpedon, falls!
Vanquish'd at last by Hector's lance he lies.
Then, nor till then, shall great Achilles rise:
And lo! that instant, godlike Hector dies.
From that great hour the war's whole fortune turns,
Pallas assists, and lofty Ilion burns.
Not till that day shall Jove relax his rage,
Nor one of all the heavenly host engage
In aid of Greece. The promise of a god
I gave, and seal'd it with the almighty nod,
Achilles' glory to the stars to raise;
Such was our word, and fate the word obeys."

The trembling queen (the almighty order given)
Swift from the Idaean summit shot to heaven.
As some wayfaring man, who wanders o'er
In thought a length of lands he trod before,
Sends forth his active mind from place to place,
Joins hill to dale, and measures space with space:
So swift flew Juno to the bless'd abodes,
If thought of man can match the speed of gods.
There sat the powers in awful synod placed;
They bow'd, and made obeisance as she pass'd
Through all the brazen dome: with goblets crown'd(239)
They hail her queen; the nectar streams around.
Fair Themis first presents the golden bowl,
And anxious asks what cares disturb her soul?

To whom the white-arm'd goddess thus replies:
"Enough thou know'st the tyrant of the skies,
Severely bent his purpose to fulfil,
Unmoved his mind, and unrestrain'd his will.
Go thou, the feasts of heaven attend thy call;
Bid the crown'd nectar circle round the hall:
But Jove shall thunder through the ethereal dome
Such stern decrees, such threaten'd woes to come,
As soon shall freeze mankind with dire surprise,
And damp the eternal banquets of the skies."

The goddess said, and sullen took her place;
Black horror sadden'd each celestial face.
To see the gathering grudge in every breast,
Smiles on her lips a spleenful joy express'd;
While on her wrinkled front, and eyebrow bent,
Sat stedfast care, and lowering discontent.
Thus she proceeds--"Attend, ye powers above!
But know, 'tis madness to contest with Jove:
Supreme he sits; and sees, in pride of sway.
Your vassal godheads grudgingly obey:
Fierce in the majesty of power controls;
Shakes all the thrones of heaven, and bends the poles.
Submiss, immortals! all he wills, obey:
And thou, great Mars, begin and show the way.
Behold Ascalaphus! behold him die,
But dare not murmur, dare not vent a sigh;
Thy own loved boasted offspring lies o'erthrown,
If that loved boasted offspring be thy own."

Stern Mars, with anguish for his slaughter'd son,
Smote his rebelling breast, and fierce begun:
"Thus then, immortals! thus shall Mars obey;
Forgive me, gods, and yield my vengeance way:
Descending first to yon forbidden plain,
The god of battles dares avenge the slain;
Dares, though the thunder bursting o'er my head
Should hurl me blazing on those heaps of dead."

With that he gives command to Fear and Flight
To join his rapid coursers for the fight:
Then grim in arms, with hasty vengeance flies;
Arms that reflect a radiance through the skies.
And now had Jove, by bold rebellion driven,
Discharged his wrath on half the host of heaven;
But Pallas, springing through the bright abode,
Starts from her azure throne to calm the god.
Struck for the immortal race with timely fear,
From frantic Mars she snatch'd the shield and spear;
Then the huge helmet lifting from his head,
Thus to the impetuous homicide she said:

"By what wild passion, furious! art thou toss'd?
Striv'st thou with Jove? thou art already lost.
Shall not the Thunderer's dread command restrain,
And was imperial Juno heard in vain?
Back to the skies wouldst thou with shame be driven,
And in thy guilt involve the host of heaven?
Ilion and Greece no more should Jove engage,
The skies would yield an ampler scene of rage;
Guilty and guiltless find an equal fate
And one vast ruin whelm the Olympian state.
Cease then thy offspring's death unjust to call;
Heroes as great have died, and yet shall fall.
Why should heaven's law with foolish man comply
Exempted from the race ordain'd to die?"

This menace fix'd the warrior to his throne;
Sullen he sat, and curb'd the rising groan.
Then Juno call'd (Jove's orders to obey)
The winged Iris, and the god of day.
"Go wait the Thunderer's will (Saturnia cried)
On yon tall summit of the fountful Ide:
There in the father's awful presence stand,
Receive, and execute his dread command."

She said, and sat; the god that gilds the day,
And various Iris, wing their airy way.
Swift as the wind, to Ida's hills they came,
(Fair nurse of fountains, and of savage game)
There sat the eternal; he whose nod controls
The trembling world, and shakes the steady poles.
Veil'd in a mist of fragrance him they found,
With clouds of gold and purple circled round.
Well-pleased the Thunderer saw their earnest care,
And prompt obedience to the queen of air;
Then (while a smile serenes his awful brow)
Commands the goddess of the showery bow:

"Iris! descend, and what we here ordain,
Report to yon mad tyrant of the main.
Bid him from fight to his own deeps repair,
Or breathe from slaughter in the fields of air.
If he refuse, then let him timely weigh
Our elder birthright, and superior sway.
How shall his rashness stand the dire alarms,
If heaven's omnipotence descend in arms?
Strives he with me, by whom his power was given,
And is there equal to the lord of heaven?"

The all-mighty spoke; the goddess wing'd her flight
To sacred Ilion from the Idaean height.
Swift as the rattling hail, or fleecy snows,
Drive through the skies, when Boreas fiercely blows;
So from the clouds descending Iris falls,
And to blue Neptune thus the goddess calls:

"Attend the mandate of the sire above!
In me behold the messenger of Jove:
He bids thee from forbidden wars repair
To thine own deeps, or to the fields of air.
This if refused, he bids thee timely weigh
His elder birthright, and superior sway.
How shall thy rashness stand the dire alarms
If heaven's omnipotence descend in arms?
Striv'st thou with him by whom all power is given?
And art thou equal to the lord of heaven?"

"What means the haughty sovereign of the skies?
(The king of ocean thus, incensed, replies;)
Rule as he will his portion'd realms on high;
No vassal god, nor of his train, am I.
Three brother deities from Saturn came,
And ancient Rhea, earth's immortal dame:
Assign'd by lot, our triple rule we know;
Infernal Pluto sways the shades below;
O'er the wide clouds, and o'er the starry plain,
Ethereal Jove extends his high domain;
My court beneath the hoary waves I keep,
And hush the roarings of the sacred deep;
Olympus, and this earth, in common lie:
What claim has here the tyrant of the sky?
Far in the distant clouds let him control,
And awe the younger brothers of the pole;
There to his children his commands be given,
The trembling, servile, second race of heaven."

"And must I then (said she), O sire of floods!
Bear this fierce answer to the king of gods?
Correct it yet, and change thy rash intent;
A noble mind disdains not to repent.
To elder brothers guardian fiends are given,
To scourge the wretch insulting them and heaven."

"Great is the profit (thus the god rejoin'd)
When ministers are blest with prudent mind:
Warn'd by thy words, to powerful Jove I yield,
And quit, though angry, the contended field:
Not but his threats with justice I disclaim,
The same our honours, and our birth the same.
If yet, forgetful of his promise given
To Hermes, Pallas, and the queen of heaven,
To favour Ilion, that perfidious place,
He breaks his faith with half the ethereal race;
Give him to know, unless the Grecian train
Lay yon proud structures level with the plain,
Howe'er the offence by other gods be pass'd,
The wrath of Neptune shall for ever last."

Thus speaking, furious from the field he strode,
And plunged into the bosom of the flood.
The lord of thunders, from his lofty height
Beheld, and thus bespoke the source of light:

"Behold! the god whose liquid arms are hurl'd
Around the globe, whose earthquakes rock the world,
Desists at length his rebel-war to wage,
Seeks his own seas, and trembles at our rage;
Else had my wrath, heaven's thrones all shaking round,
Burn'd to the bottom of his seas profound;
And all the gods that round old Saturn dwell
Had heard the thunders to the deeps of hell.
Well was the crime, and well the vengeance spared;
Even power immense had found such battle hard.
Go thou, my son! the trembling Greeks alarm,
Shake my broad aegis on thy active arm,
Be godlike Hector thy peculiar care,
Swell his bold heart, and urge his strength to war:
Let Ilion conquer, till the Achaian train
Fly to their ships and Hellespont again:
Then Greece shall breathe from toils." The godhead said;
His will divine the son of Jove obey'd.
Not half so swift the sailing falcon flies,
That drives a turtle through the liquid skies,
As Phoebus, shooting from the Idaean brow,
Glides down the mountain to the plain below.
There Hector seated by the stream he sees,
His sense returning with the coming breeze;
Again his pulses beat, his spirits rise;
Again his loved companions meet his eyes;
Jove thinking of his pains, they pass'd away,
To whom the god who gives the golden day:

"Why sits great Hector from the field so far?
What grief, what wound, withholds thee from the war?"

The fainting hero, as the vision bright
Stood shining o'er him, half unseal'd his sight:

"What blest immortal, with commanding breath,
Thus wakens Hector from the sleep of death?
Has fame not told, how, while my trusty sword
Bathed Greece in slaughter, and her battle gored,
The mighty Ajax with a deadly blow
Had almost sunk me to the shades below?
Even yet, methinks, the gliding ghosts I spy,
And hell's black horrors swim before my eye."

To him Apollo: "Be no more dismay'd;
See, and be strong! the Thunderer sends thee aid.
Behold! thy Phoebus shall his arms employ,
Phoebus, propitious still to thee and Troy.
Inspire thy warriors then with manly force,
And to the ships impel thy rapid horse:
Even I will make thy fiery coursers way,
And drive the Grecians headlong to the sea."

Thus to bold Hector spoke the son of Jove,
And breathed immortal ardour from above.
As when the pamper'd steed, with reins unbound,
Breaks from his stall, and pours along the ground;
With ample strokes he rushes to the flood,
To bathe his sides, and cool his fiery blood;
His head, now freed, he tosses to the skies;
His mane dishevell'd o'er his shoulders flies:
He snuffs the females in the well-known plain,
And springs, exulting, to his fields again:
Urged by the voice divine, thus Hector flew,
Full of the god; and all his hosts pursue.
As when the force of men and dogs combined
Invade the mountain goat, or branching hind;
Far from the hunter's rage secure they lie
Close in the rock, (not fated yet to die)
When lo! a lion shoots across the way!
They fly: at once the chasers and the prey.
So Greece, that late in conquering troops pursued,
And mark'd their progress through the ranks in blood,
Soon as they see the furious chief appear,
Forget to vanquish, and consent to fear.

Thoas with grief observed his dreadful course,
Thoas, the bravest of the Ćtolian force;
Skill'd to direct the javelin's distant flight,
And bold to combat in the standing fight,
Not more in councils famed for solid sense,
Than winning words and heavenly eloquence.
"Gods! what portent (he cried) these eyes invades?
Lo! Hector rises from the Stygian shades!
We saw him, late, by thundering Ajax kill'd:
What god restores him to the frighted field;
And not content that half of Greece lie slain,
Pours new destruction on her sons again?
He comes not, Jove! without thy powerful will;
Lo! still he lives, pursues, and conquers still!
Yet hear my counsel, and his worst withstand:
The Greeks' main body to the fleet command;
But let the few whom brisker spirits warm,
Stand the first onset, and provoke the storm.
Thus point your arms; and when such foes appear,
Fierce as he is, let Hector learn to fear."

The warrior spoke; the listening Greeks obey,
Thickening their ranks, and form a deep array.

Each Ajax, Teucer, Merion gave command,
The valiant leader of the Cretan band;
And Mars-like Meges: these the chiefs excite,
Approach the foe, and meet the coming fight.
Behind, unnumber'd multitudes attend,
To flank the navy, and the shores defend.
Full on the front the pressing Trojans bear,
And Hector first came towering to the war.
Phoebus himself the rushing battle led;
A veil of clouds involved his radiant head:
High held before him, Jove's enormous shield
Portentous shone, and shaded all the field;
Vulcan to Jove the immortal gift consign'd,
To scatter hosts and terrify mankind,
The Greeks expect the shock, the clamours rise
From different parts, and mingle in the skies.
Dire was the hiss of darts, by heroes flung,
And arrows leaping from the bow-string sung;
These drink the life of generous warriors slain:
Those guiltless fall, and thirst for blood in vain.
As long as Phoebus bore unmoved the shield,
Sat doubtful conquest hovering o'er the field;
But when aloft he shakes it in the skies,
Shouts in their ears, and lightens in their eyes,
Deep horror seizes every Grecian breast,
Their force is humbled, and their fear confess'd.
So flies a herd of oxen, scatter'd wide,
No swain to guard them, and no day to guide,
When two fell lions from the mountain come,
And spread the carnage through the shady gloom.
Impending Phoebus pours around them fear,
And Troy and Hector thunder in the rear.
Heaps fall on heaps: the slaughter Hector leads,
First great Arcesilas, then Stichius bleeds;
One to the bold Boeotians ever dear,
And one Menestheus' friend and famed compeer.
Medon and Iasus, Ćneas sped;
This sprang from Phelus, and the Athenians led;
But hapless Medon from Oileus came;
Him Ajax honour'd with a brother's name,
Though born of lawless love: from home expell'd,
A banish'd man, in Phylace he dwell'd,
Press'd by the vengeance of an angry wife;
Troy ends at last his labours and his life.
Mecystes next Polydamas o'erthrew;
And thee, brave Clonius, great Agenor slew.
By Paris, Deiochus inglorious dies,
Pierced through the shoulder as he basely flies.
Polites' arm laid Echius on the plain;
Stretch'd on one heap, the victors spoil the slain.
The Greeks dismay'd, confused, disperse or fall,
Some seek the trench, some skulk behind the wall.
While these fly trembling, others pant for breath,
And o'er the slaughter stalks gigantic death.
On rush'd bold Hector, gloomy as the night;
Forbids to plunder, animates the fight,
Points to the fleet: "For, by the gods! who flies,(240)
Who dares but linger, by this hand he dies;
No weeping sister his cold eye shall close,
No friendly hand his funeral pyre compose.
Who stops to plunder at this signal hour,
The birds shall tear him, and the dogs devour."
Furious he said; the smarting scourge resounds;
The coursers fly; the smoking chariot bounds;
The hosts rush on; loud clamours shake the shore;
The horses thunder, earth and ocean roar!
Apollo, planted at the trench's bound,
Push'd at the bank: down sank the enormous mound:
Roll'd in the ditch the heapy ruin lay;
A sudden road! a long and ample way.
O'er the dread fosse (a late impervious space)
Now steeds, and men, and cars tumultuous pass.
The wondering crowds the downward level trod;
Before them flamed the shield, and march'd the god.
Then with his hand he shook the mighty wall;
And lo! the turrets nod, the bulwarks fall:
Easy as when ashore an infant stands,
And draws imagined houses in the sands;
The sportive wanton, pleased with some new play,
Sweeps the slight works and fashion'd domes away:
Thus vanish'd at thy touch, the towers and walls;
The toil of thousands in a moment falls.

The Grecians gaze around with wild despair,
Confused, and weary all the powers with prayer:
Exhort their men, with praises, threats, commands;
And urge the gods, with voices, eyes, and hands.
Experienced Nestor chief obtests the skies,
And weeps his country with a father's eyes.

"O Jove! if ever, on his native shore,
One Greek enrich'd thy shrine with offer'd gore;
If e'er, in hope our country to behold,
We paid the fattest firstlings of the fold;
If e'er thou sign'st our wishes with thy nod:
Perform the promise of a gracious god!
This day preserve our navies from the flame,
And save the relics of the Grecian name."

Thus prayed the sage: the eternal gave consent,
And peals of thunder shook the firmament.
Presumptuous Troy mistook the accepting sign,
And catch'd new fury at the voice divine.
As, when black tempests mix the seas and skies,
The roaring deeps in watery mountains rise,
Above the sides of some tall ship ascend,
Its womb they deluge, and its ribs they rend:
Thus loudly roaring, and o'erpowering all,
Mount the thick Trojans up the Grecian wall;
Legions on legions from each side arise:
Thick sound the keels; the storm of arrows flies.
Fierce on the ships above, the cars below,
These wield the mace, and those the javelin throw.

While thus the thunder of the battle raged,
And labouring armies round the works engaged,
Still in the tent Patroclus sat to tend
The good Eurypylus, his wounded friend.
He sprinkles healing balms, to anguish kind,
And adds discourse, the medicine of the mind.
But when he saw, ascending up the fleet,
Victorious Troy; then, starting from his seat,
With bitter groans his sorrows he express'd,
He wrings his hands, he beats his manly breast.
"Though yet thy state require redress (he cries)
Depart I must: what horrors strike my eyes!
Charged with Achilles' high command I go,
A mournful witness of this scene of woe;
I haste to urge him by his country's care
To rise in arms, and shine again in war.
Perhaps some favouring god his soul may bend;
The voice is powerful of a faithful friend."

He spoke; and, speaking, swifter than the wind
Sprung from the tent, and left the war behind.
The embodied Greeks the fierce attack sustain,
But strive, though numerous, to repulse in vain:
Nor could the Trojans, through that firm array,
Force to the fleet and tents the impervious way.
As when a shipwright, with Palladian art,
Smooths the rough wood, and levels every part;
With equal hand he guides his whole design,
By the just rule, and the directing line:
The martial leaders, with like skill and care,
Preserved their line, and equal kept the war.
Brave deeds of arms through all the ranks were tried,
And every ship sustained an equal tide.
At one proud bark, high-towering o'er the fleet,
Ajax the great, and godlike Hector meet;
For one bright prize the matchless chiefs contend,
Nor this the ships can fire, nor that defend:
One kept the shore, and one the vessel trod;
That fix'd as fate, this acted by a god.
The son of Clytius in his daring hand,
The deck approaching, shakes a flaming brand;
But, pierced by Telamon's huge lance, expires:
Thundering he falls, and drops the extinguish'd fires.
Great Hector view'd him with a sad survey,
As stretch'd in dust before the stern he lay.
"Oh! all of Trojan, all of Lycian race!
Stand to your arms, maintain this arduous space:
Lo! where the son of royal Clytius lies;
Ah, save his arms, secure his obsequies!"

This said, his eager javelin sought the foe:
But Ajax shunn'd the meditated blow.
Not vainly yet the forceful lance was thrown;
It stretch'd in dust unhappy Lycophron:
An exile long, sustain'd at Ajax' board,
A faithful servant to a foreign lord;
In peace, and war, for ever at his side,
Near his loved master, as he lived, he died.
From the high poop he tumbles on the sand,
And lies a lifeless load along the land.
With anguish Ajax views the piercing sight,
And thus inflames his brother to the fight:

"Teucer, behold! extended on the shore
Our friend, our loved companion! now no more!
Dear as a parent, with a parent's care
To fight our wars he left his native air.
This death deplored, to Hector's rage we owe;
Revenge, revenge it on the cruel foe.
Where are those darts on which the fates attend?
And where the bow which Phoebus taught to bend?"

Impatient Teucer, hastening to his aid,
Before the chief his ample bow display'd;
The well-stored quiver on his shoulders hung:
Then hiss'd his arrow, and the bowstring sung.
Clytus, Pisenor's son, renown'd in fame,
(To thee, Polydamas! an honour'd name)
Drove through the thickest of the embattled plains
The startling steeds, and shook his eager reins.
As all on glory ran his ardent mind,
The pointed death arrests him from behind:
Through his fair neck the thrilling arrow flies;
In youth's first bloom reluctantly he dies.
Hurl'd from the lofty seat, at distance far,
The headlong coursers spurn his empty car;
Till sad Polydamas the steeds restrain'd,
And gave, Astynous, to thy careful hand;
Then, fired to vengeance, rush'd amidst the foe:
Rage edged his sword, and strengthen'd every blow.

Once more bold Teucer, in his country's cause,
At Hector's breast a chosen arrow draws:
And had the weapon found the destined way,
Thy fall, great Trojan! had renown'd that day.
But Hector was not doom'd to perish then:
The all-wise disposer of the fates of men
(Imperial Jove) his present death withstands;
Nor was such glory due to Teucer's hands.
At its full stretch as the tough string he drew,
Struck by an arm unseen, it burst in two;
Down dropp'd the bow: the shaft with brazen head
Fell innocent, and on the dust lay dead.
The astonish'd archer to great Ajax cries;
"Some god prevents our destined enterprise:
Some god, propitious to the Trojan foe,
Has, from my arm unfailing, struck the bow,
And broke the nerve my hands had twined with art,
Strong to impel the flight of many a dart."

"Since heaven commands it (Ajax made reply)
Dismiss the bow, and lay thy arrows by:
Thy arms no less suffice the lance to wield,
And quit the quiver for the ponderous shield.
In the first ranks indulge thy thirst of fame,
Thy brave example shall the rest inflame.
Fierce as they are, by long successes vain;
To force our fleet, or even a ship to gain,
Asks toil, and sweat, and blood: their utmost might
Shall find its match--No more: 'tis ours to fight."

Then Teucer laid his faithless bow aside;
The fourfold buckler o'er his shoulder tied;
On his brave head a crested helm he placed,
With nodding horse-hair formidably graced;
A dart, whose point with brass refulgent shines,
The warrior wields; and his great brother joins.

This Hector saw, and thus express'd his joy:
"Ye troops of Lycia, Dardanus, and Troy!
Be mindful of yourselves, your ancient fame,
And spread your glory with the navy's flame.
Jove is with us; I saw his hand, but now,
From the proud archer strike his vaunted bow:
Indulgent Jove! how plain thy favours shine,
When happy nations bear the marks divine!
How easy then, to see the sinking state
Of realms accursed, deserted, reprobate!
Such is the fate of Greece, and such is ours:
Behold, ye warriors, and exert your powers.
Death is the worst; a fate which all must try;
And for our country, 'tis a bliss to die.
The gallant man, though slain in fight he be,
Yet leaves his nation safe, his children free;
Entails a debt on all the grateful state;
His own brave friends shall glory in his fate;
His wife live honour'd, all his race succeed,
And late posterity enjoy the deed!"

This roused the soul in every Trojan breast:
The godlike Ajax next his Greeks address'd:

"How long, ye warriors of the Argive race,
(To generous Argos what a dire disgrace!)
How long on these cursed confines will ye lie,
Yet undetermined, or to live or die?
What hopes remain, what methods to retire,
If once your vessels catch the Trojan fire?
Make how the flames approach, how near they fall,
How Hector calls, and Troy obeys his call!
Not to the dance that dreadful voice invites,
It calls to death, and all the rage of fights.
'Tis now no time for wisdom or debates;
To your own hands are trusted all your fates;
And better far in one decisive strife,
One day should end our labour or our life,
Than keep this hard-got inch of barren sands,
Still press'd, and press'd by such inglorious hands."

The listening Grecians feel their leader's flame,
And every kindling bosom pants for fame.
Then mutual slaughters spread on either side;
By Hector here the Phocian Schedius died;
There, pierced by Ajax, sunk Laodamas,
Chief of the foot, of old Antenor's race.
Polydamas laid Otus on the sand,
The fierce commander of the Epeian band.
His lance bold Meges at the victor threw;
The victor, stooping, from the death withdrew;
(That valued life, O Phoebus! was thy care)
But Croesmus' bosom took the flying spear:
His corpse fell bleeding on the slippery shore;
His radiant arms triumphant Meges bore.
Dolops, the son of Lampus, rushes on,
Sprung from the race of old Laomedon,
And famed for prowess in a well-fought field,
He pierced the centre of his sounding shield:
But Meges, Phyleus' ample breastplate wore,
(Well-known in fight on Selle's winding shore;
For king Euphetes gave the golden mail,
Compact, and firm with many a jointed scale)
Which oft, in cities storm'd, and battles won,
Had saved the father, and now saves the son.
Full at the Trojan's head he urged his lance,
Where the high plumes above the helmet dance,
New ting'd with Tyrian dye: in dust below,
Shorn from the crest, the purple honours glow.
Meantime their fight the Spartan king survey'd,
And stood by Meges' side a sudden aid.
Through Dolops' shoulder urged his forceful dart,
Which held its passage through the panting heart,
And issued at his breast. With thundering sound
The warrior falls, extended on the ground.
In rush the conquering Greeks to spoil the slain:
But Hector's voice excites his kindred train;
The hero most, from Hicetaon sprung,
Fierce Melanippus, gallant, brave, and young.
He (ere to Troy the Grecians cross'd the main)
Fed his large oxen on Percote's plain;
But when oppress'd, his country claim'd his care,
Return'd to Ilion, and excell'd in war;
For this, in Priam's court, he held his place,
Beloved no less than Priam's royal race.
Him Hector singled, as his troops he led,
And thus inflamed him, pointing to the dead.

"Lo, Melanippus! lo, where Dolops lies;
And is it thus our royal kinsman dies?
O'ermatch'd he falls; to two at once a prey,
And lo! they bear the bloody arms away!
Come on--a distant war no longer wage,
But hand to hand thy country's foes engage:
Till Greece at once, and all her glory end;
Or Ilion from her towery height descend,
Heaved from the lowest stone; and bury all
In one sad sepulchre, one common fall."

Hector (this said) rush'd forward on the foes:
With equal ardour Melanippus glows:
Then Ajax thus--"O Greeks! respect your fame,
Respect yourselves, and learn an honest shame:
Let mutual reverence mutual warmth inspire,
And catch from breast to breast the noble fire,
On valour's side the odds of combat lie;
The brave live glorious, or lamented die;
The wretch that trembles in the field of fame,
Meets death, and worse than death, eternal shame."

His generous sense he not in vain imparts;
It sunk, and rooted in the Grecian hearts:
They join, they throng, they thicken at his call,
And flank the navy with a brazen wall;
Shields touching shields, in order blaze above,
And stop the Trojans, though impell'd by Jove.
The fiery Spartan first, with loud applause.
Warms the bold son of Nestor in his cause.
"Is there (he said) in arms a youth like you,
So strong to fight, so active to pursue?
Why stand you distant, nor attempt a deed?
Lift the bold lance, and make some Trojan bleed."

He said; and backward to the lines retired;
Forth rush'd the youth with martial fury fired,
Beyond the foremost ranks; his lance he threw,
And round the black battalions cast his view.
The troops of Troy recede with sudden fear,
While the swift javelin hiss'd along in air.
Advancing Melanippus met the dart
With his bold breast, and felt it in his heart:
Thundering he falls; his falling arms resound,
And his broad buckler rings against the ground.
The victor leaps upon his prostrate prize:
Thus on a roe the well-breath'd beagle flies,
And rends his side, fresh-bleeding with the dart
The distant hunter sent into his heart.
Observing Hector to the rescue flew;
Bold as he was, Antilochus withdrew.
So when a savage, ranging o'er the plain,
Has torn the shepherd's dog, or shepherd's swain,
While conscious of the deed, he glares around,
And hears the gathering multitude resound,
Timely he flies the yet-untasted food,
And gains the friendly shelter of the wood:
So fears the youth; all Troy with shouts pursue,
While stones and darts in mingled tempest flew;
But enter'd in the Grecian ranks, he turns
His manly breast, and with new fury burns.

Now on the fleet the tides of Trojans drove,
Fierce to fulfil the stern decrees of Jove:
The sire of gods, confirming Thetis' prayer,
The Grecian ardour quench'd in deep despair;
But lifts to glory Troy's prevailing bands,
Swells all their hearts, and strengthens all their hands.
On Ida's top he waits with longing eyes,
To view the navy blazing to the skies;
Then, nor till then, the scale of war shall turn,
The Trojans fly, and conquer'd Ilion burn.
These fates revolved in his almighty mind,
He raises Hector to the work design'd,
Bids him with more than mortal fury glow,
And drives him, like a lightning, on the foe.
So Mars, when human crimes for vengeance call,
Shakes his huge javelin, and whole armies fall.
Not with more rage a conflagration rolls,
Wraps the vast mountains, and involves the poles.
He foams with wrath; beneath his gloomy brow
Like fiery meteors his red eye-balls glow:
The radiant helmet on his temple burns,
Waves when he nods, and lightens as he turns:
For Jove his splendour round the chief had thrown,
And cast the blaze of both the hosts on one.
Unhappy glories! for his fate was near,
Due to stern Pallas, and Pelides' spear:
Yet Jove deferr'd the death he was to pay,
And gave what fate allow'd, the honours of a day!

Now all on fire for fame, his breast, his eyes
Burn at each foe, and single every prize;
Still at the closest ranks, the thickest fight,
He points his ardour, and exerts his might.
The Grecian phalanx, moveless as a tower,
On all sides batter'd, yet resists his power:
So some tall rock o'erhangs the hoary main,(241)
By winds assail'd, by billows beat in vain,
Unmoved it hears, above, the tempest blow,
And sees the watery mountains break below.
Girt in surrounding flames, he seems to fall
Like fire from Jove, and bursts upon them all:
Bursts as a wave that from the cloud impends,
And, swell'd with tempests, on the ship descends;
White are the decks with foam; the winds aloud
Howl o'er the masts, and sing through every shroud:
Pale, trembling, tired, the sailors freeze with fears;
And instant death on every wave appears.
So pale the Greeks the eyes of Hector meet,
The chief so thunders, and so shakes the fleet.

As when a lion, rushing from his den,
Amidst the plain of some wide-water'd fen,
(Where numerous oxen, as at ease they feed,
At large expatiate o'er the ranker mead)
Leaps on the herds before the herdsman's eyes;
The trembling herdsman far to distance flies;
Some lordly bull (the rest dispersed and fled)
He singles out; arrests, and lays him dead.
Thus from the rage of Jove-like Hector flew
All Greece in heaps; but one he seized, and slew:
Mycenian Periphes, a mighty name,
In wisdom great, in arms well known to fame;
The minister of stern Eurystheus' ire
Against Alcides, Copreus was his sire:
The son redeem'd the honours of the race,
A son as generous as the sire was base;
O'er all his country's youth conspicuous far
In every virtue, or of peace or war:
But doom'd to Hector's stronger force to yield!
Against the margin of his ample shield
He struck his hasty foot: his heels up-sprung;
Supine he fell; his brazen helmet rung.
On the fallen chief the invading Trojan press'd,
And plunged the pointed javelin in his breast.
His circling friends, who strove to guard too late
The unhappy hero, fled, or shared his fate.

Chased from the foremost line, the Grecian train
Now man the next, receding toward the main:
Wedged in one body at the tents they stand,
Wall'd round with sterns, a gloomy, desperate band.
Now manly shame forbids the inglorious flight;
Now fear itself confines them to the fight:
Man courage breathes in man; but Nestor most
(The sage preserver of the Grecian host)
Exhorts, adjures, to guard these utmost shores;
And by their parents, by themselves implores.

"Oh friends! be men: your generous breasts inflame
With mutual honour, and with mutual shame!
Think of your hopes, your fortunes; all the care
Your wives, your infants, and your parents share:
Think of each living father's reverend head;
Think of each ancestor with glory dead;
Absent, by me they speak, by me they sue,
They ask their safety, and their fame, from you:
The gods their fates on this one action lay,
And all are lost, if you desert the day."

He spoke, and round him breathed heroic fires;
Minerva seconds what the sage inspires.
The mist of darkness Jove around them threw
She clear'd, restoring all the war to view;
A sudden ray shot beaming o'er the plain,
And show'd the shores, the navy, and the main:
Hector they saw, and all who fly, or fight,
The scene wide-opening to the blaze of light,
First of the field great Ajax strikes their eyes,
His port majestic, and his ample size:
A ponderous mace with studs of iron crown'd,
Full twenty cubits long, he swings around;
Nor fights, like others, fix'd to certain stands
But looks a moving tower above the bands;
High on the decks with vast gigantic stride,
The godlike hero stalks from side to side.
So when a horseman from the watery mead
(Skill'd in the manage of the bounding steed)
Drives four fair coursers, practised to obey,
To some great city through the public way;
Safe in his art, as side by side they run,
He shifts his seat, and vaults from one to one;
And now to this, and now to that he flies;
Admiring numbers follow with their eyes.

From ship to ship thus Ajax swiftly flew,
No less the wonder of the warring crew.
As furious, Hector thunder'd threats aloud,
And rush'd enraged before the Trojan crowd;
Then swift invades the ships, whose beaky prores
Lay rank'd contiguous on the bending shores;
So the strong eagle from his airy height,
Who marks the swans' or cranes' embodied flight,
Stoops down impetuous, while they light for food,
And, stooping, darkens with his wings the flood.
Jove leads him on with his almighty hand,
And breathes fierce spirits in his following band.
The warring nations meet, the battle roars,
Thick beats the combat on the sounding prores.
Thou wouldst have thought, so furious was their fire,
No force could tame them, and no toil could tire;
As if new vigour from new fights they won,
And the long battle was but then begun.
Greece, yet unconquer'd, kept alive the war,
Secure of death, confiding in despair:
Troy in proud hopes already view'd the main
Bright with the blaze, and red with heroes slain:
Like strength is felt from hope, and from despair,
And each contends, as his were all the war.

"Twas thou, bold Hector! whose resistless hand
First seized a ship on that contested strand;
The same which dead Protesilaus bore,(242)
The first that touch'd the unhappy Trojan shore:
For this in arms the warring nations stood,
And bathed their generous breasts with mutual blood.
No room to poise the lance or bend the bow;
But hand to hand, and man to man, they grow:
Wounded, they wound; and seek each other's hearts
With falchions, axes, swords, and shorten'd darts.
The falchions ring, shields rattle, axes sound,
Swords flash in air, or glitter on the ground;
With streaming blood the slippery shores are dyed,
And slaughter'd heroes swell the dreadful tide.

Still raging, Hector with his ample hand
Grasps the high stern, and gives this loud command:

           [Illustration: AJAX DEFENDING THE GREEK SHIPS.]

                   AJAX DEFENDING THE GREEK SHIPS.


"Haste, bring the flames! that toil of ten long years
Is finished; and the day desired appears!
This happy day with acclamations greet,
Bright with destruction of yon hostile fleet.
The coward-counsels of a timorous throng
Of reverend dotards check'd our glory long:
Too long Jove lull'd us with lethargic charms,
But now in peals of thunder calls to arms:
In this great day he crowns our full desires,
Wakes all our force, and seconds all our fires."

He spoke--the warriors at his fierce command
Pour a new deluge on the Grecian band.
Even Ajax paused, (so thick the javelins fly,)
Stepp'd back, and doubted or to live or die.
Yet, where the oars are placed, he stands to wait
What chief approaching dares attempt his fate:
Even to the last his naval charge defends,
Now shakes his spear, now lifts, and now protends;
Even yet, the Greeks with piercing shouts inspires,
Amidst attacks, and deaths, and darts, and fires.

"O friends! O heroes! names for ever dear,
Once sons of Mars, and thunderbolts of war!
Ah! yet be mindful of your old renown,
Your great forefathers' virtues and your own.
What aids expect you in this utmost strait?
What bulwarks rising between you and fate?
No aids, no bulwarks your retreat attend,
No friends to help, no city to defend.
This spot is all you have, to lose or keep;
There stand the Trojans, and here rolls the deep.
'Tis hostile ground you tread; your native lands
Far, far from hence: your fates are in your hands."

Raging he spoke; nor further wastes his breath,
But turns his javelin to the work of death.
Whate'er bold Trojan arm'd his daring hands,
Against the sable ships, with flaming brands,
So well the chief his naval weapon sped,
The luckless warrior at his stern lay dead:
Full twelve, the boldest, in a moment fell,
Sent by great Ajax to the shades of hell.

                  [Illustration: CASTOR AND POLLUX.]

                          CASTOR AND POLLUX.





BOOK XVI.


ARGUMENT

THE SIXTH BATTLE, THE ACTS AND DEATH OF PATROCLUS

Patroclus (in pursuance of the request of Nestor in the eleventh book)
entreats Achilles to suffer him to go to the assistance of the Greeks with
Achilles' troops and armour. He agrees to it, but at the same time charges
him to content himself with rescuing the fleet, without further pursuit of
the enemy. The armour, horses, soldiers, and officers are described.
Achilles offers a libation for the success of his friend, after which
Patroclus leads the Myrmidons to battle. The Trojans, at the sight of
Patroclus in Achilles' armour, taking him for that hero, are cast into the
uttermost consternation; he beats them off from the vessels, Hector
himself flies, Sarpedon is killed, though Jupiter was averse to his fate.
Several other particulars of the battle are described; in the heat of
which, Patroclus, neglecting the orders of Achilles, pursues the foe to
the walls of Troy, where Apollo repulses and disarms him, Euphorbus wounds
him, and Hector kills him, which concludes the book.

So warr'd both armies on the ensanguined shore,
While the black vessels smoked with human gore.
Meantime Patroclus to Achilles flies;
The streaming tears fall copious from his eyes
Not faster, trickling to the plains below,
From the tall rock the sable waters flow.
Divine Pelides, with compassion moved.
Thus spoke, indulgent, to his best beloved:(243)

"Patroclus, say, what grief thy bosom bears,
That flows so fast in these unmanly tears?
No girl, no infant whom the mother keeps
From her loved breast, with fonder passion weeps;
Not more the mother's soul, that infant warms,
Clung to her knees, and reaching at her arms,
Than thou hast mine! Oh tell me, to what end
Thy melting sorrows thus pursue thy friend?

"Griev'st thou for me, or for, my martial band?
Or come sad tidings from our native land?
Our fathers live (our first, most tender care),
Thy good Menoetius breathes the vital air,
And hoary Peleus yet extends his days;
Pleased in their age to hear their children's praise.
Or may some meaner cause thy pity claim?
Perhaps yon relics of the Grecian name,
Doom'd in their ships to sink by fire and sword,
And pay the forfeit of their haughty lord?
Whate'er the cause, reveal thy secret care,
And speak those sorrows which a friend would share."
A sigh that instant from his bosom broke,
Another follow'd, and Patroclus spoke:

"Let Greece at length with pity touch thy breast,
Thyself a Greek; and, once, of Greeks the best!
Lo! every chief that might her fate prevent,
Lies pierced with wounds, and bleeding in his tent:
Eurypylus, Tydides, Atreus' son,
And wise Ulysses, at the navy groan,
More for their country's wounds than for their own.
Their pain soft arts of pharmacy can ease,
Thy breast alone no lenitives appease.
May never rage like thine my soul enslave,
O great in vain! unprofitably brave!
Thy country slighted in her last distress,
What friend, what man, from thee shall hope redress?
No--men unborn, and ages yet behind,
Shall curse that fierce, that unforgiving mind.

"O man unpitying! if of man thy race;
But sure thou spring'st not from a soft embrace,
Nor ever amorous hero caused thy birth,
Nor ever tender goddess brought thee forth:
Some rugged rock's hard entrails gave thee form,
And raging seas produced thee in a storm,
A soul well suiting that tempestuous kind,
So rough thy manners, so untamed thy mind.

"If some dire oracle thy breast alarm,
If aught from Jove, or Thetis, stop thy arm,
Some beam of comfort yet on Greece may shine,
If I but lead the Myrmidonian line:
Clad in thy dreadful arms if I appear,
Proud Troy shall tremble, and desert the war;
Without thy person Greece shall win the day,
And thy mere image chase her foes away.
Press'd by fresh forces, her o'erlabour'd train
Shall quit the ships, and Greece respire again."
Thus, blind to fate! with supplicating breath,
Thou begg'st his arms, and in his arms thy death.
Unfortunately good! a boding sigh
Thy friend return'd; and with it, this reply:
"Patroclus! thy Achilles knows no fears;
Nor words from Jove nor oracles he hears;
Nor aught a mother's caution can suggest;
The tyrant's pride lies rooted in my breast.
My wrongs, my wrongs, my constant thought engage,
Those, my sole oracles, inspire my rage:
I made him tyrant: gave him power to wrong
Even my: I felt it; and shall feel it long.
The maid, my black-eyed maid, he forced away,
Due to the toils of many a well-fought day;
Due to my conquest of her father's reign;
Due to the votes of all the Grecian train.
From me he forced her; me, the bold and brave,
Disgraced, dishonour'd, like the meanest slave.
But bear we this--the wrongs I grieve are past;
'Tis time our fury should relent at last:
I fix'd its date; the day I wish'd appears:
How Hector to my ships his battle bears,
The flames my eyes, the shouts invade my ears.
Go then, Patroclus! court fair honour's charms
In Troy's famed fields, and in Achilles' arms:
Lead forth my martial Myrmidons to fight,
Go save the fleets, and conquer in my right.
See the thin relics of their baffled band
At the last edge of yon deserted land!
Behold all Ilion on their ships descends;
How the cloud blackens, how the storm impends!
It was not thus, when, at my sight amazed,
Troy saw and trembled, as this helmet blazed:
Had not the injurious king our friendship lost,
Yon ample trench had buried half her host.
No camps, no bulwarks now the Trojans fear,
Those are not dreadful, no Achilles there;
No longer flames the lance of Tydeus' son;
No more your general calls his heroes on:
Hector, alone, I hear; his dreadful breath
Commands your slaughter, or proclaims your death.
Yet now, Patroclus, issue to the plain:
Now save the ships, the rising fires restrain,
And give the Greeks to visit Greece again.
But heed my words, and mark a friend's command,
Who trusts his fame and honours in thy hand,
And from thy deeds expects the Achaian host
Shall render back the beauteous maid he lost:
Rage uncontroll'd through all the hostile crew,
But touch not Hector, Hector is my due.
Though Jove in thunder should command the war,
Be just, consult my glory, and forbear.
The fleet once saved, desist from further chase,
Nor lead to Ilion's walls the Grecian race;
Some adverse god thy rashness may destroy;
Some god, like Phoebus, ever kind to Troy.
Let Greece, redeem'd from this destructive strait,
Do her own work; and leave the rest to fate.
O! would to all the immortal powers above,
Apollo, Pallas, and almighty Jove!
That not one Trojan might be left alive,
And not a Greek of all the race survive:
Might only we the vast destruction shun,
And only we destroy the accursed town!"
Such conference held the chiefs; while on the strand
Great Jove with conquest crown'd the Trojan band.
Ajax no more the sounding storm sustain'd,
So thick the darts an iron tempest rain'd:
On his tired arm the weighty buckler hung;
His hollow helm with falling javelins rung;
His breath, in quick short pantings, comes and goes;
And painful sweat from all his members flows.
Spent and o'erpower'd, he barely breathes at most;
Yet scarce an army stirs him from his post;
Dangers on dangers all around him glow,
And toil to toil, and woe succeeds to woe.

Say, Muses, throned above the starry frame,
How first the navy blazed with Trojan flame?

Stern Hector waved his sword, and standing near,
Where furious Ajax plied his ashen spear,
Full on the lance a stroke so justly sped,
That the broad falchion lopp'd its brazen head;
His pointless spear the warrior shakes in vain;
The brazen head falls sounding on the plain.
Great Ajax saw, and own'd the hand divine;
Confessing Jove, and trembling at the sign,
Warn'd he retreats. Then swift from all sides pour
The hissing brands; thick streams the fiery shower;
O'er the high stern the curling volumes rise,
And sheets of rolling smoke involve the skies.

Divine Achilles view'd the rising flames,
And smote his thigh, and thus aloud exclaims:
"Arm, arm, Patroclus! Lo, the blaze aspires!
The glowing ocean reddens with the fires.
Arm, ere our vessels catch the spreading flame;
Arm, ere the Grecians be no more a name;
I haste to bring the troops."--The hero said;
The friend with ardour and with joy obey'd.

He cased his limbs in brass; and first around
His manly legs, with silver buckles bound
The clasping greaves; then to his breast applies
The flaming cuirass of a thousand dyes;
Emblazed with studs of gold his falchion shone
In the rich belt, as in a starry zone:
Achilles' shield his ample shoulders spread,
Achilles' helmet nodded o'er his head:
Adorn'd in all his terrible array,
He flash'd around intolerable day.
Alone untouch'd, Pelides' javelin stands,
Not to be poised but by Pelides' hands:
From Pelion's shady brow the plant entire
Old Chiron rent, and shaped it for his sire;
Whose son's great arm alone the weapon wields,
The death of heroes, and the dread of fields.

                       [Illustration: Buckles.]

                               Buckles.


The brave Automedon (an honour'd name,
The second to his lord in love and fame,
In peace his friend, and partner of the war)
The winged coursers harness'd to the car;
Xanthus and Balius, of immortal breed,
Sprung from the wind, and like the wind in speed.
Whom the wing'd harpy, swift Podarge, bore,
By Zephyr pregnant on the breezy shore:
Swift Pedasus was added to their side,
(Once great Aetion's, now Achilles' pride)
Who, like in strength, in swiftness, and in grace,
A mortal courser match'd the immortal race.

Achilles speeds from tent to tent, and warms
His hardy Myrmidons to blood and arms.
All breathing death, around the chief they stand,
A grim, terrific, formidable band:
Grim as voracious wolves, that seek the springs(244)
When scalding thirst their burning bowels wrings;
When some tall stag, fresh-slaughtered in the wood,
Has drench'd their wide insatiate throats with blood,
To the black fount they rush, a hideous throng,
With paunch distended, and with lolling tongue,
Fire fills their eye, their black jaws belch the gore,
And gorged with slaughter still they thirst for more.
Like furious, rush'd the Myrmidonian crew,
Such their dread strength, and such their deathful view.

High in the midst the great Achilles stands,
Directs their order, and the war commands.
He, loved of Jove, had launch'd for Ilion's shores
Full fifty vessels, mann'd with fifty oars:
Five chosen leaders the fierce bands obey,
Himself supreme in valour, as in sway.

First march'd Menestheus, of celestial birth,
Derived from thee, whose waters wash the earth,
Divine Sperchius! Jove-descended flood!
A mortal mother mixing with a god.
Such was Menestheus, but miscall'd by fame
The son of Borus, that espoused the dame.

Eudorus next; whom Polymele the gay,
Famed in the graceful dance, produced to-day.
Her, sly Cellenius loved: on her would gaze,
As with swift step she form'd the running maze:
To her high chamber from Diana's quire,
The god pursued her, urged, and crown'd his fire.
The son confess'd his father's heavenly race,
And heir'd his mother's swiftness in the chase.
Strong Echecleus, bless'd in all those charms
That pleased a god, succeeded to her arms;
Not conscious of those loves, long hid from fame,
With gifts of price he sought and won the dame;
Her secret offspring to her sire she bare;
Her sire caress'd him with a parent's care.

Pisander follow'd; matchless in his art
To wing the spear, or aim the distant dart;
No hand so sure of all the Emathian line,
Or if a surer, great Patroclus! thine.

The fourth by Phoenix' grave command was graced,
Laerces' valiant offspring led the last.

Soon as Achilles with superior care
Had call'd the chiefs, and order'd all the war,
This stern remembrance to his troops he gave:
"Ye far-famed Myrmidons, ye fierce and brave!
Think with what threats you dared the Trojan throng,
Think what reproach these ears endured so long;
'Stern son of Peleus, (thus ye used to say,
While restless, raging, in your ships you lay)
Oh nursed with gall, unknowing how to yield;
Whose rage defrauds us of so famed a field:
If that dire fury must for ever burn,
What make we here? Return, ye chiefs, return!'
Such were your words--Now, warriors! grieve no more,
Lo there the Trojans; bathe your swords in gore!
This day shall give you all your soul demands,
Glut all your hearts, and weary all your hands!"

                        [Illustration: DIANA.]

                                DIANA.


Thus while he roused the fire in every breast,
Close and more close the listening cohorts press'd;
Ranks wedged in ranks; of arms a steely ring
Still grows, and spreads, and thickens round the king.
As when a circling wall the builder forms,
Of strength defensive against wind and storms,
Compacted stones the thickening work compose,
And round him wide the rising structure grows:
So helm to helm, and crest to crest they throng,
Shield urged on shield, and man drove man along;
Thick, undistinguish'd plumes, together join'd,
Float in one sea, and wave before the wind.

Far o'er the rest in glittering pomp appear,
There bold Automedon, Patroclus here;
Brothers in arms, with equal fury fired;
Two friends, two bodies with one soul inspired.

But mindful of the gods, Achilles went
To the rich coffer in his shady tent;
There lay on heaps his various garments roll'd,
And costly furs, and carpets stiff with gold,
(The presents of the silver-footed dame)
From thence he took a bowl, of antique frame,
Which never man had stained with ruddy wine,
Nor raised in offerings to the power divine,
But Peleus' son; and Peleus' son to none
Had raised in offerings, but to Jove alone.
This tinged with sulphur, sacred first to flame,
He purged; and wash'd it in the running stream.
Then cleansed his hands; and fixing for a space
His eyes on heaven, his feet upon the place
Of sacrifice, the purple draught he pour'd
Forth in the midst; and thus the god implored:

"O thou supreme! high-throned all height above!
O great Pelasgic, Dodonaean Jove!
Who 'midst surrounding frosts, and vapours chill,
Presid'st on bleak Dodona's vocal hill:
(Whose groves the Selli, race austere! surround,
Their feet unwash'd, their slumbers on the ground;
Who hear, from rustling oaks, thy dark decrees;
And catch the fates, low-whispered in the breeze;)
Hear, as of old! Thou gav'st, at Thetis' prayer,
Glory to me, and to the Greeks despair.
Lo, to the dangers of the fighting field
The best, the dearest of my friends, I yield,
Though still determined, to my ships confined;
Patroclus gone, I stay but half behind.
Oh! be his guard thy providential care,
Confirm his heart, and string his arm to war:
Press'd by his single force let Hector see
His fame in arms not owing all to me.
But when the fleets are saved from foes and fire,
Let him with conquest and renown retire;
Preserve his arms, preserve his social train,
And safe return him to these eyes again!"

Great Jove consents to half the chief's request,
But heaven's eternal doom denies the rest;
To free the fleet was granted to his prayer;
His safe return, the winds dispersed in air.
Back to his tent the stern Achilles flies,
And waits the combat with impatient eyes.

Meanwhile the troops beneath Patroclus' care,
Invade the Trojans, and commence the war.
As wasps, provoked by children in their play,
Pour from their mansions by the broad highway,
In swarms the guiltless traveller engage,
Whet all their stings, and call forth all their rage:
All rise in arms, and, with a general cry,
Assert their waxen domes, and buzzing progeny.
Thus from the tents the fervent legion swarms,
So loud their clamours, and so keen their arms:
Their rising rage Patroclus' breath inspires,
Who thus inflames them with heroic fires:

"O warriors, partners of Achilles' praise!
Be mindful of your deeds in ancient days;
Your godlike master let your acts proclaim,
And add new glories to his mighty name.
Think your Achilles sees you fight: be brave,
And humble the proud monarch whom you save."

Joyful they heard, and kindling as he spoke,
Flew to the fleet, involved in fire and smoke.
From shore to shore the doubling shouts resound,
The hollow ships return a deeper sound.
The war stood still, and all around them gazed,
When great Achilles' shining armour blazed:
Troy saw, and thought the dread Achilles nigh,
At once they see, they tremble, and they fly.

Then first thy spear, divine Patroclus! flew,
Where the war raged, and where the tumult grew.
Close to the stern of that famed ship which bore
Unbless'd Protesilaus to Ilion's shore,
The great Paeonian, bold Pyrechmes stood;
(Who led his bands from Axius' winding flood;)
His shoulder-blade receives the fatal wound;
The groaning warrior pants upon the ground.
His troops, that see their country's glory slain,
Fly diverse, scatter'd o'er the distant plain.
Patroclus' arm forbids the spreading fires,
And from the half-burn'd ship proud Troy retires;
Clear'd from the smoke the joyful navy lies;
In heaps on heaps the foe tumultuous flies;
Triumphant Greece her rescued decks ascends,
And loud acclaim the starry region rends.
So when thick clouds enwrap the mountain's head,
O'er heaven's expanse like one black ceiling spread;
Sudden the Thunderer, with a flashing ray,
Bursts through the darkness, and lets down the day:
The hills shine out, the rocks in prospect rise,
And streams, and vales, and forests, strike the eyes;
The smiling scene wide opens to the sight,
And all the unmeasured ether flames with light.

But Troy repulsed, and scatter'd o'er the plains,
Forced from the navy, yet the fight maintains.
Now every Greek some hostile hero slew,
But still the foremost, bold Patroclus flew:
As Areilycus had turn'd him round,
Sharp in his thigh he felt the piercing wound;
The brazen-pointed spear, with vigour thrown,
The thigh transfix'd, and broke the brittle bone:
Headlong he fell. Next, Thoas was thy chance;
Thy breast, unarm'd, received the Spartan lance.
Phylides' dart (as Amphidus drew nigh)
His blow prevented, and transpierced his thigh,
Tore all the brawn, and rent the nerves away;
In darkness, and in death, the warrior lay.

In equal arms two sons of Nestor stand,
And two bold brothers of the Lycian band:
By great Antilochus, Atymnius dies,
Pierced in the flank, lamented youth! he lies,
Kind Maris, bleeding in his brother's wound,
Defends the breathless carcase on the ground;
Furious he flies, his murderer to engage:
But godlike Thrasimed prevents his rage,
Between his arm and shoulder aims a blow;
His arm falls spouting on the dust below:
He sinks, with endless darkness cover'd o'er:
And vents his soul, effused with gushing gore.

Slain by two brothers, thus two brothers bleed,
Sarpedon's friends, Amisodarus' seed;
Amisodarus, who, by Furies led,
The bane of men, abhorr'd Chimaera bred;
Skill'd in the dart in vain, his sons expire,
And pay the forfeit of their guilty sire.

Stopp'd in the tumult Cleobulus lies,
Beneath Oileus' arm, a living prize;
A living prize not long the Trojan stood;
The thirsty falchion drank his reeking blood:
Plunged in his throat the smoking weapon lies;
Black death, and fate unpitying, seal his eyes.

Amid the ranks, with mutual thirst of fame,
Lycon the brave, and fierce Peneleus came;
In vain their javelins at each other flew,
Now, met in arms, their eager swords they drew.
On the plumed crest of his Boeotian foe
The daring Lycon aim'd a noble blow;
The sword broke short; but his, Peneleus sped
Full on the juncture of the neck and head:
The head, divided by a stroke so just,
Hung by the skin; the body sunk to dust.

O'ertaken Neamas by Merion bleeds,
Pierced through the shoulder as he mounts his steeds;
Back from the car he tumbles to the ground:
His swimming eyes eternal shades surround.

Next Erymas was doom'd his fate to feel,
His open'd mouth received the Cretan steel:
Beneath the brain the point a passage tore,
Crash'd the thin bones, and drown'd the teeth in gore:
His mouth, his eyes, his nostrils, pour a flood;
He sobs his soul out in the gush of blood.

As when the flocks neglected by the swain,
Or kids, or lambs, lie scatter'd o'er the plain,
A troop of wolves the unguarded charge survey,
And rend the trembling, unresisting prey:
Thus on the foe the Greeks impetuous came;
Troy fled, unmindful of her former fame.

But still at Hector godlike Ajax aim'd,
Still, pointed at his breast, his javelin flamed.
The Trojan chief, experienced in the field,
O'er his broad shoulders spread the massy shield,
Observed the storm of darts the Grecians pour,
And on his buckler caught the ringing shower:
He sees for Greece the scale of conquest rise,
Yet stops, and turns, and saves his loved allies.

As when the hand of Jove a tempest forms,
And rolls the cloud to blacken heaven with storms,
Dark o'er the fields the ascending vapour flies,
And shades the sun, and blots the golden skies:
So from the ships, along the dusky plain,
Dire Flight and Terror drove the Trojan train.
Even Hector fled; through heads of disarray
The fiery coursers forced their lord away:
While far behind his Trojans fall confused;
Wedged in the trench, in one vast carnage bruised:
Chariots on chariots roll: the clashing spokes
Shock; while the madding steeds break short their yokes.
In vain they labour up the steepy mound;
Their charioteers lie foaming on the ground.
Fierce on the rear, with shouts Patroclus flies;
Tumultuous clamour fills the fields and skies;
Thick drifts of dust involve their rapid flight;
Clouds rise on clouds, and heaven is snatch'd from sight.
The affrighted steeds their dying lords cast down,
Scour o'er the fields, and stretch to reach the town.
Loud o'er the rout was heard the victor's cry,
Where the war bleeds, and where the thickest die,
Where horse and arms, and chariots he o'erthrown,
And bleeding heroes under axles groan.
No stop, no check, the steeds of Peleus knew:
From bank to bank the immortal coursers flew.
High-bounding o'er the fosse, the whirling car
Smokes through the ranks, o'ertakes the flying war,
And thunders after Hector; Hector flies,
Patroclus shakes his lance; but fate denies.
Not with less noise, with less impetuous force,
The tide of Trojans urge their desperate course,
Than when in autumn Jove his fury pours,
And earth is loaden with incessant showers;
(When guilty mortals break the eternal laws,
Or judges, bribed, betray the righteous cause;)
From their deep beds he bids the rivers rise,
And opens all the flood-gates of the skies:
The impetuous torrents from their hills obey,
Whole fields are drown'd, and mountains swept away;
Loud roars the deluge till it meets the main;
And trembling man sees all his labours vain!

And now the chief (the foremost troops repell'd)
Back to the ships his destined progress held,
Bore down half Troy in his resistless way,
And forced the routed ranks to stand the day.
Between the space where silver Simois flows,
Where lay the fleets, and where the rampires rose,
All grim in dust and blood Patroclus stands,
And turns the slaughter on the conquering bands.
First Pronous died beneath his fiery dart,
Which pierced below the shield his valiant heart.
Thestor was next, who saw the chief appear,
And fell the victim of his coward fear;
Shrunk up he sat, with wild and haggard eye,
Nor stood to combat, nor had force to fly;
Patroclus mark'd him as he shunn'd the war,
And with unmanly tremblings shook the car,
And dropp'd the flowing reins. Him 'twixt the jaws,
The javelin sticks, and from the chariot draws.
As on a rock that overhangs the main,
An angler, studious of the line and cane,
Some mighty fish draws panting to the shore:
Not with less ease the barbed javelin bore
The gaping dastard; as the spear was shook,
He fell, and life his heartless breast forsook.

Next on Eryalus he flies; a stone,
Large as a rock, was by his fury thrown:
Full on his crown the ponderous fragment flew,
And burst the helm, and cleft the head in two:
Prone to the ground the breathless warrior fell,
And death involved him with the shades of hell.
Then low in dust Epaltes, Echius, lie;
Ipheas, Evippus, Polymelus, die;
Amphoterus and Erymas succeed;
And last Tlepolemus and Pyres bleed.
Where'er he moves, the growing slaughters spread
In heaps on heaps a monument of dead.

When now Sarpedon his brave friends beheld
Grovelling in dust, and gasping on the field,
With this reproach his flying host he warms:
"Oh stain to honour! oh disgrace to arms!
Forsake, inglorious, the contended plain;
This hand unaided shall the war sustain:
The task be mine this hero's strength to try,
Who mows whole troops, and makes an army fly."

He spake: and, speaking, leaps from off the car:
Patroclus lights, and sternly waits the war.
As when two vultures on the mountain's height
Stoop with resounding pinions to the fight;
They cuff, they tear, they raise a screaming cry;
The desert echoes, and the rocks reply:
The warriors thus opposed in arms, engage
With equal clamours, and with equal rage.

Jove view'd the combat: whose event foreseen,
He thus bespoke his sister and his queen:
"The hour draws on; the destinies ordain,(245)
My godlike son shall press the Phrygian plain:
Already on the verge of death he stands,
His life is owed to fierce Patroclus' hands,
What passions in a parent's breast debate!
Say, shall I snatch him from impending fate,
And send him safe to Lycia, distant far
From all the dangers and the toils of war;
Or to his doom my bravest offspring yield,
And fatten, with celestial blood, the field?"

Then thus the goddess with the radiant eyes:
"What words are these, O sovereign of the skies!
Short is the date prescribed to mortal man;
Shall Jove for one extend the narrow span,
Whose bounds were fix'd before his race began?
How many sons of gods, foredoom'd to death,
Before proud Ilion must resign their breath!
Were thine exempt, debate would rise above,
And murmuring powers condemn their partial Jove.
Give the bold chief a glorious fate in fight;
And when the ascending soul has wing'd her flight,
Let Sleep and Death convey, by thy command,
The breathless body to his native land.
His friends and people, to his future praise,
A marble tomb and pyramid shall raise,
And lasting honours to his ashes give;
His fame ('tis all the dead can have) shall live."

She said: the cloud-compeller, overcome,
Assents to fate, and ratifies the doom.
Then touch'd with grief, the weeping heavens distill'd
A shower of blood o'er all the fatal field:
The god, his eyes averting from the plain,
Laments his son, predestined to be slain,
Far from the Lycian shores, his happy native reign.
Now met in arms, the combatants appear;
Each heaved the shield, and poised the lifted spear;
From strong Patroclus' hand the javelin fled,
And pass'd the groin of valiant Thrasymed;
The nerves unbraced no more his bulk sustain,
He falls, and falling bites the bloody plain.
Two sounding darts the Lycian leader threw:
The first aloof with erring fury flew,
The next transpierced Achilles' mortal steed,
The generous Pedasus of Theban breed:
Fix'd in the shoulder's joint, he reel'd around,
Roll'd in the bloody dust, and paw'd the slippery ground.
His sudden fall the entangled harness broke;
Each axle crackled, and the chariot shook:
When bold Automedon, to disengage
The starting coursers, and restrain their rage,
Divides the traces with his sword, and freed
The encumbered chariot from the dying steed:
The rest move on, obedient to the rein:
The car rolls slowly o'er the dusty plain.

The towering chiefs to fiercer fight advance:
And first Sarpedon whirl'd his weighty lance,
Which o'er the warrior's shoulder took its course,
And spent in empty air its dying force.
Not so Patroclus' never-erring dart;
Aim'd at his breast it pierced a mortal part,
Where the strong fibres bind the solid heart.
Then as the mountain oak, or poplar tall,
Or pine (fit mast for some great admiral)
Nods to the axe, till with a groaning sound
It sinks, and spreads its honours on the ground,
Thus fell the king; and laid on earth supine,
Before his chariot stretch'd his form divine:
He grasp'd the dust distain'd with streaming gore,
And, pale in death, lay groaning on the shore.
So lies a bull beneath the lion's paws,
While the grim savage grinds with foamy jaws
The trembling limbs, and sucks the smoking blood;
Deep groans, and hollow roars, rebellow through the wood.

Then to the leader of the Lycian band
The dying chief address'd his last command;
"Glaucus, be bold; thy task be first to dare
The glorious dangers of destructive war,
To lead my troops, to combat at their head,
Incite the living, and supply the dead.
Tell them, I charged them with my latest breath
Not unrevenged to bear Sarpedon's death.
What grief, what shame, must Glaucus undergo,
If these spoil'd arms adorn a Grecian foe!
Then as a friend, and as a warrior fight;
Defend my body, conquer in my right:
That, taught by great examples, all may try
Like thee to vanquish, or like me to die."
He ceased; the Fates suppress'd his labouring breath,
And his eyes darken'd with the shades of death.
The insulting victor with disdain bestrode
The prostrate prince, and on his bosom trod;
Then drew the weapon from his panting heart,
The reeking fibres clinging to the dart;
From the wide wound gush'd out a stream of blood,
And the soul issued in the purple flood.
His flying steeds the Myrmidons detain,
Unguided now, their mighty master slain.
All-impotent of aid, transfix'd with grief,
Unhappy Glaucus heard the dying chief:
His painful arm, yet useless with the smart
Inflicted late by Teucer's deadly dart,
Supported on his better hand he stay'd:
To Phoebus then ('twas all he could) he pray'd:

"All-seeing monarch! whether Lycia's coast,
Or sacred Ilion, thy bright presence boast,
Powerful alike to ease the wretch's smart;
O hear me! god of every healing art!
Lo! stiff with clotted blood, and pierced with pain,
That thrills my arm, and shoots through every vein,
I stand unable to sustain the spear,
And sigh, at distance from the glorious war.
Low in the dust is great Sarpedon laid,
Nor Jove vouchsafed his hapless offspring aid;
But thou, O god of health! thy succour lend,
To guard the relics of my slaughter'd friend:
For thou, though distant, canst restore my might,
To head my Lycians, and support the fight."

Apollo heard; and, suppliant as he stood,
His heavenly hand restrain'd the flux of blood;
He drew the dolours from the wounded part,
And breathed a spirit in his rising heart.
Renew'd by art divine, the hero stands,
And owns the assistance of immortal hands.
First to the fight his native troops he warms,
Then loudly calls on Troy's vindictive arms;
With ample strides he stalks from place to place;
Now fires Agenor, now Polydamas:
Ćneas next, and Hector he accosts;
Inflaming thus the rage of all their hosts.

"What thoughts, regardless chief! thy breast employ?
Oh too forgetful of the friends of Troy!
Those generous friends, who, from their country far,
Breathe their brave souls out in another's war.
See! where in dust the great Sarpedon lies,
In action valiant, and in council wise,
Who guarded right, and kept his people free;
To all his Lycians lost, and lost to thee!
Stretch'd by Patroclus' arm on yonder plains,
O save from hostile rage his loved remains!
Ah let not Greece his conquer'd trophies boast,
Nor on his corse revenge her heroes lost!"

He spoke: each leader in his grief partook:
Troy, at the loss, through all her legions shook.
Transfix'd with deep regret, they view o'erthrown
At once his country's pillar, and their own;
A chief, who led to Troy's beleaguer'd wall
A host of heroes, and outshined them all.
Fired, they rush on; first Hector seeks the foes,
And with superior vengeance greatly glows.

But o'er the dead the fierce Patroclus stands,
And rousing Ajax, roused the listening bands:

"Heroes, be men; be what you were before;
Or weigh the great occasion, and be more.
The chief who taught our lofty walls to yield,
Lies pale in death, extended on the field.
To guard his body Troy in numbers flies;
Tis half the glory to maintain our prize.
Haste, strip his arms, the slaughter round him spread,
And send the living Lycians to the dead."

The heroes kindle at his fierce command;
The martial squadrons close on either hand:
Here Troy and Lycia charge with loud alarms,
Thessalia there, and Greece, oppose their arms.
With horrid shouts they circle round the slain;
The clash of armour rings o'er all the plain.
Great Jove, to swell the horrors of the fight,
O'er the fierce armies pours pernicious night,
And round his son confounds the warring hosts,
His fate ennobling with a crowd of ghosts.

Now Greece gives way, and great Epigeus falls;
Agacleus' son, from Budium's lofty walls;
Who chased for murder thence a suppliant came
To Peleus, and the silver-footed dame;
Now sent to Troy, Achilles' arms to aid,
He pays due vengeance to his kinsman's shade.
Soon as his luckless hand had touch'd the dead,
A rock's large fragment thunder'd on his head;
Hurl'd by Hectorean force it cleft in twain
His shatter'd helm, and stretch'd him o'er the slain.

Fierce to the van of fight Patroclus came,
And, like an eagle darting at his game,
Sprung on the Trojan and the Lycian band.
What grief thy heart, what fury urged thy hand,
O generous Greek! when with full vigour thrown,
At Sthenelaus flew the weighty stone,
Which sunk him to the dead: when Troy, too near
That arm, drew back; and Hector learn'd to fear.
Far as an able hand a lance can throw,
Or at the lists, or at the fighting foe;
So far the Trojans from their lines retired;
Till Glaucus, turning, all the rest inspired.
Then Bathyclaeus fell beneath his rage,
The only hope of Chalcon's trembling age;
Wide o'er the land was stretch'd his large domain,
With stately seats, and riches blest in vain:
Him, bold with youth, and eager to pursue
The flying Lycians, Glaucus met and slew;
Pierced through the bosom with a sudden wound,
He fell, and falling made the fields resound.
The Achaians sorrow for their heroes slain;
With conquering shouts the Trojans shake the plain,
And crowd to spoil the dead: the Greeks oppose;
An iron circle round the carcase grows.

Then brave Laogonus resign'd his breath,
Despatch'd by Merion to the shades of death:
On Ida's holy hill he made abode,
The priest of Jove, and honour'd like his god.
Between the jaw and ear the javelin went;
The soul, exhaling, issued at the vent.
His spear Aeneas at the victor threw,
Who stooping forward from the death withdrew;
The lance hiss'd harmless o'er his covering shield,
And trembling struck, and rooted in the field;
There yet scarce spent, it quivers on the plain,
Sent by the great Aeneas' arm in vain.
"Swift as thou art (the raging hero cries)
And skill'd in dancing to dispute the prize,
My spear, the destined passage had it found,
Had fix'd thy active vigour to the ground."

"O valiant leader of the Dardan host!
(Insulted Merion thus retorts the boast)
Strong as you are, 'tis mortal force you trust,
An arm as strong may stretch thee in the dust.
And if to this my lance thy fate be given,
Vain are thy vaunts; success is still from heaven:
This, instant, sends thee down to Pluto's coast;
Mine is the glory, his thy parting ghost."

"O friend (Menoetius' son this answer gave)
With words to combat, ill befits the brave;
Not empty boasts the sons of Troy repel,
Your swords must plunge them to the shades of hell.
To speak, beseems the council; but to dare
In glorious action, is the task of war."

This said, Patroclus to the battle flies;
Great Merion follows, and new shouts arise:
Shields, helmets rattle, as the warriors close;
And thick and heavy sounds the storm of blows.
As through the shrilling vale, or mountain ground,
The labours of the woodman's axe resound;
Blows following blows are heard re-echoing wide,
While crackling forests fall on every side:
Thus echoed all the fields with loud alarms,
So fell the warriors, and so rung their arms.

Now great Sarpedon on the sandy shore,
His heavenly form defaced with dust and gore,
And stuck with darts by warring heroes shed,
Lies undistinguish'd from the vulgar dead.
His long-disputed corse the chiefs enclose,
On every side the busy combat grows;
Thick as beneath some shepherd's thatch'd abode
(The pails high foaming with a milky flood)
The buzzing flies, a persevering train,
Incessant swarm, and chased return again.

Jove view'd the combat with a stern survey,
And eyes that flash'd intolerable day.
Fix'd on the field his sight, his breast debates
The vengeance due, and meditates the fates:
Whether to urge their prompt effect, and call
The force of Hector to Patroclus' fall,
This instant see his short-lived trophies won,
And stretch him breathless on his slaughter'd son;
Or yet, with many a soul's untimely flight,
Augment the fame and horror of the fight.
To crown Achilles' valiant friend with praise
At length he dooms; and, that his last of days
Shall set in glory, bids him drive the foe;
Nor unattended see the shades below.
Then Hector's mind he fills with dire dismay;
He mounts his car, and calls his hosts away;
Sunk with Troy's heavy fates, he sees decline
The scales of Jove, and pants with awe divine.

Then, nor before, the hardy Lycians fled,
And left their monarch with the common dead:
Around, in heaps on heaps, a dreadful wall
Of carnage rises, as the heroes fall.
(So Jove decreed!) At length the Greeks obtain
The prize contested, and despoil the slain.
The radiant arms are by Patroclus borne;
Patroclus' ships the glorious spoils adorn.

Then thus to Phoebus, in the realms above,
Spoke from his throne the cloud-compelling Jove:
"Descend, my Phoebus! on the Phrygian plain,
And from the fight convey Sarpedon slain;
Then bathe his body in the crystal flood,
With dust dishonour'd, and deform'd with blood;
O'er all his limbs ambrosial odours shed,
And with celestial robes adorn the dead.
Those rites discharged, his sacred corse bequeath
To the soft arms of silent Sleep and Death.
They to his friends the immortal charge shall bear;
His friends a tomb and pyramid shall rear:
What honour mortals after death receive,
Those unavailing honours we may give!"

[Illustration: SLEEP AND DEATH CONVEYING THE BODY OF SARPEDON TO LYCIA.]

       SLEEP AND DEATH CONVEYING THE BODY OF SARPEDON TO LYCIA.


Apollo bows, and from mount Ida's height,
Swift to the field precipitates his flight;
Thence from the war the breathless hero bore,
Veil'd in a cloud, to silver Simois' shore;
There bathed his honourable wounds, and dress'd
His manly members in the immortal vest;
And with perfumes of sweet ambrosial dews
Restores his freshness, and his form renews.
Then Sleep and Death, two twins of winged race,
Of matchless swiftness, but of silent pace,
Received Sarpedon, at the god's command,
And in a moment reach'd the Lycian land;
The corse amidst his weeping friends they laid,
Where endless honours wait the sacred shade.

Meanwhile Patroclus pours along the plains,
With foaming coursers, and with loosen'd reins.
Fierce on the Trojan and the Lycian crew,
Ah blind to fate! thy headlong fury flew
Against what fate and powerful Jove ordain,
Vain was thy friend's command, thy courage vain.
For he, the god, whose counsels uncontroll'd
Dismay the mighty, and confound the bold;
The god who gives, resumes, and orders all,
He urged thee on, and urged thee on to fall.

Who first, brave hero! by that arm was slain,
Who last beneath thy vengeance press'd the plain;
When heaven itself thy fatal fury led,
And call'd to fill the number of the dead?
Adrestus first; Autonous then succeeds;
Echeclus follows; next young Megas bleeds,
Epistor, Melanippus, bite the ground;
The slaughter, Elasus and Mulius crown'd:
Then sunk Pylartes to eternal night;
The rest, dispersing, trust their fates to flight.

Now Troy had stoop'd beneath his matchless power,
But flaming Phoebus kept the sacred tower
Thrice at the battlements Patroclus strook;(246)
His blazing aegis thrice Apollo shook;
He tried the fourth; when, bursting from the cloud,
A more than mortal voice was heard aloud.

"Patroclus! cease; this heaven-defended wall
Defies thy lance; not fated yet to fall;
Thy friend, thy greater far, it shall withstand,
Troy shall not stoop even to Achilles' hand."

So spoke the god who darts celestial fires;
The Greek obeys him, and with awe retires.
While Hector, checking at the Scaean gates
His panting coursers, in his breast debates,
Or in the field his forces to employ,
Or draw the troops within the walls of Troy.
Thus while he thought, beside him Phoebus stood,
In Asius' shape, who reigned by Sangar's flood;
(Thy brother, Hecuba! from Dymas sprung,
A valiant warrior, haughty, bold, and young;)
Thus he accosts him. "What a shameful sight!
God! is it Hector that forbears the fight?
Were thine my vigour this successful spear
Should soon convince thee of so false a fear.
Turn thee, ah turn thee to the field of fame,
And in Patroclus' blood efface thy shame.
Perhaps Apollo shall thy arms succeed,
And heaven ordains him by thy lance to bleed."

So spoke the inspiring god; then took his flight,
And plunged amidst the tumult of the fight.
He bids Cebrion drive the rapid car;
The lash resounds, the coursers rush to war.
The god the Grecians' sinking souls depress'd,
And pour'd swift spirits through each Trojan breast.
Patroclus lights, impatient for the fight;
A spear his left, a stone employs his right:
With all his nerves he drives it at the foe.
Pointed above, and rough and gross below:
The falling ruin crush'd Cebrion's head,
The lawless offspring of king Priam's bed;
His front, brows, eyes, one undistinguish'd wound:
The bursting balls drop sightless to the ground.
The charioteer, while yet he held the rein,
Struck from the car, falls headlong on the plain.
To the dark shades the soul unwilling glides,
While the proud victor thus his fall derides.

"Good heaven! what active feats yon artist shows!
What skilful divers are our Phrygian foes!
Mark with what ease they sink into the sand!
Pity that all their practice is by land!"

Then rushing sudden on his prostrate prize,
To spoil the carcase fierce Patroclus flies:
Swift as a lion, terrible and bold,
That sweeps the field, depopulates the fold;
Pierced through the dauntless heart, then tumbles slain,
And from his fatal courage finds his bane.
At once bold Hector leaping from his car,
Defends the body, and provokes the war.
Thus for some slaughter'd hind, with equal rage,
Two lordly rulers of the wood engage;
Stung with fierce hunger, each the prey invades,
And echoing roars rebellow through the shades.
Stern Hector fastens on the warrior's head,
And by the foot Patroclus drags the dead:
While all around, confusion, rage, and fright,
Mix the contending hosts in mortal fight.
So pent by hills, the wild winds roar aloud
In the deep bosom of some gloomy wood;
Leaves, arms, and trees, aloft in air are blown,
The broad oaks crackle, and the Sylvans groan;
This way and that, the rattling thicket bends,
And the whole forest in one crash descends.
Not with less noise, with less tumultuous rage,
In dreadful shock the mingled hosts engage.
Darts shower'd on darts, now round the carcase ring;
Now flights of arrows bounding from the string:
Stones follow stones; some clatter on the fields,
Some hard, and heavy, shake the sounding shields.
But where the rising whirlwind clouds the plains,
Sunk in soft dust the mighty chief remains,
And, stretch'd in death, forgets the guiding reins!

Now flaming from the zenith, Sol had driven
His fervid orb through half the vault of heaven;
While on each host with equal tempests fell
The showering darts, and numbers sank to hell.
But when his evening wheels o'erhung the main,
Glad conquest rested on the Grecian train.
Then from amidst the tumult and alarms,
They draw the conquer'd corse and radiant arms.
Then rash Patroclus with new fury glows,
And breathing slaughter, pours amid the foes.
Thrice on the press like Mars himself he flew,
And thrice three heroes at each onset slew.
There ends thy glory! there the Fates untwine
The last, black remnant of so bright a line:
Apollo dreadful stops thy middle way;
Death calls, and heaven allows no longer day!

For lo! the god in dusky clouds enshrined,
Approaching dealt a staggering blow behind.
The weighty shock his neck and shoulders feel;
His eyes flash sparkles, his stunn'd senses reel
In giddy darkness; far to distance flung,
His bounding helmet on the champaign rung.
Achilles' plume is stain'd with dust and gore;
That plume which never stoop'd to earth before;
Long used, untouch'd, in fighting fields to shine,
And shade the temples of the mad divine.
Jove dooms it now on Hector's helm to nod;
Not long--for fate pursues him, and the god.

His spear in shivers falls; his ample shield
Drops from his arm: his baldric strows the field:
The corslet his astonish'd breast forsakes:
Loose is each joint; each nerve with horror shakes;
Stupid he stares, and all-assistless stands:
Such is the force of more than mortal hands!

A Dardan youth there was, well known to fame,
From Panthus sprung, Euphorbus was his name;
Famed for the manage of the foaming horse,
Skill'd in the dart, and matchless in the course:
Full twenty knights he tumbled from the car,
While yet he learn'd his rudiments of war.
His venturous spear first drew the hero's gore;
He struck, he wounded, but he durst no more.
Nor, though disarm'd, Patroclus' fury stood:
But swift withdrew the long-protended wood.
And turn'd him short, and herded in the crowd.
Thus, by an arm divine, and mortal spear,
Wounded, at once, Patroclus yields to fear,
Retires for succour to his social train,
And flies the fate, which heaven decreed, in vain.
Stern Hector, as the bleeding chief he views,
Breaks through the ranks, and his retreat pursues:
The lance arrests him with a mortal wound;
He falls, earth thunders, and his arms resound.
With him all Greece was sunk; that moment all
Her yet-surviving heroes seem'd to fall.
So, scorch'd with heat, along the desert score,
The roaming lion meets a bristly boar,
Fast by the spring; they both dispute the flood,
With flaming eyes, and jaws besmear'd with blood;
At length the sovereign savage wins the strife;
And the torn boar resigns his thirst and life.
Patroclus thus, so many chiefs o'erthrown,
So many lives effused, expires his own.
As dying now at Hector's feet he lies,
He sternly views him, and triumphant cries:

"Lie there, Patroclus! and with thee, the joy
Thy pride once promised, of subverting Troy;
The fancied scenes of Ilion wrapt in flames,
And thy soft pleasures served with captive dames.
Unthinking man! I fought those towers to free,
And guard that beauteous race from lords like thee:
But thou a prey to vultures shalt be made;
Thy own Achilles cannot lend thee aid;
Though much at parting that great chief might say,
And much enjoin thee, this important day.

'Return not, my brave friend (perhaps he said),
Without the bloody arms of Hector dead.'
He spoke, Patroclus march'd, and thus he sped."

Supine, and wildly gazing on the skies,
With faint, expiring breath, the chief replies:

"Vain boaster! cease, and know the powers divine!
Jove's and Apollo's is this deed, not thine;
To heaven is owed whate'er your own you call,
And heaven itself disarm'd me ere my fall.
Had twenty mortals, each thy match in might,
Opposed me fairly, they had sunk in fight:
By fate and Phoebus was I first o'erthrown,
Euphorbus next; the third mean part thy own.
But thou, imperious! hear my latest breath;
The gods inspire it, and it sounds thy death:
Insulting man, thou shalt be soon as I;
Black fate o'erhangs thee, and thy hour draws nigh;
Even now on life's last verge I see thee stand,
I see thee fall, and by Achilles' hand."

He faints: the soul unwilling wings her way,
(The beauteous body left a load of clay)
Flits to the lone, uncomfortable coast;
A naked, wandering, melancholy ghost!

Then Hector pausing, as his eyes he fed
On the pale carcase, thus address'd the dead:

"From whence this boding speech, the stern decree
Of death denounced, or why denounced to me?
Why not as well Achilles' fate be given
To Hector's lance? Who knows the will of heaven?"

Pensive he said; then pressing as he lay
His breathless bosom, tore the lance away;
And upwards cast the corse: the reeking spear
He shakes, and charges the bold charioteer.
But swift Automedon with loosen'd reins
Rapt in the chariot o'er the distant plains,
Far from his rage the immortal coursers drove;
The immortal coursers were the gift of Jove.

BOOK XVII.


ARGUMENT.

THE SEVENTH BATTLE, FOR THE BODY OF PATROCLUS.--THE ACTS OF MENELAUS.

Menelaus, upon the death of Patroclus, defends his body from the enemy:
Euphorbus, who attempts it, is slain. Hector advancing, Menelaus retires;
but soon returns with Ajax, and drives him off. This, Glaucus objects to
Hector as a flight, who thereupon puts on the armour he had won from
Patroclus, and renews the battle. The Greeks give way, till Ajax rallies
them: Aeneas sustains the Trojans. Aeneas and Hector Attempt the chariot
of Achilles, which is borne off by Automedon. The horses of Achilles
deplore the loss of Patroclus: Jupiter covers his body with a thick
darkness: the noble prayer of Ajax on that occasion. Menelaus sends
Antilochus to Achilles, with the news of Patroclus' death: then returns to
the fight, where, though attacked with the utmost fury, he and Meriones,
assisted by the Ajaces, bear off the body to the ships.

The time is the evening of the eight-and-twentieth day. The scene lies in
the fields before Troy.

On the cold earth divine Patroclus spread,
Lies pierced with wounds among the vulgar dead.
Great Menelaus, touch'd with generous woe,
Springs to the front, and guards him from the foe.
Thus round her new-fallen young the heifer moves,
Fruit of her throes, and first-born of her loves;
And anxious (helpless as he lies, and bare)
Turns, and re-turns her, with a mother's care,
Opposed to each that near the carcase came,
His broad shield glimmers, and his lances flame.

The son of Panthus, skill'd the dart to send,
Eyes the dead hero, and insults the friend.
"This hand, Atrides, laid Patroclus low;
Warrior! desist, nor tempt an equal blow:
To me the spoils my prowess won, resign:
Depart with life, and leave the glory mine"

The Trojan thus: the Spartan monarch burn'd
With generous anguish, and in scorn return'd:
"Laugh'st thou not, Jove! from thy superior throne,
When mortals boast of prowess not their own?
Not thus the lion glories in his might,
Nor panther braves his spotted foe in fight,
Nor thus the boar (those terrors of the plain;)
Man only vaunts his force, and vaunts in vain.
But far the vainest of the boastful kind,
These sons of Panthus vent their haughty mind.
Yet 'twas but late, beneath my conquering steel
This boaster's brother, Hyperenor, fell;
Against our arm which rashly he defied,
Vain was his vigour, and as vain his pride.
These eyes beheld him on the dust expire,
No more to cheer his spouse, or glad his sire.
Presumptuous youth! like his shall be thy doom,
Go, wait thy brother to the Stygian gloom;
Or, while thou may'st, avoid the threaten'd fate;
Fools stay to feel it, and are wise too late."

Unmoved, Euphorbus thus: "That action known,
Come, for my brother's blood repay thy own.
His weeping father claims thy destined head,
And spouse, a widow in her bridal bed.
On these thy conquer'd spoils I shall bestow,
To soothe a consort's and a parent's woe.
No longer then defer the glorious strife,
Let heaven decide our fortune, fame, and life."

Swift as the word the missile lance he flings;
The well-aim'd weapon on the buckler rings,
But blunted by the brass, innoxious falls.
On Jove the father great Atrides calls,
Nor flies the javelin from his arm in vain,
It pierced his throat, and bent him to the plain;
Wide through the neck appears the grisly wound,
Prone sinks the warrior, and his arms resound.
The shining circlets of his golden hair,
Which even the Graces might be proud to wear,
Instarr'd with gems and gold, bestrow the shore,
With dust dishonour'd, and deform'd with gore.

As the young olive, in some sylvan scene,
Crown'd by fresh fountains with eternal green,
Lifts the gay head, in snowy flowerets fair,
And plays and dances to the gentle air;
When lo! a whirlwind from high heaven invades
The tender plant, and withers all its shades;
It lies uprooted from its genial bed,
A lovely ruin now defaced and dead:
Thus young, thus beautiful, Euphorbus lay,
While the fierce Spartan tore his arms away.
Proud of his deed, and glorious in the prize,
Affrighted Troy the towering victor flies:
Flies, as before some mountain lion's ire
The village curs and trembling swains retire,
When o'er the slaughter'd bull they hear him roar,
And see his jaws distil with smoking gore:
All pale with fear, at distance scatter'd round,
They shout incessant, and the vales resound.

Meanwhile Apollo view'd with envious eyes,
And urged great Hector to dispute the prize;
(In Mentes' shape, beneath whose martial care
The rough Ciconians learn'd the trade of war;)(247)
"Forbear (he cried) with fruitless speed to chase
Achilles' coursers, of ethereal race;
They stoop not, these, to mortal man's command,
Or stoop to none but great Achilles' hand.
Too long amused with a pursuit so vain,
Turn, and behold the brave Euphorbus slain;
By Sparta slain! for ever now suppress'd
The fire which burn'd in that undaunted breast!"

Thus having spoke, Apollo wing'd his flight,
And mix'd with mortals in the toils of fight:
His words infix'd unutterable care
Deep in great Hector's soul: through all the war
He darts his anxious eye; and, instant, view'd
The breathless hero in his blood imbued,
(Forth welling from the wound, as prone he lay)
And in the victor's hands the shining prey.
Sheath'd in bright arms, through cleaving ranks he flies,
And sends his voice in thunder to the skies:
Fierce as a flood of flame by Vulcan sent,
It flew, and fired the nations as it went.
Atrides from the voice the storm divined,
And thus explored his own unconquer'd mind:

"Then shall I quit Patroclus on the plain,
Slain in my cause, and for my honour slain!
Desert the arms, the relics, of my friend?
Or singly, Hector and his troops attend?
Sure where such partial favour heaven bestow'd,
To brave the hero were to brave the god:
Forgive me, Greece, if once I quit the field;
'Tis not to Hector, but to heaven I yield.
Yet, nor the god, nor heaven, should give me fear,
Did but the voice of Ajax reach my ear:
Still would we turn, still battle on the plains,
And give Achilles all that yet remains
Of his and our Patroclus--" This, no more
The time allow'd: Troy thicken'd on the shore.
A sable scene! The terrors Hector led.
Slow he recedes, and sighing quits the dead.

So from the fold the unwilling lion parts,
Forced by loud clamours, and a storm of darts;
He flies indeed, but threatens as he flies,
With heart indignant and retorted eyes.
Now enter'd in the Spartan ranks, he turn'd
His manly breast, and with new fury burn'd;
O'er all the black battalions sent his view,
And through the cloud the godlike Ajax knew;
Where labouring on the left the warrior stood,
All grim in arms, and cover'd o'er with blood;
There breathing courage, where the god of day
Had sunk each heart with terror and dismay.

To him the king: "Oh Ajax, oh my friend!
Haste, and Patroclus' loved remains defend:
The body to Achilles to restore
Demands our care; alas, we can no more!
For naked now, despoiled of arms, he lies;
And Hector glories in the dazzling prize."
He said, and touch'd his heart. The raging pair
Pierced the thick battle, and provoke the war.
Already had stern Hector seized his head,
And doom'd to Trojan gods the unhappy dead;
But soon as Ajax rear'd his tower-like shield,
Sprung to his car, and measured back the field,
His train to Troy the radiant armour bear,
To stand a trophy of his fame in war.

Meanwhile great Ajax (his broad shield display'd)
Guards the dead hero with the dreadful shade;
And now before, and now behind he stood:
Thus in the centre of some gloomy wood,
With many a step, the lioness surrounds
Her tawny young, beset by men and hounds;
Elate her heart, and rousing all her powers,
Dark o'er the fiery balls each hanging eyebrow lours.
Fast by his side the generous Spartan glows
With great revenge, and feeds his inward woes.

But Glaucus, leader of the Lycian aids,
On Hector frowning, thus his flight upbraids:

"Where now in Hector shall we Hector find?
A manly form, without a manly mind.
Is this, O chief! a hero's boasted fame?
How vain, without the merit, is the name!
Since battle is renounced, thy thoughts employ
What other methods may preserve thy Troy:
'Tis time to try if Ilion's state can stand
By thee alone, nor ask a foreign hand:
Mean, empty boast! but shall the Lycians stake
Their lives for you? those Lycians you forsake?
What from thy thankless arms can we expect?
Thy friend Sarpedon proves thy base neglect;
Say, shall our slaughter'd bodies guard your walls,
While unreveng'd the great Sarpedon falls?
Even where he died for Troy, you left him there,
A feast for dogs, and all the fowls of air.
On my command if any Lycian wait,
Hence let him march, and give up Troy to fate.
Did such a spirit as the gods impart
Impel one Trojan hand or Trojan heart,
(Such as should burn in every soul that draws
The sword for glory, and his country's cause)
Even yet our mutual arms we might employ,
And drag yon carcase to the walls of Troy.
Oh! were Patroclus ours, we might obtain
Sarpedon's arms and honour'd corse again!
Greece with Achilles' friend should be repaid,
And thus due honours purchased to his shade.
But words are vain--Let Ajax once appear,
And Hector trembles and recedes with fear;
Thou dar'st not meet the terrors of his eye;
And lo! already thou prepar'st to fly."

The Trojan chief with fix'd resentment eyed
The Lycian leader, and sedate replied:

"Say, is it just, my friend, that Hector's ear
From such a warrior such a speech should hear?
I deem'd thee once the wisest of thy kind,
But ill this insult suits a prudent mind.
I shun great Ajax? I desert my train?
'Tis mine to prove the rash assertion vain;
I joy to mingle where the battle bleeds,
And hear the thunder of the sounding steeds.
But Jove's high will is ever uncontroll'd,
The strong he withers, and confounds the bold;
Now crowns with fame the mighty man, and now
Strikes the fresh garland from the victor's brow!
Come, through yon squadrons let us hew the way,
And thou be witness, if I fear to-day;
If yet a Greek the sight of Hector dread,
Or yet their hero dare defend the dead."

Then turning to the martial hosts, he cries:
"Ye Trojans, Dardans, Lycians, and allies!
Be men, my friends, in action as in name,
And yet be mindful of your ancient fame.
Hector in proud Achilles' arms shall shine,
Torn from his friend, by right of conquest mine."

He strode along the field, as thus he said:
(The sable plumage nodded o'er his head:)
Swift through the spacious plain he sent a look;
One instant saw, one instant overtook
The distant band, that on the sandy shore
The radiant spoils to sacred Ilion bore.
There his own mail unbraced the field bestrow'd;
His train to Troy convey'd the massy load.
Now blazing in the immortal arms he stands;
The work and present of celestial hands;
By aged Peleus to Achilles given,
As first to Peleus by the court of heaven:
His father's arms not long Achilles wears,
Forbid by fate to reach his father's years.

Him, proud in triumph, glittering from afar,
The god whose thunder rends the troubled air
Beheld with pity; as apart he sat,
And, conscious, look'd through all the scene of fate.
He shook the sacred honours of his head;
Olympus trembled, and the godhead said;
"Ah, wretched man! unmindful of thy end!
A moment's glory; and what fates attend!
In heavenly panoply divinely bright
Thou stand'st, and armies tremble at thy sight,
As at Achilles' self! beneath thy dart
Lies slain the great Achilles' dearer part.
Thou from the mighty dead those arms hast torn,
Which once the greatest of mankind had worn.
Yet live! I give thee one illustrious day,
A blaze of glory ere thou fad'st away.
For ah! no more Andromache shall come
With joyful tears to welcome Hector home;
No more officious, with endearing charms,
From thy tired limbs unbrace Pelides' arms!"

Then with his sable brow he gave the nod
That seals his word; the sanction of the god.
The stubborn arms (by Jove's command disposed)
Conform'd spontaneous, and around him closed:
Fill'd with the god, enlarged his members grew,
Through all his veins a sudden vigour flew,
The blood in brisker tides began to roll,
And Mars himself came rushing on his soul.
Exhorting loud through all the field he strode,
And look'd, and moved, Achilles, or a god.
Now Mesthles, Glaucus, Medon, he inspires,
Now Phorcys, Chromius, and Hippothous fires;
The great Thersilochus like fury found,
Asteropaeus kindled at the sound,
And Ennomus, in augury renown'd.

"Hear, all ye hosts, and hear, unnumber'd bands
Of neighbouring nations, or of distant lands!
'Twas not for state we summon'd you so far,
To boast our numbers, and the pomp of war:
Ye came to fight; a valiant foe to chase,
To save our present, and our future race.
Tor this, our wealth, our products, you enjoy,
And glean the relics of exhausted Troy.
Now then, to conquer or to die prepare;
To die or conquer are the terms of war.
Whatever hand shall win Patroclus slain,
Whoe'er shall drag him to the Trojan train,
With Hector's self shall equal honours claim;
With Hector part the spoil, and share the fame."

Fired by his words, the troops dismiss their fears,
They join, they thicken, they protend their spears;
Full on the Greeks they drive in firm array,
And each from Ajax hopes the glorious prey:
Vain hope! what numbers shall the field o'erspread,
What victims perish round the mighty dead!

Great Ajax mark'd the growing storm from far,
And thus bespoke his brother of the war:
"Our fatal day, alas! is come, my friend;
And all our wars and glories at an end!
'Tis not this corse alone we guard in vain,
Condemn'd to vultures on the Trojan plain;
We too must yield: the same sad fate must fall
On thee, on me, perhaps, my friend, on all.
See what a tempest direful Hector spreads,
And lo! it bursts, it thunders on our heads!
Call on our Greeks, if any hear the call,
The bravest Greeks: this hour demands them all."

The warrior raised his voice, and wide around
The field re-echoed the distressful sound.
"O chiefs! O princes, to whose hand is given
The rule of men; whose glory is from heaven!
Whom with due honours both Atrides grace:
Ye guides and guardians of our Argive race!
All, whom this well-known voice shall reach from far,
All, whom I see not through this cloud of war;
Come all! let generous rage your arms employ,
And save Patroclus from the dogs of Troy."

Oilean Ajax first the voice obey'd,
Swift was his pace, and ready was his aid:
Next him Idomeneus, more slow with age,
And Merion, burning with a hero's rage.
The long-succeeding numbers who can name?
But all were Greeks, and eager all for fame.
Fierce to the charge great Hector led the throng;
Whole Troy embodied rush'd with shouts along.
Thus, when a mountain billow foams and raves,
Where some swoln river disembogues his waves,
Full in the mouth is stopp'd the rushing tide,
The boiling ocean works from side to side,
The river trembles to his utmost shore,
And distant rocks re-bellow to the roar.

Nor less resolved, the firm Achaian band
With brazen shields in horrid circle stand.
Jove, pouring darkness o'er the mingled fight,
Conceals the warriors' shining helms in night:
To him, the chief for whom the hosts contend
Had lived not hateful, for he lived a friend:
Dead he protects him with superior care.
Nor dooms his carcase to the birds of air.

           [Illustration: FIGHT FOR THE BODY OF PATROCLUS.]

                   FIGHT FOR THE BODY OF PATROCLUS.


The first attack the Grecians scarce sustain,
Repulsed, they yield; the Trojans seize the slain.
Then fierce they rally, to revenge led on
By the swift rage of Ajax Telamon.
(Ajax to Peleus' son the second name,
In graceful stature next, and next in fame)
With headlong force the foremost ranks he tore;
So through the thicket bursts the mountain boar,
And rudely scatters, for a distance round,
The frighted hunter and the baying hound.
The son of Lethus, brave Pelasgus' heir,
Hippothous, dragg'd the carcase through the war;
The sinewy ankles bored, the feet he bound
With thongs inserted through the double wound:
Inevitable fate o'ertakes the deed;
Doom'd by great Ajax' vengeful lance to bleed:
It cleft the helmet's brazen cheeks in twain;
The shatter'd crest and horse-hair strow the plain:
With nerves relax'd he tumbles to the ground:
The brain comes gushing through the ghastly wound:
He drops Patroclus' foot, and o'er him spread,
Now lies a sad companion of the dead:
Far from Larissa lies, his native air,
And ill requites his parents' tender care.
Lamented youth! in life's first bloom he fell,
Sent by great Ajax to the shades of hell.

Once more at Ajax Hector's javelin flies;
The Grecian marking, as it cut the skies,
Shunn'd the descending death; which hissing on,
Stretch'd in the dust the great Iphytus' son,
Schedius the brave, of all the Phocian kind
The boldest warrior and the noblest mind:
In little Panope, for strength renown'd,
He held his seat, and ruled the realms around.
Plunged in his throat, the weapon drank his blood,
And deep transpiercing through the shoulder stood;
In clanging arms the hero fell and all
The fields resounded with his weighty fall.

Phorcys, as slain Hippothous he defends,
The Telamonian lance his belly rends;
The hollow armour burst before the stroke,
And through the wound the rushing entrails broke:
In strong convulsions panting on the sands
He lies, and grasps the dust with dying hands.

Struck at the sight, recede the Trojan train:
The shouting Argives strip the heroes slain.
And now had Troy, by Greece compell'd to yield,
Fled to her ramparts, and resign'd the field;
Greece, in her native fortitude elate,
With Jove averse, had turn'd the scale of fate:
But Phoebus urged Ćneas to the fight;
He seem'd like aged Periphas to sight:
(A herald in Anchises' love grown old,
Revered for prudence, and with prudence bold.)

Thus he--"What methods yet, O chief! remain,
To save your Troy, though heaven its fall ordain?
There have been heroes, who, by virtuous care,
By valour, numbers, and by arts of war,
Have forced the powers to spare a sinking state,
And gain'd at length the glorious odds of fate:
But you, when fortune smiles, when Jove declares
His partial favour, and assists your wars,
Your shameful efforts 'gainst yourselves employ,
And force the unwilling god to ruin Troy."

Ćneas through the form assumed descries
The power conceal'd, and thus to Hector cries:
"Oh lasting shame! to our own fears a prey,
We seek our ramparts, and desert the day.
A god, nor is he less, my bosom warms,
And tells me, Jove asserts the Trojan arms."

He spoke, and foremost to the combat flew:
The bold example all his hosts pursue.
Then, first, Leocritus beneath him bled,
In vain beloved by valiant Lycomede;
Who view'd his fall, and, grieving at the chance,
Swift to revenge it sent his angry lance;
The whirling lance, with vigorous force address'd,
Descends, and pants in Apisaon's breast;
From rich Paeonia's vales the warrior came,
Next thee, Asteropeus! in place and fame.
Asteropeus with grief beheld the slain,
And rush'd to combat, but he rush'd in vain:
Indissolubly firm, around the dead,
Rank within rank, on buckler buckler spread,
And hemm'd with bristled spears, the Grecians stood,
A brazen bulwark, and an iron wood.
Great Ajax eyes them with incessant care,
And in an orb contracts the crowded war,
Close in their ranks commands to fight or fall,
And stands the centre and the soul of all:
Fix'd on the spot they war, and wounded, wound
A sanguine torrent steeps the reeking ground:
On heaps the Greeks, on heaps the Trojans bled,
And, thickening round them, rise the hills of dead.

Greece, in close order, and collected might,
Yet suffers least, and sways the wavering fight;
Fierce as conflicting fires the combat burns,
And now it rises, now it sinks by turns.
In one thick darkness all the fight was lost;
The sun, the moon, and all the ethereal host
Seem'd as extinct: day ravish'd from their eyes,
And all heaven's splendours blotted from the skies.
Such o'er Patroclus' body hung the night,
The rest in sunshine fought, and open light;
Unclouded there, the aerial azure spread,
No vapour rested on the mountain's head,
The golden sun pour'd forth a stronger ray,
And all the broad expansion flamed with day.
Dispersed around the plain, by fits they fight,
And here and there their scatter'd arrows light:
But death and darkness o'er the carcase spread,
There burn'd the war, and there the mighty bled.

Meanwhile the sons of Nestor, in the rear,
(Their fellows routed,) toss the distant spear,
And skirmish wide: so Nestor gave command,
When from the ships he sent the Pylian band.
The youthful brothers thus for fame contend,
Nor knew the fortune of Achilles' friend;
In thought they view'd him still, with martial joy,
Glorious in arms, and dealing death to Troy.

But round the corse the heroes pant for breath,
And thick and heavy grows the work of death:
O'erlabour'd now, with dust, and sweat, and gore,
Their knees, their legs, their feet, are covered o'er;
Drops follow drops, the clouds on clouds arise,
And carnage clogs their hands, and darkness fills their eyes.
As when a slaughter'd bull's yet reeking hide,
Strain'd with full force, and tugg'd from side to side,
The brawny curriers stretch; and labour o'er
The extended surface, drunk with fat and gore:
So tugging round the corse both armies stood;
The mangled body bathed in sweat and blood;
While Greeks and Ilians equal strength employ,
Now to the ships to force it, now to Troy.
Not Pallas' self, her breast when fury warms,
Nor he whose anger sets the world in arms,
Could blame this scene; such rage, such horror reign'd;
Such, Jove to honour the great dead ordain'd.

Achilles in his ships at distance lay,
Nor knew the fatal fortune of the day;
He, yet unconscious of Patroclus' fall,
In dust extended under Ilion's wall,
Expects him glorious from the conquered plain,
And for his wish'd return prepares in vain;
Though well he knew, to make proud Ilion bend
Was more than heaven had destined to his friend.
Perhaps to him: this Thetis had reveal'd;
The rest, in pity to her son, conceal'd.

Still raged the conflict round the hero dead,
And heaps on heaps by mutual wounds they bled.
"Cursed be the man (even private Greeks would say)
Who dares desert this well-disputed day!
First may the cleaving earth before our eyes
Gape wide, and drink our blood for sacrifice;
First perish all, ere haughty Troy shall boast
We lost Patroclus, and our glory lost!"

Thus they: while with one voice the Trojans said,
"Grant this day, Jove! or heap us on the dead!"

Then clash their sounding arms; the clangours rise,
And shake the brazen concave of the skies.

Meantime, at distance from the scene of blood,
The pensive steeds of great Achilles stood:
Their godlike master slain before their eyes,
They wept, and shared in human miseries.(248)
In vain Automedon now shakes the rein,
Now plies the lash, and soothes and threats in vain;
Nor to the fight nor Hellespont they go,
Restive they stood, and obstinate in woe:
Still as a tombstone, never to be moved,
On some good man or woman unreproved
Lays its eternal weight; or fix'd, as stands
A marble courser by the sculptor's hands,
Placed on the hero's grave. Along their face
The big round drops coursed down with silent pace,
Conglobing on the dust. Their manes, that late
Circled their arched necks, and waved in state,
Trail'd on the dust beneath the yoke were spread,
And prone to earth was hung their languid head:
Nor Jove disdain'd to cast a pitying look,
While thus relenting to the steeds he spoke:

"Unhappy coursers of immortal strain,
Exempt from age, and deathless, now in vain;
Did we your race on mortal man bestow,
Only, alas! to share in mortal woe?
For ah! what is there of inferior birth,
That breathes or creeps upon the dust of earth;
What wretched creature of what wretched kind,
Than man more weak, calamitous, and blind?
A miserable race! but cease to mourn:
For not by you shall Priam's son be borne
High on the splendid car: one glorious prize
He rashly boasts: the rest our will denies.
Ourself will swiftness to your nerves impart,
Ourself with rising spirits swell your heart.
Automedon your rapid flight shall bear
Safe to the navy through the storm of war.
For yet 'tis given to Troy to ravage o'er
The field, and spread her slaughters to the shore;
The sun shall see her conquer, till his fall
With sacred darkness shades the face of all."

He said; and breathing in the immortal horse
Excessive spirit, urged them to the course;
From their high manes they shake the dust, and bear
The kindling chariot through the parted war:
So flies a vulture through the clamorous train
Of geese, that scream, and scatter round the plain.
From danger now with swiftest speed they flew,
And now to conquest with like speed pursue;
Sole in the seat the charioteer remains,
Now plies the javelin, now directs the reins:
Him brave Alcimedon beheld distress'd,
Approach'd the chariot, and the chief address'd:

"What god provokes thee rashly thus to dare,
Alone, unaided, in the thickest war?
Alas! thy friend is slain, and Hector wields
Achilles' arms triumphant in the fields."

"In happy time (the charioteer replies)
The bold Alcimedon now greets my eyes;
No Greek like him the heavenly steeds restrains,
Or holds their fury in suspended reins:
Patroclus, while he lived, their rage could tame,
But now Patroclus is an empty name!
To thee I yield the seat, to thee resign
The ruling charge: the task of fight be mine."

He said. Alcimedon, with active heat,
Snatches the reins, and vaults into the seat.
His friend descends. The chief of Troy descried,
And call'd Ćneas fighting near his side.

"Lo, to my sight, beyond our hope restored,
Achilles' car, deserted of its lord!
The glorious steeds our ready arms invite,
Scarce their weak drivers guide them through the fight.
Can such opponents stand when we assail?
Unite thy force, my friend, and we prevail."

The son of Venus to the counsel yields;
Then o'er their backs they spread their solid shields:
With brass refulgent the broad surface shined,
And thick bull-hides the spacious concave lined.
Them Chromius follows, Aretus succeeds;
Each hopes the conquest of the lofty steeds:
In vain, brave youths, with glorious hopes ye burn,
In vain advance! not fated to return.

Unmov'd, Automedon attends the fight,
Implores the Eternal, and collects his might.
Then turning to his friend, with dauntless mind:
"Oh keep the foaming coursers close behind!
Full on my shoulders let their nostrils blow,
For hard the fight, determined is the foe;
'Tis Hector comes: and when he seeks the prize,
War knows no mean; he wins it or he dies."

Then through the field he sends his voice aloud,
And calls the Ajaces from the warring crowd,
With great Atrides. "Hither turn, (he said,)
Turn where distress demands immediate aid;
The dead, encircled by his friends, forego,
And save the living from a fiercer foe.
Unhelp'd we stand, unequal to engage
The force of Hector, and Ćneas' rage:
Yet mighty as they are, my force to prove
Is only mine: the event belongs to Jove."

He spoke, and high the sounding javelin flung,
Which pass'd the shield of Aretus the young:
It pierced his belt, emboss'd with curious art,
Then in the lower belly struck the dart.
As when a ponderous axe, descending full,
Cleaves the broad forehead of some brawny bull:(249)
Struck 'twixt the horns, he springs with many a bound,
Then tumbling rolls enormous on the ground:
Thus fell the youth; the air his soul received,
And the spear trembled as his entrails heaved.

Now at Automedon the Trojan foe
Discharged his lance; the meditated blow,
Stooping, he shunn'd; the javelin idly fled,
And hiss'd innoxious o'er the hero's head;
Deep rooted in the ground, the forceful spear
In long vibrations spent its fury there.
With clashing falchions now the chiefs had closed,
But each brave Ajax heard, and interposed;
Nor longer Hector with his Trojans stood,
But left their slain companion in his blood:
His arms Automedon divests, and cries,
"Accept, Patroclus, this mean sacrifice:
Thus have I soothed my griefs, and thus have paid,
Poor as it is, some offering to thy shade."

So looks the lion o'er a mangled boar,
All grim with rage, and horrible with gore;
High on the chariot at one bound he sprung,
And o'er his seat the bloody trophies hung.

And now Minerva from the realms of air
Descends impetuous, and renews the war;
For, pleased at length the Grecian arms to aid,
The lord of thunders sent the blue-eyed maid.
As when high Jove denouncing future woe,
O'er the dark clouds extends his purple bow,
(In sign of tempests from the troubled air,
Or from the rage of man, destructive war,)
The drooping cattle dread the impending skies,
And from his half-till'd field the labourer flies:
In such a form the goddess round her drew
A livid cloud, and to the battle flew.
Assuming Phoenix' shape on earth she falls,
And in his well-known voice to Sparta calls:
"And lies Achilles' friend, beloved by all,
A prey to dogs beneath the Trojan wall?
What shame 'o Greece for future times to tell,
To thee the greatest in whose cause he fell!"
"O chief, O father! (Atreus' son replies)
O full of days! by long experience wise!
What more desires my soul, than here unmoved
To guard the body of the man I loved?
Ah, would Minerva send me strength to rear
This wearied arm, and ward the storm of war!
But Hector, like the rage of fire, we dread,
And Jove's own glories blaze around his head!"

Pleased to be first of all the powers address'd,
She breathes new vigour in her hero's breast,
And fills with keen revenge, with fell despite,
Desire of blood, and rage, and lust of fight.
So burns the vengeful hornet (soul all o'er),
Repulsed in vain, and thirsty still of gore;
(Bold son of air and heat) on angry wings
Untamed, untired, he turns, attacks, and stings.
Fired with like ardour fierce Atrides flew,
And sent his soul with every lance he threw.

There stood a Trojan, not unknown to fame,
Aetion's son, and Podes was his name:
With riches honour'd, and with courage bless'd,
By Hector loved, his comrade, and his guest;
Through his broad belt the spear a passage found,
And, ponderous as he falls, his arms resound.
Sudden at Hector's side Apollo stood,
Like Phaenops, Asius' son, appear'd the god;
(Asius the great, who held his wealthy reign
In fair Abydos, by the rolling main.)

"Oh prince! (he cried) Oh foremost once in fame!
What Grecian now shall tremble at thy name?
Dost thou at length to Menelaus yield,
A chief once thought no terror of the field?
Yet singly, now, the long-disputed prize
He bears victorious, while our army flies:
By the same arm illustrious Podes bled;
The friend of Hector, unrevenged, is dead!"
This heard, o'er Hector spreads a cloud of woe,
Rage lifts his lance, and drives him on the foe.

But now the Eternal shook his sable shield,
That shaded Ide and all the subject field
Beneath its ample verge. A rolling cloud
Involved the mount; the thunder roar'd aloud;
The affrighted hills from their foundations nod,
And blaze beneath the lightnings of the god:
At one regard of his all-seeing eye
The vanquish'd triumph, and the victors fly.

Then trembled Greece: the flight Peneleus led;
For as the brave Boeotian turn'd his head
To face the foe, Polydamas drew near,
And razed his shoulder with a shorten'd spear:
By Hector wounded, Leitus quits the plain,
Pierced through the wrist; and raging with the pain,
Grasps his once formidable lance in vain.

As Hector follow'd, Idomen address'd
The flaming javelin to his manly breast;
The brittle point before his corslet yields;
Exulting Troy with clamour fills the fields:
High on his chariots the Cretan stood,
The son of Priam whirl'd the massive wood.
But erring from its aim, the impetuous spear
Struck to the dust the squire and charioteer
Of martial Merion: Coeranus his name,
Who left fair Lyctus for the fields of fame.
On foot bold Merion fought; and now laid low,
Had graced the triumphs of his Trojan foe,
But the brave squire the ready coursers brought,
And with his life his master's safety bought.
Between his cheek and ear the weapon went,
The teeth it shatter'd, and the tongue it rent.
Prone from the seat he tumbles to the plain;
His dying hand forgets the falling rein:
This Merion reaches, bending from the car,
And urges to desert the hopeless war:
Idomeneus consents; the lash applies;
And the swift chariot to the navy flies.

Not Ajax less the will of heaven descried,
And conquest shifting to the Trojan side,
Turn'd by the hand of Jove. Then thus begun,
To Atreus's seed, the godlike Telamon:

"Alas! who sees not Jove's almighty hand
Transfers the glory to the Trojan band?
Whether the weak or strong discharge the dart,
He guides each arrow to a Grecian heart:
Not so our spears; incessant though they rain,
He suffers every lance to fall in vain.
Deserted of the god, yet let us try
What human strength and prudence can supply;
If yet this honour'd corse, in triumph borne,
May glad the fleets that hope not our return,
Who tremble yet, scarce rescued from their fates,
And still hear Hector thundering at their gates.
Some hero too must be despatch'd to bear
The mournful message to Pelides' ear;
For sure he knows not, distant on the shore,
His friend, his loved Patroclus, is no more.
But such a chief I spy not through the host:
The men, the steeds, the armies, all are lost
In general darkness--Lord of earth and air!
Oh king! Oh father! hear my humble prayer:
Dispel this cloud, the light of heaven restore;
Give me to see, and Ajax asks no more:
If Greece must perish, we thy will obey,
But let us perish in the face of day!"

With tears the hero spoke, and at his prayer
The god relenting clear'd the clouded air;
Forth burst the sun with all-enlightening ray;
The blaze of armour flash'd against the day.
"Now, now, Atrides! cast around thy sight;
If yet Antilochus survives the fight,
Let him to great Achilles' ear convey
The fatal news"--Atrides hastes away.

So turns the lion from the nightly fold,
Though high in courage, and with hunger bold,
Long gall'd by herdsmen, and long vex'd by hounds,
Stiff with fatigue, and fretted sore with wounds;
The darts fly round him from a hundred hands,
And the red terrors of the blazing brands:
Till late, reluctant, at the dawn of day
Sour he departs, and quits the untasted prey,
So moved Atrides from his dangerous place
With weary limbs, but with unwilling pace;
The foe, he fear'd, might yet Patroclus gain,
And much admonish'd, much adjured his train:

"O guard these relics to your charge consign'd,
And bear the merits of the dead in mind;
How skill'd he was in each obliging art;
The mildest manners, and the gentlest heart:
He was, alas! but fate decreed his end,
In death a hero, as in life a friend!"

So parts the chief; from rank to rank he flew,
And round on all sides sent his piercing view.
As the bold bird, endued with sharpest eye
Of all that wings the mid aerial sky,
The sacred eagle, from his walks above
Looks down, and sees the distant thicket move;
Then stoops, and sousing on the quivering hare,
Snatches his life amid the clouds of air.
Not with less quickness, his exerted sight
Pass'd this and that way, through the ranks of fight:
Till on the left the chief he sought, he found,
Cheering his men, and spreading deaths around:

To him the king: "Beloved of Jove! draw near,
For sadder tidings never touch'd thy ear;
Thy eyes have witness'd what a fatal turn!
How Ilion triumphs, and the Achaians mourn.
This is not all: Patroclus, on the shore
Now pale and dead, shall succour Greece no more.
Fly to the fleet, this instant fly, and tell
The sad Achilles, how his loved-one fell:
He too may haste the naked corse to gain:
The arms are Hector's, who despoil'd the slain."

The youthful warrior heard with silent woe,
From his fair eyes the tears began to flow:
Big with the mighty grief, he strove to say
What sorrow dictates, but no word found way.
To brave Laodocus his arms he flung,
Who, near him wheeling, drove his steeds along;
Then ran the mournful message to impart,
With tearful eyes, and with dejected heart.

Swift fled the youth: nor Menelaus stands
(Though sore distress'd) to aid the Pylian bands;
But bids bold Thrasymede those troops sustain;
Himself returns to his Patroclus slain.
"Gone is Antilochus (the hero said);
But hope not, warriors, for Achilles' aid:
Though fierce his rage, unbounded be his woe,
Unarm'd, he fights not with the Trojan foe.
'Tis in our hands alone our hopes remain,
'Tis our own vigour must the dead regain,
And save ourselves, while with impetuous hate
Troy pours along, and this way rolls our fate."

"'Tis well (said Ajax), be it then thy care,
With Merion's aid, the weighty corse to rear;
Myself, and my bold brother will sustain
The shock of Hector and his charging train:
Nor fear we armies, fighting side by side;
What Troy can dare, we have already tried,
Have tried it, and have stood." The hero said.
High from the ground the warriors heave the dead.
A general clamour rises at the sight:
Loud shout the Trojans, and renew the fight.
Not fiercer rush along the gloomy wood,
With rage insatiate, and with thirst of blood,
Voracious hounds, that many a length before
Their furious hunters, drive the wounded boar;
But if the savage turns his glaring eye,
They howl aloof, and round the forest fly.
Thus on retreating Greece the Trojans pour,
Wave their thick falchions, and their javelins shower:
But Ajax turning, to their fears they yield,
All pale they tremble and forsake the field.

While thus aloft the hero's corse they bear,
Behind them rages all the storm of war:
Confusion, tumult, horror, o'er the throng
Of men, steeds, chariots, urged the rout along:
Less fierce the winds with rising flames conspire
To whelm some city under waves of fire;
Now sink in gloomy clouds the proud abodes,
Now crack the blazing temples of the gods;
The rumbling torrent through the ruin rolls,
And sheets of smoke mount heavy to the poles.
The heroes sweat beneath their honour'd load:
As when two mules, along the rugged road,
From the steep mountain with exerted strength
Drag some vast beam, or mast's unwieldy length;
Inly they groan, big drops of sweat distil,
The enormous timber lumbering down the hill:
So these--Behind, the bulk of Ajax stands,
And breaks the torrent of the rushing bands.
Thus when a river swell'd with sudden rains
Spreads his broad waters o'er the level plains,
Some interposing hill the stream divides.
And breaks its force, and turns the winding tides.
Still close they follow, close the rear engage;
Aeneas storms, and Hector foams with rage:
While Greece a heavy, thick retreat maintains,
Wedged in one body, like a flight of cranes,
That shriek incessant, while the falcon, hung
High on poised pinions, threats their callow young.
So from the Trojan chiefs the Grecians fly,
Such the wild terror, and the mingled cry:
Within, without the trench, and all the way,
Strow'd in bright heaps, their arms and armour lay;
Such horror Jove impress'd! yet still proceeds
The work of death, and still the battle bleeds.

                     VULCAN FROM AN ANTIQUE GEM.





BOOK XVIII.


ARGUMENT.

THE GRIEF OF ACHILLES, AND NEW ARMOUR MADE HIM BY VULCAN.

The news of the death of Patroclus is brought to Achilles by Antilochus.
Thetis, hearing his lamentations, comes with all her sea- nymphs to
comfort him. The speeches of the mother and son on this occasion. Iris
appears to Achilles by the command of Juno, and orders him to show himself
at the head of the intrenchments. The sight of him turns the fortunes of
the day, and the body of Patroclus is carried off by the Greeks. The
Trojans call a council, where Hector and Polydamas disagree in their
opinions: but the advice of the former prevails, to remain encamped in the
field. The grief of Achilles over the body of Patroclus.

Thetis goes to the palace of Vulcan to obtain new arms for her son. The
description of the wonderful works of Vulcan: and, lastly, that noble one
of the shield of Achilles.

The latter part of the nine-and-twentieth day, and the night ensuing, take
up this book: the scene is at Achilles' tent on the sea-shore, from whence
it changes to the palace of Vulcan.

Thus like the rage of fire the combat burns,(250)
And now it rises, now it sinks by turns.
Meanwhile, where Hellespont's broad waters flow,
Stood Nestor's son, the messenger of woe:
There sat Achilles, shaded by his sails,
On hoisted yards extended to the gales;
Pensive he sat; for all that fate design'd
Rose in sad prospect to his boding mind.
Thus to his soul he said: "Ah! what constrains
The Greeks, late victors, now to quit the plains?
Is this the day, which heaven so long ago
Ordain'd, to sink me with the weight of woe?
(So Thetis warn'd;) when by a Trojan hand
The bravest of the Myrmidonian band
Should lose the light! Fulfilled is that decree;
Fallen is the warrior, and Patroclus he!
In vain I charged him soon to quit the plain,
And warn'd to shun Hectorean force in vain!"

Thus while he thinks, Antilochus appears,
And tells the melancholy tale with tears.
"Sad tidings, son of Peleus! thou must hear;
And wretched I, the unwilling messenger!
Dead is Patroclus! For his corse they fight;
His naked corse: his arms are Hector's right."

A sudden horror shot through all the chief,
And wrapp'd his senses in the cloud of grief;
Cast on the ground, with furious hands he spread
The scorching ashes o'er his graceful head;
His purple garments, and his golden hairs,
Those he deforms with dust, and these he tears;
On the hard soil his groaning breast he threw,
And roll'd and grovell'd, as to earth he grew.
The virgin captives, with disorder'd charms,
(Won by his own, or by Patroclus' arms,)
Rush'd from their tents with cries; and gathering round,
Beat their white breasts, and fainted on the ground:
While Nestor's son sustains a manlier part,
And mourns the warrior with a warrior's heart;
Hangs on his arms, amidst his frantic woe,
And oft prevents the meditated blow.

Far in the deep abysses of the main,(251)
With hoary Nereus, and the watery train,
The mother-goddess from her crystal throne
Heard his loud cries, and answer'd groan for groan.
The circling Nereids with their mistress weep,
And all the sea-green sisters of the deep.
Thalia, Glauce (every watery name),
Nesaea mild, and silver Spio came:
Cymothoe and Cymodoce were nigh,
And the blue languish of soft Alia's eye.
Their locks Actaea and Limnoria rear,
Then Proto, Doris, Panope appear,
Thoa, Pherusa, Doto, Melita;
Agave gentle, and Amphithoe gay:
Next Callianira, Callianassa show
Their sister looks; Dexamene the slow,
And swift Dynamene, now cut the tides:
Iaera now the verdant wave divides:
Nemertes with Apseudes lifts the head,
Bright Galatea quits her pearly bed;
These Orythia, Clymene, attend,
Maera, Amphinome, the train extend;
And black Janira, and Janassa fair,
And Amatheia with her amber hair.
All these, and all that deep in ocean held
Their sacred seats, the glimmering grotto fill'd;
Each beat her ivory breast with silent woe,
Till Thetis' sorrows thus began to flow:

"Hear me, and judge, ye sisters of the main!
How just a cause has Thetis to complain!
How wretched, were I mortal, were my fate!
How more than wretched in the immortal state!
Sprung from my bed a godlike hero came,
The bravest far that ever bore the name;
Like some fair olive, by my careful hand
He grew, he flourish'd and adorn'd the land
To Troy I sent him: but the fates ordain
He never, never must return again.
So short a space the light of heaven to view,
So short, alas! and fill'd with anguish too!
Hear how his sorrows echo through the shore!
I cannot ease them, but I must deplore;
I go at least to bear a tender part,
And mourn my loved-one with a mother's heart."

She said, and left the caverns of the main,
All bathed in tears; the melancholy train
Attend her way. Wide-opening part the tides,
While the long pomp the silver wave divides.
Approaching now, they touch'd the Trojan land;
Then, two by two, ascended up the strand.
The immortal mother, standing close beside
Her mournful offspring, to his sighs replied;
Along the coast their mingled clamours ran,
And thus the silver-footed dame began:

"Why mourns my son? thy late preferr'd request
The god has granted, and the Greeks distress'd:
Why mourns my son? thy anguish let me share,
Reveal the cause, and trust a parent's care."

He, deeply groaning--"To this cureless grief,
Not even the Thunderer's favour brings relief.
Patroclus--Ah!--say, goddess, can I boast
A pleasure now? revenge itself is lost;
Patroclus, loved of all my martial train,
Beyond mankind, beyond myself is slain!
Lost are those arms the gods themselves bestow'd
On Peleus; Hector bears the glorious load.
Cursed be that day, when all the powers above
Thy charms submitted to a mortal love:
O hadst thou still, a sister of the main,
Pursued the pleasures of the watery reign:
And happier Peleus, less ambitious, led
A mortal beauty to his equal bed!
Ere the sad fruit of thy unhappy womb
Had caused such sorrows past, and woes to come.
For soon, alas! that wretched offspring slain,
New woes, new sorrows, shall create again.
'Tis not in fate the alternate now to give;
Patroclus dead, Achilles hates to live.
Let me revenge it on proud Hector's heart,
Let his last spirit smoke upon my dart;
On these conditions will I breathe: till then,
I blush to walk among the race of men."

A flood of tears, at this, the goddess shed:
"Ah then, I see thee dying, see thee dead!
When Hector falls, thou diest."--"Let Hector die,
And let me fall! (Achilles made reply)
Far lies Patroclus from his native plain!
He fell, and falling, wish'd my aid in vain.
Ah then, since from this miserable day
I cast all hope of my return away;
Since, unrevenged, a hundred ghosts demand
The fate of Hector from Achilles' hand;
Since here, for brutal courage far renown'd,
I live an idle burden to the ground,
(Others in council famed for nobler skill,
More useful to preserve, than I to kill,)
Let me--But oh! ye gracious powers above!
Wrath and revenge from men and gods remove:
Far, far too dear to every mortal breast,
Sweet to the soul, as honey to the taste:
Gathering like vapours of a noxious kind
From fiery blood, and darkening all the mind.
Me Agamemnon urged to deadly hate;
'Tis past--I quell it; I resign to fate.
Yes--I will meet the murderer of my friend;
Or (if the gods ordain it) meet my end.
The stroke of fate the strongest cannot shun:
The great Alcides, Jove's unequall'd son,
To Juno's hate, at length resign'd his breath,
And sunk the victim of all-conquering death.
So shall Achilles fall! stretch'd pale and dead,
No more the Grecian hope, or Trojan dread!
Let me, this instant, rush into the fields,
And reap what glory life's short harvest yields.
Shall I not force some widow'd dame to tear
With frantic hands her long dishevell'd hair?
Shall I not force her breast to heave with sighs,
And the soft tears to trickle from her eyes?
Yes, I shall give the fair those mournful charms--
In vain you hold me--Hence! my arms! my arms!--
Soon shall the sanguine torrent spread so wide,
That all shall know Achilles swells the tide."

"My son (coerulean Thetis made reply,
To fate submitting with a secret sigh,)
The host to succour, and thy friends to save,
Is worthy thee; the duty of the brave.
But canst thou, naked, issue to the plains?
Thy radiant arms the Trojan foe detains.
Insulting Hector bears the spoils on high,
But vainly glories, for his fate is nigh.
Yet, yet awhile thy generous ardour stay;
Assured, I meet thee at the dawn of day,
Charged with refulgent arms (a glorious load),
Vulcanian arms, the labour of a god."

Then turning to the daughters of the main,
The goddess thus dismiss'd her azure train:

"Ye sister Nereids! to your deeps descend;
Haste, and our father's sacred seat attend;
I go to find the architect divine,
Where vast Olympus' starry summits shine:
So tell our hoary sire"--This charge she gave:
The sea-green sisters plunge beneath the wave:
Thetis once more ascends the bless'd abodes,
And treads the brazen threshold of the gods.

 [Illustration: THETIS ORDERING THE NEREIDS TO DESCEND INTO THE SEA.]

         THETIS ORDERING THE NEREIDS TO DESCEND INTO THE SEA.


And now the Greeks from furious Hector's force,
Urge to broad Hellespont their headlong course;
Nor yet their chiefs Patroclus' body bore
Safe through the tempest to the tented shore.
The horse, the foot, with equal fury join'd,
Pour'd on the rear, and thunder'd close behind:
And like a flame through fields of ripen'd corn,
The rage of Hector o'er the ranks was borne.
Thrice the slain hero by the foot he drew;
Thrice to the skies the Trojan clamours flew:
As oft the Ajaces his assault sustain;
But check'd, he turns; repuls'd, attacks again.
With fiercer shouts his lingering troops he fires,
Nor yields a step, nor from his post retires:
So watchful shepherds strive to force, in vain,
The hungry lion from a carcase slain.
Even yet Patroclus had he borne away,
And all the glories of the extended day,
Had not high Juno from the realms of air,
Secret, despatch'd her trusty messenger.
The various goddess of the showery bow,
Shot in a whirlwind to the shore below;
To great Achilles at his ships she came,
And thus began the many-colour'd dame:

"Rise, son of Peleus! rise, divinely brave!
Assist the combat, and Patroclus save:
For him the slaughter to the fleet they spread,
And fall by mutual wounds around the dead.
To drag him back to Troy the foe contends:
Nor with his death the rage of Hector ends:
A prey to dogs he dooms the corse to lie,
And marks the place to fix his head on high.
Rise, and prevent (if yet you think of fame)
Thy friend's disgrace, thy own eternal shame!"

"Who sends thee, goddess, from the ethereal skies?"
Achilles thus. And Iris thus replies:

"I come, Pelides! from the queen of Jove,
The immortal empress of the realms above;
Unknown to him who sits remote on high,
Unknown to all the synod of the sky."
"Thou comest in vain (he cries, with fury warm'd);
Arms I have none, and can I fight unarm'd?
Unwilling as I am, of force I stay,
Till Thetis bring me at the dawn of day
Vulcanian arms: what other can I wield,
Except the mighty Telamonian shield?
That, in my friend's defence, has Ajax spread,
While his strong lance around him heaps the dead:
The gallant chief defends Menoetius' son,
And does what his Achilles should have done."

"Thy want of arms (said Iris) well we know;
But though unarm'd, yet clad in terrors, go!
Let but Achilles o'er yon trench appear,
Proud Troy shall tremble, and consent to fear;
Greece from one glance of that tremendous eye
Shall take new courage, and disdain to fly."

She spoke, and pass'd in air. The hero rose:
Her aegis Pallas o'er his shoulder throws;
Around his brows a golden cloud she spread;
A stream of glory flamed above his head.
As when from some beleaguer'd town arise
The smokes, high curling to the shaded skies;
(Seen from some island, o'er the main afar,
When men distress'd hang out the sign of war;)
Soon as the sun in ocean hides his rays,
Thick on the hills the flaming beacons blaze;
With long-projected beams the seas are bright,
And heaven's high arch reflects the ruddy light:
So from Achilles' head the splendours rise,
Reflecting blaze on blaze against the skies.
Forth march'd the chief, and distant from the crowd,
High on the rampart raised his voice aloud;
With her own shout Minerva swells the sound;
Troy starts astonish'd, and the shores rebound.
As the loud trumpet's brazen mouth from far
With shrilling clangour sounds the alarm of war,
Struck from the walls, the echoes float on high,
And the round bulwarks and thick towers reply;
So high his brazen voice the hero rear'd:
Hosts dropp'd their arms, and trembled as they heard:
And back the chariots roll, and coursers bound,
And steeds and men lie mingled on the ground.
Aghast they see the living lightnings play,
And turn their eyeballs from the flashing ray.
Thrice from the trench his dreadful voice he raised,
And thrice they fled, confounded and amazed.
Twelve in the tumult wedged, untimely rush'd
On their own spears, by their own chariots crush'd:
While, shielded from the darts, the Greeks obtain
The long-contended carcase of the slain.

A lofty bier the breathless warrior bears:
Around, his sad companions melt in tears.
But chief Achilles, bending down his head,
Pours unavailing sorrows o'er the dead,
Whom late triumphant, with his steeds and car,
He sent refulgent to the field of war;
(Unhappy change!) now senseless, pale, he found,
Stretch'd forth, and gash'd with many a gaping wound.

Meantime, unwearied with his heavenly way,
In ocean's waves the unwilling light of day
Quench'd his red orb, at Juno's high command,
And from their labours eased the Achaian band.
The frighted Trojans (panting from the war,
Their steeds unharness'd from the weary car)
A sudden council call'd: each chief appear'd
In haste, and standing; for to sit they fear'd.
'Twas now no season for prolong'd debate;
They saw Achilles, and in him their fate.
Silent they stood: Polydamas at last,
Skill'd to discern the future by the past,
The son of Panthus, thus express'd his fears
(The friend of Hector, and of equal years;
The self-same night to both a being gave,
One wise in council, one in action brave):

           [Illustration: JUNO COMMANDING THE SUN TO SET.]

                   JUNO COMMANDING THE SUN TO SET.


"In free debate, my friends, your sentence speak;
For me, I move, before the morning break,
To raise our camp: too dangerous here our post,
Far from Troy walls, and on a naked coast.
I deem'd not Greece so dreadful, while engaged
In mutual feuds her king and hero raged;
Then, while we hoped our armies might prevail
We boldly camp'd beside a thousand sail.
I dread Pelides now: his rage of mind
Not long continues to the shores confined,
Nor to the fields, where long in equal fray
Contending nations won and lost the day;
For Troy, for Troy, shall henceforth be the strife,
And the hard contest not for fame, but life.
Haste then to Ilion, while the favouring night
Detains these terrors, keeps that arm from fight.
If but the morrow's sun behold us here,
That arm, those terrors, we shall feel, not fear;
And hearts that now disdain, shall leap with joy,
If heaven permit them then to enter Troy.
Let not my fatal prophecy be true,
Nor what I tremble but to think, ensue.
Whatever be our fate, yet let us try
What force of thought and reason can supply;
Let us on counsel for our guard depend;
The town her gates and bulwarks shall defend.
When morning dawns, our well-appointed powers,
Array'd in arms, shall line the lofty towers.
Let the fierce hero, then, when fury calls,
Vent his mad vengeance on our rocky walls,
Or fetch a thousand circles round the plain,
Till his spent coursers seek the fleet again:
So may his rage be tired, and labour'd down!
And dogs shall tear him ere he sack the town."

"Return! (said Hector, fired with stern disdain)
What! coop whole armies in our walls again?
Was't not enough, ye valiant warriors, say,
Nine years imprison'd in those towers ye lay?
Wide o'er the world was Ilion famed of old
For brass exhaustless, and for mines of gold:
But while inglorious in her walls we stay'd,
Sunk were her treasures, and her stores decay'd;
The Phrygians now her scatter'd spoils enjoy,
And proud Maeonia wastes the fruits of Troy.
Great Jove at length my arms to conquest calls,
And shuts the Grecians in their wooden walls,
Darest thou dispirit whom the gods incite?
Flies any Trojan? I shall stop his flight.
To better counsel then attention lend;
Take due refreshment, and the watch attend.
If there be one whose riches cost him care,
Forth let him bring them for the troops to share;
'Tis better generously bestow'd on those,
Than left the plunder of our country's foes.
Soon as the morn the purple orient warms,
Fierce on yon navy will we pour our arms.
If great Achilles rise in all his might,
His be the danger: I shall stand the fight.
Honour, ye gods! or let me gain or give;
And live he glorious, whosoe'er shall live!
Mars is our common lord, alike to all;
And oft the victor triumphs, but to fall."

The shouting host in loud applauses join'd;
So Pallas robb'd the many of their mind;
To their own sense condemn'd, and left to choose
The worst advice, the better to refuse.

While the long night extends her sable reign,
Around Patroclus mourn'd the Grecian train.
Stern in superior grief Pelides stood;
Those slaughtering arms, so used to bathe in blood,
Now clasp his clay-cold limbs: then gushing start
The tears, and sighs burst from his swelling heart.
The lion thus, with dreadful anguish stung,
Roars through the desert, and demands his young;
When the grim savage, to his rifled den
Too late returning, snuffs the track of men,
And o'er the vales and o'er the forest bounds;
His clamorous grief the bellowing wood resounds.
So grieves Achilles; and, impetuous, vents
To all his Myrmidons his loud laments.

"In what vain promise, gods! did I engage,
When to console Menoetius' feeble age,
I vowed his much-loved offspring to restore,
Charged with rich spoils, to fair Opuntia's shore?(252)
But mighty Jove cuts short, with just disdain,
The long, long views of poor designing man!
One fate the warrior and the friend shall strike,
And Troy's black sands must drink our blood alike:
Me too a wretched mother shall deplore,
An aged father never see me more!
Yet, my Patroclus! yet a space I stay,
Then swift pursue thee on the darksome way.
Ere thy dear relics in the grave are laid,
Shall Hector's head be offer'd to thy shade;
That, with his arms, shall hang before thy shrine;
And twelve, the noblest of the Trojan line,
Sacred to vengeance, by this hand expire;
Their lives effused around thy flaming pyre.
Thus let me lie till then! thus, closely press'd,
Bathe thy cold face, and sob upon thy breast!
While Trojan captives here thy mourners stay,
Weep all the night and murmur all the day:
Spoils of my arms, and thine; when, wasting wide,
Our swords kept time, and conquer'd side by side."

He spoke, and bade the sad attendants round
Cleanse the pale corse, and wash each honour'd wound.
A massy caldron of stupendous frame
They brought, and placed it o'er the rising flame:
Then heap'd the lighted wood; the flame divides
Beneath the vase, and climbs around the sides:
In its wide womb they pour the rushing stream;
The boiling water bubbles to the brim.
The body then they bathe with pious toil,
Embalm the wounds, anoint the limbs with oil,
High on a bed of state extended laid,
And decent cover'd with a linen shade;
Last o'er the dead the milk-white veil they threw;
That done, their sorrows and their sighs renew.

Meanwhile to Juno, in the realms above,
(His wife and sister,) spoke almighty Jove.
"At last thy will prevails: great Peleus' son
Rises in arms: such grace thy Greeks have won.
Say (for I know not), is their race divine,
And thou the mother of that martial line?"

"What words are these? (the imperial dame replies,
While anger flash'd from her majestic eyes)
Succour like this a mortal arm might lend,
And such success mere human wit attend:
And shall not I, the second power above,
Heaven's queen, and consort of the thundering Jove,
Say, shall not I one nation's fate command,
Not wreak my vengeance on one guilty land?"

                       [Illustration: TRIPOD.]

                               TRIPOD.


So they. Meanwhile the silver-footed dame
Reach'd the Vulcanian dome, eternal frame!
High-eminent amid the works divine,
Where heaven's far-beaming brazen mansions shine.
There the lame architect the goddess found,
Obscure in smoke, his forges flaming round,
While bathed in sweat from fire to fire he flew;
And puffing loud, the roaring billows blew.
That day no common task his labour claim'd:
Full twenty tripods for his hall he framed,
That placed on living wheels of massy gold,
(Wondrous to tell,) instinct with spirit roll'd
From place to place, around the bless'd abodes
Self-moved, obedient to the beck of gods:
For their fair handles now, o'erwrought with flowers,
In moulds prepared, the glowing ore he pours.
Just as responsive to his thought the frame
Stood prompt to move, the azure goddess came:
Charis, his spouse, a grace divinely fair,
(With purple fillets round her braided hair,)
Observed her entering; her soft hand she press'd,
And, smiling, thus the watery queen address'd:

"What, goddess! this unusual favour draws?
All hail, and welcome! whatsoe'er the cause;
Till now a stranger, in a happy hour
Approach, and taste the dainties of the bower."

   [Illustration: THETIS AND EURYNOME RECEIVING THE INFANT VULCAN.]

           THETIS AND EURYNOME RECEIVING THE INFANT VULCAN.


High on a throne, with stars of silver graced,
And various artifice, the queen she placed;
A footstool at her feet: then calling, said,
"Vulcan, draw near, 'tis Thetis asks your aid."
"Thetis (replied the god) our powers may claim,
An ever-dear, an ever-honour'd name!
When my proud mother hurl'd me from the sky,
(My awkward form, it seems, displeased her eye,)
She, and Eurynome, my griefs redress'd,
And soft received me on their silver breast.
Even then these arts employ'd my infant thought:
Chains, bracelets, pendants, all their toys, I wrought.
Nine years kept secret in the dark abode,
Secure I lay, conceal'd from man and god:
Deep in a cavern'd rock my days were led;
The rushing ocean murmur'd o'er my head.
Now, since her presence glads our mansion, say,
For such desert what service can I pay?
Vouchsafe, O Thetis! at our board to share
The genial rites, and hospitable fare;
While I the labours of the forge forego,
And bid the roaring bellows cease to blow."

Then from his anvil the lame artist rose;
Wide with distorted legs oblique he goes,
And stills the bellows, and (in order laid)
Locks in their chests his instruments of trade.
Then with a sponge the sooty workman dress'd
His brawny arms embrown'd, and hairy breast.
With his huge sceptre graced, and red attire,
Came halting forth the sovereign of the fire:
The monarch's steps two female forms uphold,
That moved and breathed in animated gold;
To whom was voice, and sense, and science given
Of works divine (such wonders are in heaven!)
On these supported, with unequal gait,
He reach'd the throne where pensive Thetis sate;
There placed beside her on the shining frame,
He thus address'd the silver-footed dame:

"Thee, welcome, goddess! what occasion calls
(So long a stranger) to these honour'd walls?
'Tis thine, fair Thetis, the command to lay,
And Vulcan's joy and duty to obey."

         [Illustration: VULCAN AND CHARIS RECEIVING THETIS.]

                 VULCAN AND CHARIS RECEIVING THETIS.


To whom the mournful mother thus replies:
(The crystal drops stood trembling in her eyes:)
"O Vulcan! say, was ever breast divine
So pierced with sorrows, so o'erwhelm'd as mine?
Of all the goddesses, did Jove prepare
For Thetis only such a weight of care?
I, only I, of all the watery race
By force subjected to a man's embrace,
Who, sinking now with age and sorrow, pays
The mighty fine imposed on length of days.
Sprung from my bed, a godlike hero came,
The bravest sure that ever bore the name;
Like some fair plant beneath my careful hand
He grew, he flourish'd, and he graced the land:
To Troy I sent him! but his native shore
Never, ah never, shall receive him more;
(Even while he lives, he wastes with secret woe;)
Nor I, a goddess, can retard the blow!
Robb'd of the prize the Grecian suffrage gave,
The king of nations forced his royal slave:
For this he grieved; and, till the Greeks oppress'd
Required his arm, he sorrow'd unredress'd.
Large gifts they promise, and their elders send;
In vain--he arms not, but permits his friend
His arms, his steeds, his forces to employ:
He marches, combats, almost conquers Troy:
Then slain by Phoebus (Hector had the name)
At once resigns his armour, life, and fame.
But thou, in pity, by my prayer be won:
Grace with immortal arms this short-lived son,
And to the field in martial pomp restore,
To shine with glory, till he shines no more!"

To her the artist-god: "Thy griefs resign,
Secure, what Vulcan can, is ever thine.
O could I hide him from the Fates, as well,
Or with these hands the cruel stroke repel,
As I shall forge most envied arms, the gaze
Of wondering ages, and the world's amaze!"

Thus having said, the father of the fires
To the black labours of his forge retires.
Soon as he bade them blow, the bellows turn'd
Their iron mouths; and where the furnace burn'd,
Resounding breathed: at once the blast expires,
And twenty forges catch at once the fires;
Just as the god directs, now loud, now low,
They raise a tempest, or they gently blow;
In hissing flames huge silver bars are roll'd,
And stubborn brass, and tin, and solid gold;
Before, deep fix'd, the eternal anvils stand;
The ponderous hammer loads his better hand,
His left with tongs turns the vex'd metal round,
And thick, strong strokes, the doubling vaults rebound.

Then first he form'd the immense and solid shield;
Rich various artifice emblazed the field;
Its utmost verge a threefold circle bound;(253)
A silver chain suspends the massy round;
Five ample plates the broad expanse compose,
And godlike labours on the surface rose.
There shone the image of the master-mind:
There earth, there heaven, there ocean he design'd;
The unwearied sun, the moon completely round;
The starry lights that heaven's high convex crown'd;
The Pleiads, Hyads, with the northern team;
And great Orion's more refulgent beam;
To which, around the axle of the sky,
The Bear, revolving, points his golden eye,
Still shines exalted on the ethereal plain,
Nor bathes his blazing forehead in the main.

Two cities radiant on the shield appear,
The image one of peace, and one of war.
Here sacred pomp and genial feast delight,
And solemn dance, and hymeneal rite;
Along the street the new-made brides are led,
With torches flaming, to the nuptial bed:
The youthful dancers in a circle bound
To the soft flute, and cithern's silver sound:
Through the fair streets the matrons in a row
Stand in their porches, and enjoy the show.

There in the forum swarm a numerous train;
The subject of debate, a townsman slain:
One pleads the fine discharged, which one denied,
And bade the public and the laws decide:
The witness is produced on either hand:
For this, or that, the partial people stand:
The appointed heralds still the noisy bands,
And form a ring, with sceptres in their hands:
On seats of stone, within the sacred place,(254)
The reverend elders nodded o'er the case;
Alternate, each the attesting sceptre took,
And rising solemn, each his sentence spoke
Two golden talents lay amidst, in sight,
The prize of him who best adjudged the right.

Another part (a prospect differing far)(255)
Glow'd with refulgent arms, and horrid war.
Two mighty hosts a leaguer'd town embrace,
And one would pillage, one would burn the place.
Meantime the townsmen, arm'd with silent care,
A secret ambush on the foe prepare:
Their wives, their children, and the watchful band
Of trembling parents, on the turrets stand.
They march; by Pallas and by Mars made bold:
Gold were the gods, their radiant garments gold,
And gold their armour: these the squadron led,
August, divine, superior by the head!
A place for ambush fit they found, and stood,
Cover'd with shields, beside a silver flood.
Two spies at distance lurk, and watchful seem
If sheep or oxen seek the winding stream.
Soon the white flocks proceeded o'er the plains,
And steers slow-moving, and two shepherd swains;
Behind them piping on their reeds they go,
Nor fear an ambush, nor suspect a foe.
In arms the glittering squadron rising round
Rush sudden; hills of slaughter heap the ground;
Whole flocks and herds lie bleeding on the plains,
And, all amidst them, dead, the shepherd swains!
The bellowing oxen the besiegers hear;
They rise, take horse, approach, and meet the war,
They fight, they fall, beside the silver flood;
The waving silver seem'd to blush with blood.
There Tumult, there Contention stood confess'd;
One rear'd a dagger at a captive's breast;
One held a living foe, that freshly bled
With new-made wounds; another dragg'd a dead;
Now here, now there, the carcases they tore:
Fate stalk'd amidst them, grim with human gore.
And the whole war came out, and met the eye;
And each bold figure seem'd to live or die.

A field deep furrow'd next the god design'd,(256)
The third time labour'd by the sweating hind;
The shining shares full many ploughmen guide,
And turn their crooked yokes on every side.
Still as at either end they wheel around,
The master meets them with his goblet crown'd;
The hearty draught rewards, renews their toil,
Then back the turning ploughshares cleave the soil:
Behind, the rising earth in ridges roll'd;
And sable look'd, though form'd of molten gold.

Another field rose high with waving grain;
With bended sickles stand the reaper train:
Here stretched in ranks the levell'd swarths are found,
Sheaves heap'd on sheaves here thicken up the ground.
With sweeping stroke the mowers strow the lands;
The gatherers follow, and collect in bands;
And last the children, in whose arms are borne
(Too short to gripe them) the brown sheaves of corn.
The rustic monarch of the field descries,
With silent glee, the heaps around him rise.
A ready banquet on the turf is laid,
Beneath an ample oak's expanded shade.
The victim ox the sturdy youth prepare;
The reaper's due repast, the woman's care.

Next, ripe in yellow gold, a vineyard shines,
Bent with the ponderous harvest of its vines;
A deeper dye the dangling clusters show,
And curl'd on silver props, in order glow:
A darker metal mix'd intrench'd the place;
And pales of glittering tin the inclosure grace.
To this, one pathway gently winding leads,
Where march a train with baskets on their heads,
(Fair maids and blooming youths,) that smiling bear
The purple product of the autumnal year.
To these a youth awakes the warbling strings,
Whose tender lay the fate of Linus sings;
In measured dance behind him move the train,
Tune soft the voice, and answer to the strain.

Here herds of oxen march, erect and bold,
Rear high their horns, and seem to low in gold,
And speed to meadows on whose sounding shores
A rapid torrent through the rushes roars:
Four golden herdsmen as their guardians stand,
And nine sour dogs complete the rustic band.
Two lions rushing from the wood appear'd;
And seized a bull, the master of the herd:
He roar'd: in vain the dogs, the men withstood;
They tore his flesh, and drank his sable blood.
The dogs (oft cheer'd in vain) desert the prey,
Dread the grim terrors, and at distance bay.

Next this, the eye the art of Vulcan leads
Deep through fair forests, and a length of meads,
And stalls, and folds, and scatter'd cots between;
And fleecy flocks, that whiten all the scene.

A figured dance succeeds; such once was seen
In lofty Gnossus for the Cretan queen,
Form'd by Daedalean art; a comely band
Of youths and maidens, bounding hand in hand.
The maids in soft simars of linen dress'd;
The youths all graceful in the glossy vest:
Of those the locks with flowery wreath inroll'd;
Of these the sides adorn'd with swords of gold,
That glittering gay, from silver belts depend.
Now all at once they rise, at once descend,
With well-taught feet: now shape in oblique ways,
Confusedly regular, the moving maze:
Now forth at once, too swift for sight, they spring,
And undistinguish'd blend the flying ring:
So whirls a wheel, in giddy circle toss'd,
And, rapid as it runs, the single spokes are lost.
The gazing multitudes admire around:
Two active tumblers in the centre bound;
Now high, now low, their pliant limbs they bend:
And general songs the sprightly revel end.

Thus the broad shield complete the artist crown'd
With his last hand, and pour'd the ocean round:
In living silver seem'd the waves to roll,
And beat the buckler's verge, and bound the whole.

This done, whate'er a warrior's use requires
He forged; the cuirass that outshone the fires,
The greaves of ductile tin, the helm impress'd
With various sculpture, and the golden crest.
At Thetis' feet the finished labour lay:
She, as a falcon cuts the aerial way,
Swift from Olympus' snowy summit flies,
And bears the blazing present through the skies.(257)





BOOK XIX.


ARGUMENT.

THE RECONCILIATION OF ACHILLES AND AGAMEMNON.

Thetis brings to her son the armour made by Vulcan. She preserves the body
of his friend from corruption, and commands him to assemble the army, to
declare his resentment at an end. Agamemnon and Achilles are solemnly
reconciled: the speeches, presents, and ceremonies on that occasion.
Achilles is with great difficulty persuaded to refrain from the battle
till the troops have refreshed themselves by the advice of Ulysses. The
presents are conveyed to the tent of Achilles, where Briseis laments over
the body of Patroclus. The hero obstinately refuses all repast, and gives
himself up to lamentations for his friend. Minerva descends to strengthen
him, by the order of Jupiter. He arms for the fight: his appearance
described. He addresses himself to his horses, and reproaches them with
the death of Patroclus. One of them is miraculously endued with voice, and
inspired to prophesy his fate: but the hero, not astonished by that
prodigy, rushes with fury to the combat.

The thirteenth day. The scene is on the sea-shore.

Soon as Aurora heaved her Orient head
Above the waves, that blush'd with early red,
(With new-born day to gladden mortal sight,
And gild the courts of heaven with sacred light,)
The immortal arms the goddess-mother bears
Swift to her son: her son she finds in tears
Stretch'd o'er Patroclus' corse; while all the rest
Their sovereign's sorrows in their own express'd.
A ray divine her heavenly presence shed,
And thus, his hand soft touching, Thetis said:

"Suppress, my son, this rage of grief, and know
It was not man, but heaven, that gave the blow;
Behold what arms by Vulcan are bestow'd,
Arms worthy thee, or fit to grace a god."

Then drops the radiant burden on the ground;
Clang the strong arms, and ring the shores around;
Back shrink the Myrmidons with dread surprise,
And from the broad effulgence turn their eyes.
Unmoved the hero kindles at the show,
And feels with rage divine his bosom glow;
From his fierce eyeballs living flames expire,
And flash incessant like a stream of fire:
He turns the radiant gift: and feeds his mind
On all the immortal artist had design'd.

"Goddess! (he cried,) these glorious arms, that shine
With matchless art, confess the hand divine.
Now to the bloody battle let me bend:
But ah! the relics of my slaughter'd friend!
In those wide wounds through which his spirit fled,
Shall flies, and worms obscene, pollute the dead?"

"That unavailing care be laid aside,
(The azure goddess to her son replied,)
Whole years untouch'd, uninjured shall remain,
Fresh as in life, the carcase of the slain.
But go, Achilles, as affairs require,
Before the Grecian peers renounce thine ire:
Then uncontroll'd in boundless war engage,
And heaven with strength supply the mighty rage!"

       [Illustration: THETIS BRINGING THE ARMOUR TO ACHILLES.]

               THETIS BRINGING THE ARMOUR TO ACHILLES.


Then in the nostrils of the slain she pour'd
Nectareous drops, and rich ambrosia shower'd
O'er all the corse. The flies forbid their prey,
Untouch'd it rests, and sacred from decay.
Achilles to the strand obedient went:
The shores resounded with the voice he sent.
The heroes heard, and all the naval train
That tend the ships, or guide them o'er the main,
Alarm'd, transported, at the well-known sound,
Frequent and full, the great assembly crown'd;
Studious to see the terror of the plain,
Long lost to battle, shine in arms again.
Tydides and Ulysses first appear,
Lame with their wounds, and leaning on the spear;
These on the sacred seats of council placed,
The king of men, Atrides, came the last:
He too sore wounded by Agenor's son.
Achilles (rising in the midst) begun:

"O monarch! better far had been the fate
Of thee, of me, of all the Grecian state,
If (ere the day when by mad passion sway'd,
Rash we contended for the black-eyed maid)
Preventing Dian had despatch'd her dart,
And shot the shining mischief to the heart!
Then many a hero had not press'd the shore,
Nor Troy's glad fields been fatten'd with our gore.
Long, long shall Greece the woes we caused bewail,
And sad posterity repeat the tale.
But this, no more the subject of debate,
Is past, forgotten, and resign'd to fate.
Why should, alas, a mortal man, as I,
Burn with a fury that can never die?
Here then my anger ends: let war succeed,
And even as Greece has bled, let Ilion bleed.
Now call the hosts, and try if in our sight
Troy yet shall dare to camp a second night!
I deem, their mightiest, when this arm he knows,
Shall 'scape with transport, and with joy repose."

He said: his finish'd wrath with loud acclaim
The Greeks accept, and shout Pelides' name.
When thus, not rising from his lofty throne,
In state unmoved, the king of men begun:

"Hear me, ye sons of Greece! with silence hear!
And grant your monarch an impartial ear:
Awhile your loud, untimely joy suspend,
And let your rash, injurious clamours end:
Unruly murmurs, or ill-timed applause,
Wrong the best speaker, and the justest cause.
Nor charge on me, ye Greeks, the dire debate:
Know, angry Jove, and all-compelling Fate,
With fell Erinnys, urged my wrath that day
When from Achilles' arms I forced the prey.
What then could I against the will of heaven?
Not by myself, but vengeful Ate driven;
She, Jove's dread daughter, fated to infest
The race of mortals, enter'd in my breast.
Not on the ground that haughty fury treads,
But prints her lofty footsteps on the heads
Of mighty men; inflicting as she goes
Long-festering wounds, inextricable woes!
Of old, she stalk'd amid the bright abodes;
And Jove himself, the sire of men and gods,
The world's great ruler, felt her venom'd dart;
Deceived by Juno's wiles, and female art:
For when Alcmena's nine long months were run,
And Jove expected his immortal son,
To gods and goddesses the unruly joy
He show'd, and vaunted of his matchless boy:
'From us, (he said) this day an infant springs,
Fated to rule, and born a king of kings.'
Saturnia ask'd an oath, to vouch the truth,
And fix dominion on the favour'd youth.
The Thunderer, unsuspicious of the fraud,
Pronounced those solemn words that bind a god.
The joyful goddess, from Olympus' height,
Swift to Achaian Argos bent her flight:
Scarce seven moons gone, lay Sthenelus's wife;
She push'd her lingering infant into life:
Her charms Alcmena's coming labours stay,
And stop the babe, just issuing to the day.
Then bids Saturnius bear his oath in mind;
'A youth (said she) of Jove's immortal kind
Is this day born: from Sthenelus he springs,
And claims thy promise to be king of kings.'
Grief seized the Thunderer, by his oath engaged;
Stung to the soul, he sorrow'd, and he raged.
From his ambrosial head, where perch'd she sate,
He snatch'd the fury-goddess of debate,
The dread, the irrevocable oath he swore,
The immortal seats should ne'er behold her more;
And whirl'd her headlong down, for ever driven
From bright Olympus and the starry heaven:
Thence on the nether world the fury fell;
Ordain'd with man's contentious race to dwell.
Full oft the god his son's hard toils bemoan'd,
Cursed the dire fury, and in secret groan'd.(258)
Even thus, like Jove himself, was I misled,
While raging Hector heap'd our camps with dead.
What can the errors of my rage atone?
My martial troops, my treasures are thy own:
This instant from the navy shall be sent
Whate'er Ulysses promised at thy tent:
But thou! appeased, propitious to our prayer,
Resume thy arms, and shine again in war."

" O king of nations! whose superior sway
(Returns Achilles) all our hosts obey!
To keep or send the presents, be thy care;
To us, 'tis equal: all we ask is war.
While yet we talk, or but an instant shun
The fight, our glorious work remains undone.
Let every Greek, who sees my spear confound
The Trojan ranks, and deal destruction round,
With emulation, what I act survey,
And learn from thence the business of the day.

The son of Peleus thus; and thus replies
The great in councils, Ithacus the wise:
"Though, godlike, thou art by no toils oppress'd,
At least our armies claim repast and rest:
Long and laborious must the combat be,
When by the gods inspired, and led by thee.
Strength is derived from spirits and from blood,
And those augment by generous wine and food:
What boastful son of war, without that stay,
Can last a hero through a single day?
Courage may prompt; but, ebbing out his strength,
Mere unsupported man must yield at length;
Shrunk with dry famine, and with toils declined,
The drooping body will desert the mind:
But built anew with strength-conferring fare,
With limbs and soul untamed, he tires a war.
Dismiss the people, then, and give command.
With strong repast to hearten every band;
But let the presents to Achilles made,
In full assembly of all Greece be laid.
The king of men shall rise in public sight,
And solemn swear (observant of the rite)
That, spotless, as she came, the maid removes,
Pure from his arms, and guiltless of his loves.
That done, a sumptuous banquet shall be made,
And the full price of injured honour paid.
Stretch not henceforth, O prince.! thy sovereign might
Beyond the bounds of reason and of right;
'Tis the chief praise that e'er to kings belong'd,
To right with justice whom with power they wrong'd."

To him the monarch: "Just is thy decree,
Thy words give joy, and wisdom breathes in thee.
Each due atonement gladly I prepare;
And heaven regard me as I justly swear!
Here then awhile let Greece assembled stay,
Nor great Achilles grudge this short delay.
Till from the fleet our presents be convey'd,
And Jove attesting, the firm compact made.
A train of noble youths the charge shall bear;
These to select, Ulysses, be thy care:
In order rank'd let all our gifts appear,
And the fair train of captives close the rear:
Talthybius shall the victim boar convey,
Sacred to Jove, and yon bright orb of day."

"For this (the stern Ćacides replies)
Some less important season may suffice,
When the stern fury of the war is o'er,
And wrath, extinguish'd, burns my breast no more.
By Hector slain, their faces to the sky,
All grim with gaping wounds, our heroes lie:
Those call to war! and might my voice incite,
Now, now, this instant, shall commence the fight:
Then, when the day's complete, let generous bowls,
And copious banquets, glad your weary souls.
Let not my palate know the taste of food,
Till my insatiate rage be cloy'd with blood:
Pale lies my friend, with wounds disfigured o'er,
And his cold feet are pointed to the door.
Revenge is all my soul! no meaner care,
Interest, or thought, has room to harbour there;
Destruction be my feast, and mortal wounds,
And scenes of blood, and agonizing sounds."

"O first of Greeks, (Ulysses thus rejoin'd,)
The best and bravest of the warrior kind!
Thy praise it is in dreadful camps to shine,
But old experience and calm wisdom mine.
Then hear my counsel, and to reason yield,
The bravest soon are satiate of the field;
Though vast the heaps that strow the crimson plain,
The bloody harvest brings but little gain:
The scale of conquest ever wavering lies,
Great Jove but turns it, and the victor dies!
The great, the bold, by thousands daily fall,
And endless were the grief, to weep for all.
Eternal sorrows what avails to shed?
Greece honours not with solemn fasts the dead:
Enough, when death demands the brave, to pay
The tribute of a melancholy day.
One chief with patience to the grave resign'd,
Our care devolves on others left behind.
Let generous food supplies of strength produce,
Let rising spirits flow from sprightly juice,
Let their warm heads with scenes of battle glow,
And pour new furies on the feebler foe.
Yet a short interval, and none shall dare
Expect a second summons to the war;
Who waits for that, the dire effects shall find,
If trembling in the ships he lags behind.
Embodied, to the battle let us bend,
And all at once on haughty Troy descend."

And now the delegates Ulysses sent,
To bear the presents from the royal tent:
The sons of Nestor, Phyleus' valiant heir,
Thias and Merion, thunderbolts of war,
With Lycomedes of Creiontian strain,
And Melanippus, form'd the chosen train.
Swift as the word was given, the youths obey'd:
Twice ten bright vases in the midst they laid;
A row of six fair tripods then succeeds;
And twice the number of high-bounding steeds:
Seven captives next a lovely line compose;
The eighth Briseis, like the blooming rose,
Closed the bright band: great Ithacus, before,
First of the train, the golden talents bore:
The rest in public view the chiefs dispose,
A splendid scene! then Agamemnon rose:
The boar Talthybius held: the Grecian lord
Drew the broad cutlass sheath'd beside his sword:
The stubborn bristles from the victim's brow
He crops, and offering meditates his vow.
His hands uplifted to the attesting skies,
On heaven's broad marble roof were fixed his eyes.
The solemn words a deep attention draw,
And Greece around sat thrill'd with sacred awe.

"Witness thou first! thou greatest power above,
All-good, all-wise, and all-surveying Jove!
And mother-earth, and heaven's revolving light,
And ye, fell furies of the realms of night,
Who rule the dead, and horrid woes prepare
For perjured kings, and all who falsely swear!
The black-eyed maid inviolate removes,
Pure and unconscious of my manly loves.
If this be false, heaven all its vengeance shed,
And levell'd thunder strike my guilty head!"

With that, his weapon deep inflicts the wound;
The bleeding savage tumbles to the ground;
The sacred herald rolls the victim slain
(A feast for fish) into the foaming main.

Then thus Achilles: "Hear, ye Greeks! and know
Whate'er we feel, 'tis Jove inflicts the woe;
Not else Atrides could our rage inflame,
Nor from my arms, unwilling, force the dame.
'Twas Jove's high will alone, o'erruling all,
That doom'd our strife, and doom'd the Greeks to fall.
Go then, ye chiefs! indulge the genial rite;
Achilles waits ye, and expects the fight."

The speedy council at his word adjourn'd:
To their black vessels all the Greeks return'd.
Achilles sought his tent. His train before
March'd onward, bending with the gifts they bore.
Those in the tents the squires industrious spread:
The foaming coursers to the stalls they led;
To their new seats the female captives move
Briseis, radiant as the queen of love,
Slow as she pass'd, beheld with sad survey
Where, gash'd with cruel wounds, Patroclus lay.
Prone on the body fell the heavenly fair,
Beat her sad breast, and tore her golden hair;
All beautiful in grief, her humid eyes
Shining with tears she lifts, and thus she cries:

"Ah, youth for ever dear, for ever kind,
Once tender friend of my distracted mind!
I left thee fresh in life, in beauty gay;
Now find thee cold, inanimated clay!
What woes my wretched race of life attend!
Sorrows on sorrows, never doom'd to end!
The first loved consort of my virgin bed
Before these eyes in fatal battle bled:
My three brave brothers in one mournful day
All trod the dark, irremeable way:
Thy friendly hand uprear'd me from the plain,
And dried my sorrows for a husband slain;
Achilles' care you promised I should prove,
The first, the dearest partner of his love;
That rites divine should ratify the band,
And make me empress in his native land.
Accept these grateful tears! for thee they flow,
For thee, that ever felt another's woe!"

Her sister captives echoed groan for groan,
Nor mourn'd Patroclus' fortunes, but their own.
The leaders press'd the chief on every side;
Unmoved he heard them, and with sighs denied.

"If yet Achilles have a friend, whose care
Is bent to please him, this request forbear;
Till yonder sun descend, ah, let me pay
To grief and anguish one abstemious day."

He spoke, and from the warriors turn'd his face:
Yet still the brother-kings of Atreus' race,
Nestor, Idomeneus, Ulysses sage,
And Phoenix, strive to calm his grief and rage:
His rage they calm not, nor his grief control;
He groans, he raves, he sorrows from his soul.

"Thou too, Patroclus! (thus his heart he vents)
Once spread the inviting banquet in our tents:
Thy sweet society, thy winning care,
Once stay'd Achilles, rushing to the war.
But now, alas! to death's cold arms resign'd,
What banquet but revenge can glad my mind?
What greater sorrow could afflict my breast,
What more if hoary Peleus were deceased?
Who now, perhaps, in Phthia dreads to hear
His son's sad fate, and drops a tender tear.
What more, should Neoptolemus the brave,
My only offspring, sink into the grave?
If yet that offspring lives; (I distant far,
Of all neglectful, wage a hateful war.)
I could not this, this cruel stroke attend;
Fate claim'd Achilles, but might spare his friend.
I hoped Patroclus might survive, to rear
My tender orphan with a parent's care,
From Scyros' isle conduct him o'er the main,
And glad his eyes with his paternal reign,
The lofty palace, and the large domain.
For Peleus breathes no more the vital air;
Or drags a wretched life of age and care,
But till the news of my sad fate invades
His hastening soul, and sinks him to the shades."

Sighing he said: his grief the heroes join'd,
Each stole a tear for what he left behind.
Their mingled grief the sire of heaven survey'd,
And thus with pity to his blue-eyed maid:

"Is then Achilles now no more thy care,
And dost thou thus desert the great in war?
Lo, where yon sails their canvas wings extend,
All comfortless he sits, and wails his friend:
Ere thirst and want his forces have oppress'd,
Haste and infuse ambrosia in his breast."

He spoke; and sudden, at the word of Jove,
Shot the descending goddess from above.
So swift through ether the shrill harpy springs,
The wide air floating to her ample wings,
To great Achilles she her flight address'd,
And pour'd divine ambrosia in his breast,(259)
With nectar sweet, (refection of the gods!)
Then, swift ascending, sought the bright abodes.

Now issued from the ships the warrior-train,
And like a deluge pour'd upon the plain.
As when the piercing blasts of Boreas blow,
And scatter o'er the fields the driving snow;
From dusky clouds the fleecy winter flies,
Whose dazzling lustre whitens all the skies:
So helms succeeding helms, so shields from shields,
Catch the quick beams, and brighten all the fields;
Broad glittering breastplates, spears with pointed rays,
Mix in one stream, reflecting blaze on blaze;
Thick beats the centre as the coursers bound;
With splendour flame the skies, and laugh the fields around,

Full in the midst, high-towering o'er the rest,
His limbs in arms divine Achilles dress'd;
Arms which the father of the fire bestow'd,
Forged on the eternal anvils of the god.
Grief and revenge his furious heart inspire,
His glowing eyeballs roll with living fire;
He grinds his teeth, and furious with delay
O'erlooks the embattled host, and hopes the bloody day.

The silver cuishes first his thighs infold;
Then o'er his breast was braced the hollow gold;
The brazen sword a various baldric tied,
That, starr'd with gems, hung glittering at his side;
And, like the moon, the broad refulgent shield
Blazed with long rays, and gleam'd athwart the field.

So to night-wandering sailors, pale with fears,
Wide o'er the watery waste, a light appears,
Which on the far-seen mountain blazing high,
Streams from some lonely watch-tower to the sky:
With mournful eyes they gaze, and gaze again;
Loud howls the storm, and drives them o'er the main.

Next, his high head the helmet graced; behind
The sweepy crest hung floating in the wind:
Like the red star, that from his flaming hair
Shakes down diseases, pestilence, and war;
So stream'd the golden honours from his head,
Trembled the sparkling plumes, and the loose glories shed.
The chief beholds himself with wondering eyes;
His arms he poises, and his motions tries;
Buoy'd by some inward force, he seems to swim,
And feels a pinion lifting every limb.

And now he shakes his great paternal spear,
Ponderous and huge, which not a Greek could rear,
From Pelion's cloudy top an ash entire
Old Chiron fell'd, and shaped it for his sire;
A spear which stern Achilles only wields,
The death of heroes, and the dread of fields.

Automedon and Alcimus prepare
The immortal coursers, and the radiant car;
(The silver traces sweeping at their side;)
Their fiery mouths resplendent bridles tied;
The ivory-studded reins, return'd behind,
Waved o'er their backs, and to the chariot join'd.
The charioteer then whirl'd the lash around,
And swift ascended at one active bound.
All bright in heavenly arms, above his squire
Achilles mounts, and sets the field on fire;
Not brighter Phoebus in the ethereal way
Flames from his chariot, and restores the day.
High o'er the host, all terrible he stands,
And thunders to his steeds these dread commands:

"Xanthus and Balius! of Podarges' strain,
(Unless ye boast that heavenly race in vain,)
Be swift, be mindful of the load ye bear,
And learn to make your master more your care:
Through falling squadrons bear my slaughtering sword,
Nor, as ye left Patroclus, leave your lord."

The generous Xanthus, as the words he said,
Seem'd sensible of woe, and droop'd his head:
Trembling he stood before the golden wain,
And bow'd to dust the honours of his mane.
When, strange to tell! (so Juno will'd) he broke
Eternal silence, and portentous spoke.
"Achilles! yes! this day at least we bear
Thy rage in safety through the files of war:
But come it will, the fatal time must come,
Not ours the fault, but God decrees thy doom.
Not through our crime, or slowness in the course,
Fell thy Patroclus, but by heavenly force;
The bright far-shooting god who gilds the day
(Confess'd we saw him) tore his arms way.
No--could our swiftness o'er the winds prevail,
Or beat the pinions of the western gale,
All were in vain--the Fates thy death demand,
Due to a mortal and immortal hand."

Then ceased for ever, by the Furies tied,
His fateful voice. The intrepid chief replied
With unabated rage--"So let it be!
Portents and prodigies are lost on me.
I know my fate: to die, to see no more
My much-loved parents, and my native shore--
Enough--when heaven ordains, I sink in night:
Now perish Troy!" He said, and rush'd to fight.

                      [Illustration: HERCULES.]

                              HERCULES.





BOOK XX.


ARGUMENT.

THE BATTLE OF THE GODS, AND THE ACTS OF ACHILLES.

Jupiter, upon Achilles' return to the battle, calls a council of the gods,
and permits them to assist either party. The terrors of the combat
described, when the deities are engaged. Apollo encourages Ćneas to meet
Achilles. After a long conversation, these two heroes encounter; but Ćneas
is preserved by the assistance of Neptune. Achilles falls upon the rest of
the Trojans, and is upon the point of killing Hector, but Apollo conveys
him away in a cloud. Achilles pursues the Trojans with a great slaughter.

The same day continues. The scene is in the field before Troy.

Thus round Pelides breathing war and blood
Greece, sheathed in arms, beside her vessels stood;
While near impending from a neighbouring height,
Troy's black battalions wait the shock of fight.
Then Jove to Themis gives command, to call
The gods to council in the starry hall:
Swift o'er Olympus' hundred hills she flies,
And summons all the senate of the skies.
These shining on, in long procession come
To Jove's eternal adamantine dome.
Not one was absent, not a rural power
That haunts the verdant gloom, or rosy bower;
Each fair-hair'd dryad of the shady wood,
Each azure sister of the silver flood;
All but old Ocean, hoary sire! who keeps
His ancient seat beneath the sacred deeps.
On marble thrones, with lucid columns crown'd,
(The work of Vulcan,) sat the powers around.
Even he whose trident sways the watery reign
Heard the loud summons, and forsook the main,
Assumed his throne amid the bright abodes,
And question'd thus the sire of men and gods:

"What moves the god who heaven and earth commands,
And grasps the thunder in his awful hands,
Thus to convene the whole ethereal state?
Is Greece and Troy the subject in debate?
Already met, the louring hosts appear,
And death stands ardent on the edge of war."

"'Tis true (the cloud-compelling power replies)
This day we call the council of the skies
In care of human race; even Jove's own eye
Sees with regret unhappy mortals die.
Far on Olympus' top in secret state
Ourself will sit, and see the hand of fate
Work out our will. Celestial powers! descend,
And as your minds direct, your succour lend
To either host. Troy soon must lie o'erthrown,
If uncontroll'd Achilles fights alone:
Their troops but lately durst not meet his eyes;
What can they now, if in his rage he rise?
Assist them, gods! or Ilion's sacred wall
May fall this day, though fate forbids the fall."

He said, and fired their heavenly breasts with rage.
On adverse parts the warring gods engage:
Heaven's awful queen; and he whose azure round
Girds the vast globe; the maid in arms renown'd;
Hermes, of profitable arts the sire;
And Vulcan, the black sovereign of the fire:
These to the fleet repair with instant flight;
The vessels tremble as the gods alight.
In aid of Troy, Latona, Phoebus came,
Mars fiery-helm'd, the laughter-loving dame,
Xanthus, whose streams in golden currents flow,
And the chaste huntress of the silver bow.
Ere yet the gods their various aid employ,
Each Argive bosom swell'd with manly joy,
While great Achilles (terror of the plain),
Long lost to battle, shone in arms again.
Dreadful he stood in front of all his host;
Pale Troy beheld, and seem'd already lost;
Her bravest heroes pant with inward fear,
And trembling see another god of war.

But when the powers descending swell'd the fight,
Then tumult rose: fierce rage and pale affright
Varied each face: then Discord sounds alarms,
Earth echoes, and the nations rush to arms.
Now through the trembling shores Minerva calls,
And now she thunders from the Grecian walls.
Mars hovering o'er his Troy, his terror shrouds
In gloomy tempests, and a night of clouds:
Now through each Trojan heart he fury pours
With voice divine, from Ilion's topmost towers:
Now shouts to Simois, from her beauteous hill;
The mountain shook, the rapid stream stood still.

Above, the sire of gods his thunder rolls,
And peals on peals redoubled rend the poles.
Beneath, stern Neptune shakes the solid ground;
The forests wave, the mountains nod around;
Through all their summits tremble Ida's woods,
And from their sources boil her hundred floods.
Troy's turrets totter on the rocking plain,
And the toss'd navies beat the heaving main.
Deep in the dismal regions of the dead,(260)
The infernal monarch rear'd his horrid head,
Leap'd from his throne, lest Neptune's arm should lay
His dark dominions open to the day,
And pour in light on Pluto's drear abodes,
Abhorr'd by men, and dreadful even to gods.(261)

            [Illustration: THE GODS DESCENDING TO BATTLE.]

                    THE GODS DESCENDING TO BATTLE.


Such war the immortals wage; such horrors rend
The world's vast concave, when the gods contend
First silver-shafted Phoebus took the plain
Against blue Neptune, monarch of the main.
The god of arms his giant bulk display'd,
Opposed to Pallas, war's triumphant maid.
Against Latona march'd the son of May.
The quiver'd Dian, sister of the day,
(Her golden arrows sounding at her side,)
Saturnia, majesty of heaven, defied.
With fiery Vulcan last in battle stands
The sacred flood that rolls on golden sands;
Xanthus his name with those of heavenly birth,
But called Scamander by the sons of earth.

While thus the gods in various league engage,
Achilles glow'd with more than mortal rage:
Hector he sought; in search of Hector turn'd
His eyes around, for Hector only burn'd;
And burst like lightning through the ranks, and vow'd
To glut the god of battles with his blood.

Ćneas was the first who dared to stay;
Apollo wedged him in the warrior's way,
But swell'd his bosom with undaunted might,
Half-forced and half-persuaded to the fight.
Like young Lycaon, of the royal line,
In voice and aspect, seem'd the power divine;
And bade the chief reflect, how late with scorn
In distant threats he braved the goddess-born.

Then thus the hero of Anchises' strain:
"To meet Pelides you persuade in vain:
Already have I met, nor void of fear
Observed the fury of his flying spear;
From Ida's woods he chased us to the field,
Our force he scattered, and our herds he kill'd;
Lyrnessus, Pedasus in ashes lay;
But (Jove assisting) I survived the day:
Else had I sunk oppress'd in fatal fight
By fierce Achilles and Minerva's might.
Where'er he moved, the goddess shone before,
And bathed his brazen lance in hostile gore.
What mortal man Achilles can sustain?
The immortals guard him through the dreadful plain,
And suffer not his dart to fall in vain.
Were God my aid, this arm should check his power,
Though strong in battle as a brazen tower."

To whom the son of Jove: "That god implore,
And be what great Achilles was before.
From heavenly Venus thou deriv'st thy strain,
And he but from a sister of the main;
An aged sea-god father of his line;
But Jove himself the sacred source of thine.
Then lift thy weapon for a noble blow,
Nor fear the vaunting of a mortal foe."

This said, and spirit breathed into his breast,
Through the thick troops the embolden'd hero press'd:
His venturous act the white-arm'd queen survey'd,
And thus, assembling all the powers, she said:

"Behold an action, gods! that claims your care,
Lo great Ćneas rushing to the war!
Against Pelides he directs his course,
Phoebus impels, and Phoebus gives him force.
Restrain his bold career; at least, to attend
Our favour'd hero, let some power descend.
To guard his life, and add to his renown,
We, the great armament of heaven, came down.
Hereafter let him fall, as Fates design,
That spun so short his life's illustrious line:(262)
But lest some adverse god now cross his way,
Give him to know what powers assist this day:
For how shall mortal stand the dire alarms,
When heaven's refulgent host appear in arms?"(263)

Thus she; and thus the god whose force can make
The solid globe's eternal basis shake:
"Against the might of man, so feeble known,
Why should celestial powers exert their own?
Suffice from yonder mount to view the scene,
And leave to war the fates of mortal men.
But if the armipotent, or god of light,
Obstruct Achilles, or commence the fight.
Thence on the gods of Troy we swift descend:
Full soon, I doubt not, shall the conflict end;
And these, in ruin and confusion hurl'd,
Yield to our conquering arms the lower world."

Thus having said, the tyrant of the sea,
Coerulean Neptune, rose, and led the way.
Advanced upon the field there stood a mound
Of earth congested, wall'd, and trench'd around;
In elder times to guard Alcides made,
(The work of Trojans, with Minerva's aid,)
What time a vengeful monster of the main
Swept the wide shore, and drove him to the plain.

Here Neptune and the gods of Greece repair,
With clouds encompass'd, and a veil of air:
The adverse powers, around Apollo laid,
Crown the fair hills that silver Simois shade.
In circle close each heavenly party sat,
Intent to form the future scheme of fate;
But mix not yet in fight, though Jove on high
Gives the loud signal, and the heavens reply.

Meanwhile the rushing armies hide the ground;
The trampled centre yields a hollow sound:
Steeds cased in mail, and chiefs in armour bright,
The gleaming champaign glows with brazen light.
Amid both hosts (a dreadful space) appear,
There great Achilles; bold Ćneas, here.
With towering strides Aeneas first advanced;
The nodding plumage on his helmet danced:
Spread o'er his breast the fencing shield he bore,
And, so he moved, his javelin flamed before.
Not so Pelides; furious to engage,
He rush'd impetuous. Such the lion's rage,
Who viewing first his foes with scornful eyes,
Though all in arms the peopled city rise,
Stalks careless on, with unregarding pride;
Till at the length, by some brave youth defied,
To his bold spear the savage turns alone,
He murmurs fury with a hollow groan;
He grins, he foams, he rolls his eyes around
Lash'd by his tail his heaving sides resound;
He calls up all his rage; he grinds his teeth,
Resolved on vengeance, or resolved on death.
So fierce Achilles on Ćneas flies;
So stands Ćneas, and his force defies.
Ere yet the stern encounter join'd, begun
The seed of Thetis thus to Venus' son:

"Why comes Ćneas through the ranks so far?
Seeks he to meet Achilles' arm in war,
In hope the realms of Priam to enjoy,
And prove his merits to the throne of Troy?
Grant that beneath thy lance Achilles dies,
The partial monarch may refuse the prize;
Sons he has many; those thy pride may quell:
And 'tis his fault to love those sons too well,
Or, in reward of thy victorious hand,
Has Troy proposed some spacious tract of land
An ample forest, or a fair domain,
Of hills for vines, and arable for grain?
Even this, perhaps, will hardly prove thy lot.
But can Achilles be so soon forgot?
Once (as I think) you saw this brandish'd spear
And then the great Ćneas seem'd to fear:
With hearty haste from Ida's mount he fled,
Nor, till he reach'd Lyrnessus, turn'd his head.
Her lofty walls not long our progress stay'd;
Those, Pallas, Jove, and we, in ruins laid:
In Grecian chains her captive race were cast;
'Tis true, the great Aeneas fled too fast.
Defrauded of my conquest once before,
What then I lost, the gods this day restore.
Go; while thou may'st, avoid the threaten'd fate;
Fools stay to feel it, and are wise too late."

To this Anchises' son: "Such words employ
To one that fears thee, some unwarlike boy;
Such we disdain; the best may be defied
With mean reproaches, and unmanly pride;
Unworthy the high race from which we came
Proclaim'd so loudly by the voice of fame:
Each from illustrious fathers draws his line;
Each goddess-born; half human, half divine.
Thetis' this day, or Venus' offspring dies,
And tears shall trickle from celestial eyes:
For when two heroes, thus derived, contend,
'Tis not in words the glorious strife can end.
If yet thou further seek to learn my birth
(A tale resounded through the spacious earth)
Hear how the glorious origin we prove
From ancient Dardanus, the first from Jove:
Dardania's walls he raised; for Ilion, then,
(The city since of many-languaged men,)
Was not. The natives were content to till
The shady foot of Ida's fountful hill.(264)
From Dardanus great Erichthonius springs,
The richest, once, of Asia's wealthy kings;
Three thousand mares his spacious pastures bred,
Three thousand foals beside their mothers fed.
Boreas, enamour'd of the sprightly train,
Conceal'd his godhead in a flowing mane,
With voice dissembled to his loves he neigh'd,
And coursed the dappled beauties o'er the mead:
Hence sprung twelve others of unrivall'd kind,
Swift as their mother mares, and father wind.
These lightly skimming, when they swept the plain,
Nor plied the grass, nor bent the tender grain;
And when along the level seas they flew,(265)
Scarce on the surface curl'd the briny dew.
Such Erichthonius was: from him there came
The sacred Tros, of whom the Trojan name.
Three sons renown'd adorn'd his nuptial bed,
Ilus, Assaracus, and Ganymed:
The matchless Ganymed, divinely fair,
Whom heaven, enamour'd, snatch'd to upper air,
To bear the cup of Jove (ethereal guest,
The grace and glory of the ambrosial feast).
The two remaining sons the line divide:
First rose Laomedon from Ilus' side;
From him Tithonus, now in cares grown old,
And Priam, bless'd with Hector, brave and bold;
Clytius and Lampus, ever-honour'd pair;
And Hicetaon, thunderbolt of war.
From great Assaracus sprang Capys, he
Begat Anchises, and Anchises me.
Such is our race: 'tis fortune gives us birth,
But Jove alone endues the soul with worth:
He, source of power and might! with boundless sway,
All human courage gives, or takes away.
Long in the field of words we may contend,
Reproach is infinite, and knows no end,
Arm'd or with truth or falsehood, right or wrong;
So voluble a weapon is the tongue;
Wounded, we wound; and neither side can fail,
For every man has equal strength to rail:
Women alone, when in the streets they jar,
Perhaps excel us in this wordy war;
Like us they stand, encompass'd with the crowd,
And vent their anger impotent and loud.
Cease then--Our business in the field of fight
Is not to question, but to prove our might.
To all those insults thou hast offer'd here,
Receive this answer: 'tis my flying spear."

He spoke. With all his force the javelin flung,
Fix'd deep, and loudly in the buckler rung.
Far on his outstretch'd arm, Pelides held
(To meet the thundering lance) his dreadful shield,
That trembled as it stuck; nor void of fear
Saw, ere it fell, the immeasurable spear.
His fears were vain; impenetrable charms
Secured the temper of the ethereal arms.
Through two strong plates the point its passage held,
But stopp'd, and rested, by the third repell'd.
Five plates of various metal, various mould,
Composed the shield; of brass each outward fold,
Of tin each inward, and the middle gold:
There stuck the lance. Then rising ere he threw,
The forceful spear of great Achilles flew,
And pierced the Dardan shield's extremest bound,
Where the shrill brass return'd a sharper sound:
Through the thin verge the Pelean weapon glides,
And the slight covering of expanded hides.
Ćneas his contracted body bends,
And o'er him high the riven targe extends,
Sees, through its parting plates, the upper air,
And at his back perceives the quivering spear:
A fate so near him, chills his soul with fright;
And swims before his eyes the many-colour'd light.
Achilles, rushing in with dreadful cries,
Draws his broad blade, and at Ćneas flies:
Ćneas rousing as the foe came on,
With force collected, heaves a mighty stone:
A mass enormous! which in modern days
No two of earth's degenerate sons could raise.
But ocean's god, whose earthquakes rock the ground.
Saw the distress, and moved the powers around:

"Lo! on the brink of fate Ćneas stands,
An instant victim to Achilles' hands;
By Phoebus urged; but Phoebus has bestow'd
His aid in vain: the man o'erpowers the god.
And can ye see this righteous chief atone
With guiltless blood for vices not his own?
To all the gods his constant vows were paid;
Sure, though he wars for Troy, he claims our aid.
Fate wills not this; nor thus can Jove resign
The future father of the Dardan line:(266)
The first great ancestor obtain'd his grace,
And still his love descends on all the race:
For Priam now, and Priam's faithless kind,
At length are odious to the all-seeing mind;
On great Ćneas shall devolve the reign,
And sons succeeding sons the lasting line sustain."

The great earth-shaker thus: to whom replies
The imperial goddess with the radiant eyes:
"Good as he is, to immolate or spare
The Dardan prince, O Neptune! be thy care;
Pallas and I, by all that gods can bind,
Have sworn destruction to the Trojan kind;
Not even an instant to protract their fate,
Or save one member of the sinking state;
Till her last flame be quench'd with her last gore,
And even her crumbling ruins are no more."

The king of ocean to the fight descends,
Through all the whistling darts his course he bends,
Swift interposed between the warrior flies,
And casts thick darkness o'er Achilles' eyes.(267)
From great Ćneas' shield the spear he drew,
And at his master's feet the weapon threw.
That done, with force divine he snatch'd on high
The Dardan prince, and bore him through the sky,
Smooth-gliding without step, above the heads
Of warring heroes, and of bounding steeds:
Till at the battle's utmost verge they light,
Where the slow Caucans close the rear of fight.
The godhead there (his heavenly form confess'd)
With words like these the panting chief address'd:

"What power, O prince! with force inferior far,
Urged thee to meet Achilles' arm in war?
Henceforth beware, nor antedate thy doom,
Defrauding fate of all thy fame to come.
But when the day decreed (for come it must)
Shall lay this dreadful hero in the dust,
Let then the furies of that arm be known,
Secure no Grecian force transcends thy own."

With that, he left him wondering as he lay,
Then from Achilles chased the mist away:
Sudden, returning with a stream of light,
The scene of war came rushing on his sight.
Then thus, amazed; "What wonders strike my mind!
My spear, that parted on the wings of wind,
Laid here before me! and the Dardan lord,
That fell this instant, vanish'd from my sword!
I thought alone with mortals to contend,
But powers celestial sure this foe defend.
Great as he is, our arms he scarce will try,
Content for once, with all his gods, to fly.
Now then let others bleed." This said, aloud
He vents his fury and inflames the crowd:
"O Greeks! (he cries, and every rank alarms)
Join battle, man to man, and arms to arms!
'Tis not in me, though favour'd by the sky,
To mow whole troops, and make whole armies fly:
No god can singly such a host engage,
Not Mars himself, nor great Minerva's rage.
But whatsoe'er Achilles can inspire,
Whate'er of active force, or acting fire;
Whate'er this heart can prompt, or hand obey;
All, all Achilles, Greeks! is yours to-day.
Through yon wide host this arm shall scatter fear,
And thin the squadrons with my single spear."

He said: nor less elate with martial joy,
The godlike Hector warm'd the troops of Troy:
"Trojans, to war! Think, Hector leads you on;
Nor dread the vaunts of Peleus' haughty son.
Deeds must decide our fate. E'en these with words
Insult the brave, who tremble at their swords:
The weakest atheist-wretch all heaven defies,
But shrinks and shudders when the thunder flies.
Nor from yon boaster shall your chief retire,
Not though his heart were steel, his hands were fire;
That fire, that steel, your Hector should withstand,
And brave that vengeful heart, that dreadful hand."

Thus (breathing rage through all) the hero said;
A wood of lances rises round his head,
Clamours on clamours tempest all the air,
They join, they throng, they thicken to the war.
But Phoebus warns him from high heaven to shun
The single fight with Thetis' godlike son;
More safe to combat in the mingled band,
Nor tempt too near the terrors of his hand.
He hears, obedient to the god of light,
And, plunged within the ranks, awaits the fight.

Then fierce Achilles, shouting to the skies,
On Troy's whole force with boundless fury flies.
First falls Iphytion, at his army's head;
Brave was the chief, and brave the host he led;
From great Otrynteus he derived his blood,
His mother was a Nais, of the flood;
Beneath the shades of Tmolus, crown'd with snow,
From Hyde's walls he ruled the lands below.
Fierce as he springs, the sword his head divides:
The parted visage falls on equal sides:
With loud-resounding arms he strikes the plain;
While thus Achilles glories o'er the slain:

"Lie there, Otryntides! the Trojan earth
Receives thee dead, though Gygae boast thy birth;
Those beauteous fields where Hyllus' waves are roll'd,
And plenteous Hermus swells with tides of gold,
Are thine no more."--The insulting hero said,
And left him sleeping in eternal shade.
The rolling wheels of Greece the body tore,
And dash'd their axles with no vulgar gore.

Demoleon next, Antenor's offspring, laid
Breathless in dust, the price of rashness paid.
The impatient steel with full-descending sway
Forced through his brazen helm its furious way,
Resistless drove the batter'd skull before,
And dash'd and mingled all the brains with gore.
This sees Hippodamas, and seized with fright,
Deserts his chariot for a swifter flight:
The lance arrests him: an ignoble wound
The panting Trojan rivets to the ground.
He groans away his soul: not louder roars,
At Neptune's shrine on Helice's high shores,
The victim bull; the rocks re-bellow round,
And ocean listens to the grateful sound.
Then fell on Polydore his vengeful rage,(268)
The youngest hope of Priam's stooping age:
(Whose feet for swiftness in the race surpass'd:)
Of all his sons, the dearest, and the last.
To the forbidden field he takes his flight,
In the first folly of a youthful knight,
To vaunt his swiftness wheels around the plain,
But vaunts not long, with all his swiftness slain:
Struck where the crossing belts unite behind,
And golden rings the double back-plate join'd
Forth through the navel burst the thrilling steel;
And on his knees with piercing shrieks he fell;
The rushing entrails pour'd upon the ground
His hands collect; and darkness wraps him round.
When Hector view'd, all ghastly in his gore,
Thus sadly slain the unhappy Polydore,
A cloud of sorrow overcast his sight,
His soul no longer brook'd the distant fight:
Full in Achilles' dreadful front he came,
And shook his javelin like a waving flame.
The son of Peleus sees, with joy possess'd,
His heart high-bounding in his rising breast.
"And, lo! the man on whom black fates attend;
The man, that slew Achilles, is his friend!
No more shall Hector's and Pelides' spear
Turn from each other in the walks of war."--
Then with revengeful eyes he scann'd him o'er:
"Come, and receive thy fate!" He spake no more.

Hector, undaunted, thus: "Such words employ
To one that dreads thee, some unwarlike boy:
Such we could give, defying and defied,
Mean intercourse of obloquy and pride!
I know thy force to mine superior far;
But heaven alone confers success in war:
Mean as I am, the gods may guide my dart,
And give it entrance in a braver heart."

Then parts the lance: but Pallas' heavenly breath
Far from Achilles wafts the winged death:
The bidden dart again to Hector flies,
And at the feet of its great master lies.
Achilles closes with his hated foe,
His heart and eyes with flaming fury glow:
But present to his aid, Apollo shrouds
The favour'd hero in a veil of clouds.
Thrice struck Pelides with indignant heart,
Thrice in impassive air he plunged the dart;
The spear a fourth time buried in the cloud.
He foams with fury, and exclaims aloud:

"Wretch! thou hast 'scaped again; once more thy flight
Has saved thee, and the partial god of light.
But long thou shalt not thy just fate withstand,
If any power assist Achilles' hand.
Fly then inglorious! but thy flight this day
Whole hecatombs of Trojan ghosts shall pay."

With that, he gluts his rage on numbers slain:
Then Dryops tumbled to the ensanguined plain,
Pierced through the neck: he left him panting there,
And stopp'd Demuchus, great Philetor's heir.
Gigantic chief! deep gash'd the enormous blade,
And for the soul an ample passage made.
Laoganus and Dardanus expire,
The valiant sons of an unhappy sire;
Both in one instant from the chariot hurl'd,
Sunk in one instant to the nether world:
This difference only their sad fates afford
That one the spear destroy'd, and one the sword.

Nor less unpitied, young Alastor bleeds;
In vain his youth, in vain his beauty pleads;
In vain he begs thee, with a suppliant's moan,
To spare a form, an age so like thy own!
Unhappy boy! no prayer, no moving art,
E'er bent that fierce, inexorable heart!
While yet he trembled at his knees, and cried,
The ruthless falchion oped his tender side;
The panting liver pours a flood of gore
That drowns his bosom till he pants no more.

Through Mulius' head then drove the impetuous spear:
The warrior falls, transfix'd from ear to ear.
Thy life, Echeclus! next the sword bereaves,
Deep though the front the ponderous falchion cleaves;
Warm'd in the brain the smoking weapon lies,
The purple death comes floating o'er his eyes.
Then brave Deucalion died: the dart was flung
Where the knit nerves the pliant elbow strung;
He dropp'd his arm, an unassisting weight,
And stood all impotent, expecting fate:
Full on his neck the falling falchion sped,
From his broad shoulders hew'd his crested head:
Forth from the bone the spinal marrow flies,
And, sunk in dust, the corpse extended lies.
Rhigmas, whose race from fruitful Thracia came,
(The son of Pierus, an illustrious name,)
Succeeds to fate: the spear his belly rends;
Prone from his car the thundering chief descends.
The squire, who saw expiring on the ground
His prostrate master, rein'd the steeds around;
His back, scarce turn'd, the Pelian javelin gored,
And stretch'd the servant o'er his dying lord.
As when a flame the winding valley fills,
And runs on crackling shrubs between the hills;
Then o'er the stubble up the mountain flies,
Fires the high woods, and blazes to the skies,
This way and that, the spreading torrent roars:
So sweeps the hero through the wasted shores;
Around him wide, immense destruction pours
And earth is deluged with the sanguine showers
As with autumnal harvests cover'd o'er,
And thick bestrewn, lies Ceres' sacred floor;
When round and round, with never-wearied pain,
The trampling steers beat out the unnumber'd grain:
So the fierce coursers, as the chariot rolls,
Tread down whole ranks, and crush out heroes' souls,
Dash'd from their hoofs while o'er the dead they fly,
Black, bloody drops the smoking chariot dye:
The spiky wheels through heaps of carnage tore;
And thick the groaning axles dropp'd with gore.
High o'er the scene of death Achilles stood,
All grim with dust, all horrible in blood:
Yet still insatiate, still with rage on flame;
Such is the lust of never-dying fame!

BOOK XXI.


ARGUMENT.

THE BATTLE IN THE RIVER SCAMANDER.(269)

The Trojans fly before Achilles, some towards the town, others to the
river Scamander: he falls upon the latter with great slaughter: takes
twelve captives alive, to sacrifice to the shade of Patroclus; and kills
Lycaon and Asteropeus. Scamander attacks him with all his waves: Neptune
and Pallas assist the hero: Simois joins Scamander: at length Vulcan, by
the instigation of Juno, almost dries up the river. This Combat ended, the
other gods engage each other. Meanwhile Achilles continues the slaughter,
drives the rest into Troy: Agenor only makes a stand, and is conveyed away
in a cloud by Apollo; who (to delude Achilles) takes upon him Agenor's
shape, and while he pursues him in that disguise, gives the Trojans an
opportunity of retiring into their city.

The same day continues. The scene is on the banks and in the stream of
Scamander.

And now to Xanthus' gliding stream they drove,
Xanthus, immortal progeny of Jove.
The river here divides the flying train,
Part to the town fly diverse o'er the plain,
Where late their troops triumphant bore the fight,
Now chased, and trembling in ignoble flight:
(These with a gathered mist Saturnia shrouds,
And rolls behind the rout a heap of clouds:)
Part plunge into the stream: old Xanthus roars,
The flashing billows beat the whiten'd shores:
With cries promiscuous all the banks resound,
And here, and there, in eddies whirling round,
The flouncing steeds and shrieking warriors drown'd.
As the scorch'd locusts from their fields retire,
While fast behind them runs the blaze of fire;
Driven from the land before the smoky cloud,
The clustering legions rush into the flood:
So, plunged in Xanthus by Achilles' force,
Roars the resounding surge with men and horse.
His bloody lance the hero casts aside,
(Which spreading tamarisks on the margin hide,)
Then, like a god, the rapid billows braves,
Arm'd with his sword, high brandish'd o'er the waves:
Now down he plunges, now he whirls it round,
Deep groan'd the waters with the dying sound;
Repeated wounds the reddening river dyed,
And the warm purple circled on the tide.
Swift through the foamy flood the Trojans fly,
And close in rocks or winding caverns lie:
So the huge dolphin tempesting the main,
In shoals before him fly the scaly train,
Confusedly heap'd they seek their inmost caves,
Or pant and heave beneath the floating waves.
Now, tired with slaughter, from the Trojan band
Twelve chosen youths he drags alive to land;
With their rich belts their captive arms restrains
(Late their proud ornaments, but now their chains).
These his attendants to the ships convey'd,
Sad victims destined to Patroclus' shade;

Then, as once more he plunged amid the flood,
The young Lycaon in his passage stood;
The son of Priam; whom the hero's hand
But late made captive in his father's land
(As from a sycamore, his sounding steel
Lopp'd the green arms to spoke a chariot wheel)
To Lemnos' isle he sold the royal slave,
Where Jason's son the price demanded gave;
But kind Eetion, touching on the shore,
The ransom'd prince to fair Arisbe bore.
Ten days were past, since in his father's reign
He felt the sweets of liberty again;
The next, that god whom men in vain withstand
Gives the same youth to the same conquering hand
Now never to return! and doom'd to go
A sadder journey to the shades below.
His well-known face when great Achilles eyed,
(The helm and visor he had cast aside
With wild affright, and dropp'd upon the field
His useless lance and unavailing shield,)
As trembling, panting, from the stream he fled,
And knock'd his faltering knees, the hero said.
"Ye mighty gods! what wonders strike my view!
Is it in vain our conquering arms subdue?
Sure I shall see yon heaps of Trojans kill'd
Rise from the shades, and brave me on the field;
As now the captive, whom so late I bound
And sold to Lemnos, stalks on Trojan ground!
Not him the sea's unmeasured deeps detain,
That bar such numbers from their native plain;
Lo! he returns. Try, then, my flying spear!
Try, if the grave can hold the wanderer;
If earth, at length this active prince can seize,
Earth, whose strong grasp has held down Hercules."

Thus while he spoke, the Trojan pale with fears
Approach'd, and sought his knees with suppliant tears
Loth as he was to yield his youthful breath,
And his soul shivering at the approach of death.
Achilles raised the spear, prepared to wound;
He kiss'd his feet, extended on the ground:
And while, above, the spear suspended stood,
Longing to dip its thirsty point in blood,
One hand embraced them close, one stopp'd the dart,
While thus these melting words attempt his heart:

"Thy well-known captive, great Achilles! see,
Once more Lycaon trembles at thy knee.
Some pity to a suppliant's name afford,
Who shared the gifts of Ceres at thy board;
Whom late thy conquering arm to Lemnos bore,
Far from his father, friends, and native shore;
A hundred oxen were his price that day,
Now sums immense thy mercy shall repay.
Scarce respited from woes I yet appear,
And scarce twelve morning suns have seen me here;
Lo! Jove again submits me to thy hands,
Again, her victim cruel Fate demands!
I sprang from Priam, and Laothoe fair,
(Old Altes' daughter, and Lelegia's heir;
Who held in Pedasus his famed abode,
And ruled the fields where silver Satnio flow'd,)
Two sons (alas! unhappy sons) she bore;
For ah! one spear shall drink each brother's gore,
And I succeed to slaughter'd Polydore.
How from that arm of terror shall I fly?
Some demon urges! 'tis my doom to die!
If ever yet soft pity touch'd thy mind,
Ah! think not me too much of Hector's kind!
Not the same mother gave thy suppliant breath,
With his, who wrought thy loved Patroclus' death."

These words, attended with a shower of tears,
The youth address'd to unrelenting ears:
"Talk not of life, or ransom (he replies):
Patroclus dead, whoever meets me, dies:
In vain a single Trojan sues for grace;
But least, the sons of Priam's hateful race.
Die then, my friend! what boots it to deplore?
The great, the good Patroclus is no more!
He, far thy better, was foredoom'd to die,
And thou, dost thou bewail mortality?
Seest thou not me, whom nature's gifts adorn,
Sprung from a hero, from a goddess born?
The day shall come (which nothing can avert)
When by the spear, the arrow, or the dart,
By night, or day, by force, or by design,
Impending death and certain fate are mine!
Die then,"--He said; and as the word he spoke,
The fainting stripling sank before the stroke:
His hand forgot its grasp, and left the spear,
While all his trembling frame confess'd his fear:
Sudden, Achilles his broad sword display'd,
And buried in his neck the reeking blade.
Prone fell the youth; and panting on the land,
The gushing purple dyed the thirsty sand.
The victor to the stream the carcase gave,
And thus insults him, floating on the wave:

"Lie there, Lycaon! let the fish surround
Thy bloated corpse, and suck thy gory wound:
There no sad mother shall thy funerals weep,
But swift Scamander roll thee to the deep,
Whose every wave some watery monster brings,
To feast unpunish'd on the fat of kings.
So perish Troy, and all the Trojan line!
Such ruin theirs, and such compassion mine.
What boots ye now Scamander's worshipp'd stream,
His earthly honours, and immortal name?
In vain your immolated bulls are slain,
Your living coursers glut his gulfs in vain!
Thus he rewards you, with this bitter fate;
Thus, till the Grecian vengeance is complete:
Thus is atoned Patroclus' honour'd shade,
And the short absence of Achilles paid."

These boastful words provoked the raging god;
With fury swells the violated flood.
What means divine may yet the power employ
To check Achilles, and to rescue Troy?
Meanwhile the hero springs in arms, to dare
The great Asteropeus to mortal war;
The son of Pelagon, whose lofty line
Flows from the source of Axius, stream divine!
(Fair Peribaea's love the god had crown'd,
With all his refluent waters circled round:)
On him Achilles rush'd; he fearless stood,
And shook two spears, advancing from the flood;
The flood impell'd him, on Pelides' head
To avenge his waters choked with heaps of dead.
Near as they drew, Achilles thus began:

"What art thou, boldest of the race of man?
Who, or from whence? Unhappy is the sire
Whose son encounters our resistless ire."

"O son of Peleus! what avails to trace
(Replied the warrior) our illustrious race?
From rich Paeonia's valleys I command,
Arm'd with protended spears, my native band;
Now shines the tenth bright morning since I came
In aid of Ilion to the fields of fame:
Axius, who swells with all the neighbouring rills,
And wide around the floated region fills,
Begot my sire, whose spear much glory won:
Now lift thy arm, and try that hero's son!"

Threatening he said: the hostile chiefs advance;
At once Asteropeus discharged each lance,
(For both his dexterous hands the lance could wield,)
One struck, but pierced not, the Vulcanian shield;
One razed Achilles' hand; the spouting blood
Spun forth; in earth the fasten'd weapon stood.
Like lightning next the Pelean javelin flies:
Its erring fury hiss'd along the skies;
Deep in the swelling bank was driven the spear,
Even to the middle earth; and quiver'd there.
Then from his side the sword Pelides drew,
And on his foe with double fury flew.
The foe thrice tugg'd, and shook the rooted wood;
Repulsive of his might the weapon stood:
The fourth, he tries to break the spear in vain;
Bent as he stands, he tumbles to the plain;
His belly open'd with a ghastly wound,
The reeking entrails pour upon the ground.
Beneath the hero's feet he panting lies,
And his eye darkens, and his spirit flies;
While the proud victor thus triumphing said,
His radiant armour tearing from the dead:

"So ends thy glory! Such the fate they prove,
Who strive presumptuous with the sons of Jove!
Sprung from a river, didst thou boast thy line?
But great Saturnius is the source of mine.
How durst thou vaunt thy watery progeny?
Of Peleus, Ćacus, and Jove, am I.
The race of these superior far to those,
As he that thunders to the stream that flows.
What rivers can, Scamander might have shown;
But Jove he dreads, nor wars against his son.
Even Achelous might contend in vain,
And all the roaring billows of the main.
The eternal ocean, from whose fountains flow
The seas, the rivers, and the springs below,
The thundering voice of Jove abhors to hear,
And in his deep abysses shakes with fear."

He said: then from the bank his javelin tore,
And left the breathless warrior in his gore.
The floating tides the bloody carcase lave,
And beat against it, wave succeeding wave;
Till, roll'd between the banks, it lies the food
Of curling eels, and fishes of the flood.
All scatter'd round the stream (their mightiest slain)
The amazed Paeonians scour along the plain;
He vents his fury on the flying crew,
Thrasius, Astyplus, and Mnesus slew;
Mydon, Thersilochus, with Ćnius, fell;
And numbers more his lance had plunged to hell,
But from the bottom of his gulfs profound
Scamander spoke; the shores return'd the sound.

"O first of mortals! (for the gods are thine)
In valour matchless, and in force divine!
If Jove have given thee every Trojan head,
'Tis not on me thy rage should heap the dead.
See! my choked streams no more their course can keep,
Nor roll their wonted tribute to the deep.
Turn then, impetuous! from our injured flood;
Content, thy slaughters could amaze a god."

In human form, confess'd before his eyes,
The river thus; and thus the chief replies:
"O sacred stream! thy word we shall obey;
But not till Troy the destined vengeance pay,
Not till within her towers the perjured train
Shall pant, and tremble at our arms again;
Not till proud Hector, guardian of her wall,
Or stain this lance, or see Achilles fall."

He said; and drove with fury on the foe.
Then to the godhead of the silver bow
The yellow flood began: "O son of Jove!
Was not the mandate of the sire above
Full and express, that Phoebus should employ
His sacred arrows in defence of Troy,
And make her conquer, till Hyperion's fall
In awful darkness hide the face of all?"

He spoke in vain--The chief without dismay
Ploughs through the boiling surge his desperate way.
Then rising in his rage above the shores,
From all his deep the bellowing river roars,
Huge heaps of slain disgorges on the coast,
And round the banks the ghastly dead are toss'd.
While all before, the billows ranged on high,
(A watery bulwark,) screen the bands who fly.
Now bursting on his head with thundering sound,
The falling deluge whelms the hero round:
His loaded shield bends to the rushing tide;
His feet, upborne, scarce the strong flood divide,
Sliddering, and staggering. On the border stood
A spreading elm, that overhung the flood;
He seized a bending bough, his steps to stay;
The plant uprooted to his weight gave way.(270)
Heaving the bank, and undermining all;
Loud flash the waters to the rushing fall
Of the thick foliage. The large trunk display'd
Bridged the rough flood across: the hero stay'd
On this his weight, and raised upon his hand,
Leap'd from the channel, and regain'd the land.
Then blacken'd the wild waves: the murmur rose:
The god pursues, a huger billow throws,
And bursts the bank, ambitious to destroy
The man whose fury is the fate of Troy.
He like the warlike eagle speeds his pace
(Swiftest and strongest of the aerial race);
Far as a spear can fly, Achilles springs;
At every bound his clanging armour rings:
Now here, now there, he turns on every side,
And winds his course before the following tide;
The waves flow after, wheresoe'er he wheels,
And gather fast, and murmur at his heels.
So when a peasant to his garden brings
Soft rills of water from the bubbling springs,
And calls the floods from high, to bless his bowers,
And feed with pregnant streams the plants and flowers:
Soon as he clears whate'er their passage stay'd,
And marks the future current with his spade,
Swift o'er the rolling pebbles, down the hills,
Louder and louder purl the falling rills;
Before him scattering, they prevent his pains,
And shine in mazy wanderings o'er the plains.

Still flies Achilles, but before his eyes
Still swift Scamander rolls where'er he flies:
Not all his speed escapes the rapid floods;
The first of men, but not a match for gods.
Oft as he turn'd the torrent to oppose,
And bravely try if all the powers were foes;
So oft the surge, in watery mountains spread,
Beats on his back, or bursts upon his head.
Yet dauntless still the adverse flood he braves,
And still indignant bounds above the waves.
Tired by the tides, his knees relax with toil;
Wash'd from beneath him slides the slimy soil;
When thus (his eyes on heaven's expansion thrown)
Forth bursts the hero with an angry groan:

"Is there no god Achilles to befriend,
No power to avert his miserable end?
Prevent, O Jove! this ignominious date,(271)
And make my future life the sport of fate.
Of all heaven's oracles believed in vain,
But most of Thetis must her son complain;
By Phoebus' darts she prophesied my fall,
In glorious arms before the Trojan wall.
Oh! had I died in fields of battle warm,
Stretch'd like a hero, by a hero's arm!
Might Hector's spear this dauntless bosom rend,
And my swift soul o'ertake my slaughter'd friend.
Ah no! Achilles meets a shameful fate,
Oh how unworthy of the brave and great!
Like some vile swain, whom on a rainy day,
Crossing a ford, the torrent sweeps away,
An unregarded carcase to the sea."

Neptune and Pallas haste to his relief,
And thus in human form address'd the chief:
The power of ocean first: "Forbear thy fear,
O son of Peleus! Lo, thy gods appear!
Behold! from Jove descending to thy aid,
Propitious Neptune, and the blue-eyed maid.
Stay, and the furious flood shall cease to rave
'Tis not thy fate to glut his angry wave.
But thou, the counsel heaven suggests, attend!
Nor breathe from combat, nor thy sword suspend,
Till Troy receive her flying sons, till all
Her routed squadrons pant behind their wall:
Hector alone shall stand his fatal chance,
And Hector's blood shall smoke upon thy lance.
Thine is the glory doom'd." Thus spake the gods:
Then swift ascended to the bright abodes.

Stung with new ardour, thus by heaven impell'd,
He springs impetuous, and invades the field:
O'er all the expanded plain the waters spread;
Heaved on the bounding billows danced the dead,
Floating 'midst scatter'd arms; while casques of gold
And turn'd-up bucklers glitter'd as they roll'd.
High o'er the surging tide, by leaps and bounds,
He wades, and mounts; the parted wave resounds.
Not a whole river stops the hero's course,
While Pallas fills him with immortal force.
With equal rage, indignant Xanthus roars,
And lifts his billows, and o'erwhelms his shores.

Then thus to Simois! "Haste, my brother flood;
And check this mortal that controls a god;
Our bravest heroes else shall quit the fight,
And Ilion tumble from her towery height.
Call then thy subject streams, and bid them roar,
From all thy fountains swell thy watery store,
With broken rocks, and with a load of dead,
Charge the black surge, and pour it on his head.
Mark how resistless through the floods he goes,
And boldly bids the warring gods be foes!
But nor that force, nor form divine to sight,
Shall aught avail him, if our rage unite:
Whelm'd under our dark gulfs those arms shall lie,
That blaze so dreadful in each Trojan eye;
And deep beneath a sandy mountain hurl'd,
Immersed remain this terror of the world.
Such ponderous ruin shall confound the place,
No Greeks shall e'er his perish'd relics grace,
No hand his bones shall gather, or inhume;
These his cold rites, and this his watery tomb."

         [Illustration: ACHILLES CONTENDING WITH THE RIVERS.]

                 ACHILLES CONTENDING WITH THE RIVERS.


He said; and on the chief descends amain,
Increased with gore, and swelling with the slain.
Then, murmuring from his beds, he boils, he raves,
And a foam whitens on the purple waves:
At every step, before Achilles stood
The crimson surge, and deluged him with blood.
Fear touch'd the queen of heaven: she saw dismay'd,
She call'd aloud, and summon'd Vulcan's aid.

"Rise to the war! the insulting flood requires
Thy wasteful arm! assemble all thy fires!
While to their aid, by our command enjoin'd,
Rush the swift eastern and the western wind:
These from old ocean at my word shall blow,
Pour the red torrent on the watery foe,
Corses and arms to one bright ruin turn,
And hissing rivers to their bottoms burn.
Go, mighty in thy rage! display thy power,
Drink the whole flood, the crackling trees devour.
Scorch all the banks! and (till our voice reclaim)
Exert the unwearied furies of the flame!"

The power ignipotent her word obeys:
Wide o'er the plain he pours the boundless blaze;
At once consumes the dead, and dries the soil
And the shrunk waters in their channel boil.
As when autumnal Boreas sweeps the sky,
And instant blows the water'd gardens dry:
So look'd the field, so whiten'd was the ground,
While Vulcan breathed the fiery blast around.
Swift on the sedgy reeds the ruin preys;
Along the margin winds the running blaze:
The trees in flaming rows to ashes turn,
The flowering lotos and the tamarisk burn,
Broad elm, and cypress rising in a spire;
The watery willows hiss before the fire.
Now glow the waves, the fishes pant for breath,
The eels lie twisting in the pangs of death:
Now flounce aloft, now dive the scaly fry,
Or, gasping, turn their bellies to the sky.
At length the river rear'd his languid head,
And thus, short-panting, to the god he said:

"Oh Vulcan! oh! what power resists thy might?
I faint, I sink, unequal to the fight--
I yield--Let Ilion fall; if fate decree--
Ah--bend no more thy fiery arms on me!"

He ceased; wide conflagration blazing round;
The bubbling waters yield a hissing sound.
As when the flames beneath a cauldron rise,(272)
To melt the fat of some rich sacrifice,
Amid the fierce embrace of circling fires
The waters foam, the heavy smoke aspires:
So boils the imprison'd flood, forbid to flow,
And choked with vapours feels his bottom glow.
To Juno then, imperial queen of air,
The burning river sends his earnest prayer:

"Ah why, Saturnia; must thy son engage
Me, only me, with all his wasteful rage?
On other gods his dreadful arm employ,
For mightier gods assert the cause of Troy.
Submissive I desist, if thou command;
But ah! withdraw this all-destroying hand.
Hear then my solemn oath, to yield to fate
Unaided Ilion, and her destined state,
Till Greece shall gird her with destructive flame,
And in one ruin sink the Trojan name."

His warm entreaty touch'd Saturnia's ear:
She bade the ignipotent his rage forbear,
Recall the flame, nor in a mortal cause
Infest a god: the obedient flame withdraws:
Again the branching streams begin to spread,
And soft remurmur in their wonted bed.

While these by Juno's will the strife resign,
The warring gods in fierce contention join:
Rekindling rage each heavenly breast alarms:
With horrid clangour shock the ethereal arms:
Heaven in loud thunder bids the trumpet sound;
And wide beneath them groans the rending ground.
Jove, as his sport, the dreadful scene descries,
And views contending gods with careless eyes.
The power of battles lifts his brazen spear,
And first assaults the radiant queen of war:

"What moved thy madness, thus to disunite
Ethereal minds, and mix all heaven in fight?
What wonder this, when in thy frantic mood
Thou drovest a mortal to insult a god?
Thy impious hand Tydides' javelin bore,
And madly bathed it in celestial gore."

He spoke, and smote the long-resounding shield,
Which bears Jove's thunder on its dreadful field:
The adamantine aegis of her sire,
That turns the glancing bolt and forked fire.

Then heaved the goddess in her mighty hand
A stone, the limit of the neighbouring land,
There fix'd from eldest times; black, craggy, vast;
This at the heavenly homicide she cast.
Thundering he falls, a mass of monstrous size:
And seven broad acres covers as he lies.
The stunning stroke his stubborn nerves unbound:
Loud o'er the fields his ringing arms resound:
The scornful dame her conquest views with smiles,
And, glorying, thus the prostrate god reviles:

"Hast thou not yet, insatiate fury! known
How far Minerva's force transcends thy own?
Juno, whom thou rebellious darest withstand,
Corrects thy folly thus by Pallas' hand;
Thus meets thy broken faith with just disgrace,
And partial aid to Troy's perfidious race."

The goddess spoke, and turn'd her eyes away,
That, beaming round, diffused celestial day.
Jove's Cyprian daughter, stooping on the land,
Lent to the wounded god her tender hand:
Slowly he rises, scarcely breathes with pain,
And, propp'd on her fair arm, forsakes the plain.
This the bright empress of the heavens survey'd,
And, scoffing, thus to war's victorious maid:

"Lo! what an aid on Mars's side is seen!
The smiles' and loves' unconquerable queen!
Mark with what insolence, in open view,
She moves: let Pallas, if she dares, pursue."

Minerva smiling heard, the pair o'ertook,
And slightly on her breast the wanton strook:
She, unresisting, fell (her spirits fled);
On earth together lay the lovers spread.
"And like these heroes be the fate of all
(Minerva cries) who guard the Trojan wall!
To Grecian gods such let the Phrygian be,
So dread, so fierce, as Venus is to me;
Then from the lowest stone shall Troy be moved."
Thus she, and Juno with a smile approved.

Meantime, to mix in more than mortal fight,
The god of ocean dares the god of light.
"What sloth has seized us, when the fields around
Ring with conflicting powers, and heaven returns the sound:
Shall, ignominious, we with shame retire,
No deed perform'd, to our Olympian sire?
Come, prove thy arm! for first the war to wage,
Suits not my greatness, or superior age:
Rash as thou art to prop the Trojan throne,
(Forgetful of my wrongs, and of thy own,)
And guard the race of proud Laomedon!
Hast thou forgot, how, at the monarch's prayer,
We shared the lengthen'd labours of a year?
Troy walls I raised (for such were Jove's commands),
And yon proud bulwarks grew beneath my hands:
Thy task it was to feed the bellowing droves
Along fair Ida's vales and pendant groves.
But when the circling seasons in their train
Brought back the grateful day that crown'd our pain,
With menace stern the fraudful king defied
Our latent godhead, and the prize denied:
Mad as he was, he threaten'd servile bands,
And doom'd us exiles far in barbarous lands.(273)
Incensed, we heavenward fled with swiftest wing,
And destined vengeance on the perjured king.
Dost thou, for this, afford proud Ilion grace,
And not, like us, infest the faithless race;
Like us, their present, future sons destroy,
And from its deep foundations heave their Troy?"

Apollo thus: "To combat for mankind
Ill suits the wisdom of celestial mind;
For what is man? Calamitous by birth,
They owe their life and nourishment to earth;
Like yearly leaves, that now, with beauty crown'd,
Smile on the sun; now, wither on the ground.
To their own hands commit the frantic scene,
Nor mix immortals in a cause so mean."

Then turns his face, far-beaming heavenly fires,
And from the senior power submiss retires:
Him thus retreating, Artemis upbraids,
The quiver'd huntress of the sylvan shades:

"And is it thus the youthful Phoebus flies,
And yields to ocean's hoary sire the prize?
How vain that martial pomp, and dreadful show
Of pointed arrows and the silver bow!
Now boast no more in yon celestial bower,
Thy force can match the great earth-shaking power."

Silent he heard the queen of woods upbraid:
Not so Saturnia bore the vaunting maid:
But furious thus: "What insolence has driven
Thy pride to face the majesty of heaven?
What though by Jove the female plague design'd,
Fierce to the feeble race of womankind,
The wretched matron feels thy piercing dart;
Thy sex's tyrant, with a tiger's heart?
What though tremendous in the woodland chase
Thy certain arrows pierce the savage race?
How dares thy rashness on the powers divine
Employ those arms, or match thy force with mine?
Learn hence, no more unequal war to wage--"
She said, and seized her wrists with eager rage;
These in her left hand lock'd, her right untied
The bow, the quiver, and its plumy pride.
About her temples flies the busy bow;
Now here, now there, she winds her from the blow;
The scattering arrows, rattling from the case,
Drop round, and idly mark the dusty place.
Swift from the field the baffled huntress flies,
And scarce restrains the torrent in her eyes:
So, when the falcon wings her way above,
To the cleft cavern speeds the gentle dove;
(Not fated yet to die;) there safe retreats,
Yet still her heart against the marble beats.

To her Latona hastes with tender care;
Whom Hermes viewing, thus declines the war:
"How shall I face the dame, who gives delight
To him whose thunders blacken heaven with night?
Go, matchless goddess! triumph in the skies,
And boast my conquest, while I yield the prize."

He spoke; and pass'd: Latona, stooping low,
Collects the scatter'd shafts and fallen bow,
That, glittering on the dust, lay here and there
Dishonour'd relics of Diana's war:
Then swift pursued her to her blest abode,
Where, all confused, she sought the sovereign god;
Weeping, she grasp'd his knees: the ambrosial vest
Shook with her sighs, and panted on her breast.

The sire superior smiled, and bade her show
What heavenly hand had caused his daughter's woe?
Abash'd, she names his own imperial spouse;
And the pale crescent fades upon her brows.

Thus they above: while, swiftly gliding down,
Apollo enters Ilion's sacred town;
The guardian-god now trembled for her wall,
And fear'd the Greeks, though fate forbade her fall.
Back to Olympus, from the war's alarms,
Return the shining bands of gods in arms;
Some proud in triumph, some with rage on fire;
And take their thrones around the ethereal sire.

Through blood, through death, Achilles still proceeds,
O'er slaughter'd heroes, and o'er rolling steeds.
As when avenging flames with fury driven
On guilty towns exert the wrath of heaven;
The pale inhabitants, some fall, some fly;
And the red vapours purple all the sky:
So raged Achilles: death and dire dismay,
And toils, and terrors, fill'd the dreadful day.

High on a turret hoary Priam stands,
And marks the waste of his destructive hands;
Views, from his arm, the Trojans' scatter'd flight,
And the near hero rising on his sight!
No stop, no check, no aid! With feeble pace,
And settled sorrow on his aged face,
Fast as he could, he sighing quits the walls;
And thus descending, on the guards he calls:

"You to whose care our city-gates belong,
Set wide your portals to the flying throng:
For lo! he comes, with unresisted sway;
He comes, and desolation marks his way!
But when within the walls our troops take breath,
Lock fast the brazen bars, and shut out death."
Thus charged the reverend monarch: wide were flung
The opening folds; the sounding hinges rung.
Phoebus rush'd forth, the flying bands to meet;
Struck slaughter back, and cover'd the retreat,
On heaps the Trojans crowd to gain the gate,
And gladsome see their last escape from fate.
Thither, all parch'd with thirst, a heartless train,
Hoary with dust, they beat the hollow plain:
And gasping, panting, fainting, labour on
With heavier strides, that lengthen toward the town.
Enraged Achilles follows with his spear;
Wild with revenge, insatiable of war.

Then had the Greeks eternal praise acquired,
And Troy inglorious to her walls retired;
But he, the god who darts ethereal flame,
Shot down to save her, and redeem her fame:
To young Agenor force divine he gave;
(Antenor's offspring, haughty, bold, and brave;)
In aid of him, beside the beech he sate,
And wrapt in clouds, restrain'd the hand of fate.
When now the generous youth Achilles spies.
Thick beats his heart, the troubled motions rise.
(So, ere a storm, the waters heave and roll.)
He stops, and questions thus his mighty soul;

"What, shall I fly this terror of the plain!
Like others fly, and be like others slain?
Vain hope! to shun him by the self-same road
Yon line of slaughter'd Trojans lately trod.
No: with the common heap I scorn to fall--
What if they pass'd me to the Trojan wall,
While I decline to yonder path, that leads
To Ida's forests and surrounding shades?
So may I reach, conceal'd, the cooling flood,
From my tired body wash the dirt and blood,
As soon as night her dusky veil extends,
Return in safety to my Trojan friends.
What if?--But wherefore all this vain debate?
Stand I to doubt, within the reach of fate?
Even now perhaps, ere yet I turn the wall,
The fierce Achilles sees me, and I fall:
Such is his swiftness, 'tis in vain to fly,
And such his valour, that who stands must die.
Howe'er 'tis better, fighting for the state,
Here, and in public view, to meet my fate.
Yet sure he too is mortal; he may feel
(Like all the sons of earth) the force of steel.
One only soul informs that dreadful frame:
And Jove's sole favour gives him all his fame."

He said, and stood, collected, in his might;
And all his beating bosom claim'd the fight.
So from some deep-grown wood a panther starts,
Roused from his thicket by a storm of darts:
Untaught to fear or fly, he hears the sounds
Of shouting hunters, and of clamorous hounds;
Though struck, though wounded, scarce perceives the pain;
And the barb'd javelin stings his breast in vain:
On their whole war, untamed, the savage flies;
And tears his hunter, or beneath him dies.
Not less resolved, Antenor's valiant heir
Confronts Achilles, and awaits the war,
Disdainful of retreat: high held before,
His shield (a broad circumference) he bore;
Then graceful as he stood, in act to throw
The lifted javelin, thus bespoke the foe:

"How proud Achilles glories in his fame!
And hopes this day to sink the Trojan name
Beneath her ruins! Know, that hope is vain;
A thousand woes, a thousand toils remain.
Parents and children our just arms employ,
And strong and many are the sons of Troy.
Great as thou art, even thou may'st stain with gore
These Phrygian fields, and press a foreign shore."

He said: with matchless force the javelin flung
Smote on his knee; the hollow cuishes rung
Beneath the pointed steel; but safe from harms
He stands impassive in the ethereal arms.
Then fiercely rushing on the daring foe,
His lifted arm prepares the fatal blow:
But, jealous of his fame, Apollo shrouds
The god-like Trojan in a veil of clouds.
Safe from pursuit, and shut from mortal view,
Dismiss'd with fame, the favoured youth withdrew.
Meanwhile the god, to cover their escape,
Assumes Agenor's habit, voice and shape,
Flies from the furious chief in this disguise;
The furious chief still follows where he flies.
Now o'er the fields they stretch with lengthen'd strides,
Now urge the course where swift Scamander glides:
The god, now distant scarce a stride before,
Tempts his pursuit, and wheels about the shore;
While all the flying troops their speed employ,
And pour on heaps into the walls of Troy:
No stop, no stay; no thought to ask, or tell,
Who 'scaped by flight, or who by battle fell.
'Twas tumult all, and violence of flight;
And sudden joy confused, and mix'd affright.
Pale Troy against Achilles shuts her gate:
And nations breathe, deliver'd from their fate.





BOOK XXII.


ARGUMENT.

THE DEATH OF HECTOR.

The Trojans being safe within the walls, Hector only stays to oppose
Achilles. Priam is struck at his approach, and tries to persuade his son
to re-enter the town. Hecuba joins her entreaties, but in vain. Hector
consults within himself what measures to take; but at the advance of
Achilles, his resolution fails him, and he flies. Achilles pursues him
thrice round the walls of Troy. The gods debate concerning the fate of
Hector; at length Minerva descends to the aid of Achilles. She deludes
Hector in the shape of Deiphobus; he stands the combat, and is slain.
Achilles drags the dead body at his chariot in the sight of Priam and
Hecuba. Their lamentations, tears, and despair. Their cries reach the ears
of Andromache, who, ignorant of this, was retired into the inner part of
the palace: she mounts up to the walls, and beholds her dead husband. She
swoons at the spectacle. Her excess of grief and lamentation.

The thirtieth day still continues. The scene lies under the walls, and on
the battlements of Troy.

Thus to their bulwarks, smit with panic fear,
The herded Ilians rush like driven deer:
There safe they wipe the briny drops away,
And drown in bowls the labours of the day.
Close to the walls, advancing o'er the fields
Beneath one roof of well-compacted shields,
March, bending on, the Greeks' embodied powers,
Far stretching in the shade of Trojan towers.
Great Hector singly stay'd: chain'd down by fate
There fix'd he stood before the Scaean gate;
Still his bold arms determined to employ,
The guardian still of long-defended Troy.

Apollo now to tired Achilles turns:
(The power confess'd in all his glory burns:)
"And what (he cries) has Peleus' son in view,
With mortal speed a godhead to pursue?
For not to thee to know the gods is given,
Unskill'd to trace the latent marks of heaven.
What boots thee now, that Troy forsook the plain?
Vain thy past labour, and thy present vain:
Safe in their walls are now her troops bestow'd,
While here thy frantic rage attacks a god."

The chief incensed--"Too partial god of day!
To check my conquests in the middle way:
How few in Ilion else had refuge found!
What gasping numbers now had bit the ground!
Thou robb'st me of a glory justly mine,
Powerful of godhead, and of fraud divine:
Mean fame, alas! for one of heavenly strain,
To cheat a mortal who repines in vain."

Then to the city, terrible and strong,
With high and haughty steps he tower'd along,
So the proud courser, victor of the prize,
To the near goal with double ardour flies.
Him, as he blazing shot across the field,
The careful eyes of Priam first beheld.
Not half so dreadful rises to the sight,(274)
Through the thick gloom of some tempestuous night,
Orion's dog (the year when autumn weighs),
And o'er the feebler stars exerts his rays;
Terrific glory! for his burning breath
Taints the red air with fevers, plagues, and death.
So flamed his fiery mail. Then wept the sage:
He strikes his reverend head, now white with age;
He lifts his wither'd arms; obtests the skies;
He calls his much-loved son with feeble cries:
The son, resolved Achilles' force to dare,
Full at the Scaean gates expects the war;
While the sad father on the rampart stands,
And thus adjures him with extended hands:

"Ah stay not, stay not! guardless and alone;
Hector! my loved, my dearest, bravest son!
Methinks already I behold thee slain,
And stretch'd beneath that fury of the plain.
Implacable Achilles! might'st thou be
To all the gods no dearer than to me!
Thee, vultures wild should scatter round the shore.
And bloody dogs grow fiercer from thy gore.
How many valiant sons I late enjoy'd,
Valiant in vain! by thy cursed arm destroy'd:
Or, worse than slaughtered, sold in distant isles
To shameful bondage, and unworthy toils.
Two, while I speak, my eyes in vain explore,
Two from one mother sprung, my Polydore,
And loved Lycaon; now perhaps no more!
Oh! if in yonder hostile camp they live,
What heaps of gold, what treasures would I give!
(Their grandsire's wealth, by right of birth their own,
Consign'd his daughter with Lelegia's throne:)
But if (which Heaven forbid) already lost,
All pale they wander on the Stygian coast;
What sorrows then must their sad mother know,
What anguish I? unutterable woe!
Yet less that anguish, less to her, to me,
Less to all Troy, if not deprived of thee.
Yet shun Achilles! enter yet the wall;
And spare thyself, thy father, spare us all!
Save thy dear life; or, if a soul so brave
Neglect that thought, thy dearer glory save.
Pity, while yet I live, these silver hairs;
While yet thy father feels the woes he bears,
Yet cursed with sense! a wretch, whom in his rage
(All trembling on the verge of helpless age)
Great Jove has placed, sad spectacle of pain!
The bitter dregs of fortune's cup to drain:
To fill with scenes of death his closing eyes,
And number all his days by miseries!
My heroes slain, my bridal bed o'erturn'd,
My daughters ravish'd, and my city burn'd,
My bleeding infants dash'd against the floor;
These I have yet to see, perhaps yet more!
Perhaps even I, reserved by angry fate,
The last sad relic of my ruin'd state,
(Dire pomp of sovereign wretchedness!) must fall,
And stain the pavement of my regal hall;
Where famish'd dogs, late guardians of my door,
Shall lick their mangled master's spatter'd gore.
Yet for my sons I thank ye, gods! 'tis well;
Well have they perish'd, for in fight they fell.
Who dies in youth and vigour, dies the best,
Struck through with wounds, all honest on the breast.
But when the fates, in fulness of their rage,
Spurn the hoar head of unresisting age,
In dust the reverend lineaments deform,
And pour to dogs the life-blood scarcely warm:
This, this is misery! the last, the worse,
That man can feel! man, fated to be cursed!"

He said, and acting what no words could say,
Rent from his head the silver locks away.
With him the mournful mother bears a part;
Yet all her sorrows turn not Hector's heart.
The zone unbraced, her bosom she display'd;
And thus, fast-falling the salt tears, she said:

"Have mercy on me, O my son! revere
The words of age; attend a parent's prayer!
If ever thee in these fond arms I press'd,
Or still'd thy infant clamours at this breast;
Ah do not thus our helpless years forego,
But, by our walls secured, repel the foe.
Against his rage if singly thou proceed,
Should'st thou, (but Heaven avert it!) should'st thou bleed,
Nor must thy corse lie honour'd on the bier,
Nor spouse, nor mother, grace thee with a tear!
Far from our pious rites those dear remains
Must feast the vultures on the naked plains."

So they, while down their cheeks the torrents roll;
But fix'd remains the purpose of his soul;
Resolved he stands, and with a fiery glance
Expects the hero's terrible advance.
So, roll'd up in his den, the swelling snake
Beholds the traveller approach the brake;
When fed with noxious herbs his turgid veins
Have gather'd half the poisons of the plains;
He burns, he stiffens with collected ire,
And his red eyeballs glare with living fire.
Beneath a turret, on his shield reclined,
He stood, and question'd thus his mighty mind:(275)

"Where lies my way? to enter in the wall?
Honour and shame the ungenerous thought recall:
Shall proud Polydamas before the gate
Proclaim, his counsels are obey'd too late,
Which timely follow'd but the former night,
What numbers had been saved by Hector's flight?
That wise advice rejected with disdain,
I feel my folly in my people slain.
Methinks my suffering country's voice I hear,
But most her worthless sons insult my ear,
On my rash courage charge the chance of war,
And blame those virtues which they cannot share.
No--if I e'er return, return I must
Glorious, my country's terror laid in dust:
Or if I perish, let her see me fall
In field at least, and fighting for her wall.
And yet suppose these measures I forego,
Approach unarm'd, and parley with the foe,
The warrior-shield, the helm, and lance, lay down.
And treat on terms of peace to save the town:
The wife withheld, the treasure ill-detain'd
(Cause of the war, and grievance of the land)
With honourable justice to restore:
And add half Ilion's yet remaining store,
Which Troy shall, sworn, produce; that injured Greece
May share our wealth, and leave our walls in peace.
But why this thought? Unarm'd if I should go,
What hope of mercy from this vengeful foe,
But woman-like to fall, and fall without a blow?
We greet not here, as man conversing man,
Met at an oak, or journeying o'er a plain;
No season now for calm familiar talk,
Like youths and maidens in an evening walk:
War is our business, but to whom is given
To die, or triumph, that, determine Heaven!"

Thus pondering, like a god the Greek drew nigh;
His dreadful plumage nodded from on high;
The Pelian javelin, in his better hand,
Shot trembling rays that glitter'd o'er the land;
And on his breast the beamy splendour shone,
Like Jove's own lightning, or the rising sun.
As Hector sees, unusual terrors rise,
Struck by some god, he fears, recedes, and flies.
He leaves the gates, he leaves the wall behind:
Achilles follows like the winged wind.
Thus at the panting dove a falcon flies
(The swiftest racer of the liquid skies),
Just when he holds, or thinks he holds his prey,
Obliquely wheeling through the aerial way,
With open beak and shrilling cries he springs,
And aims his claws, and shoots upon his wings:
No less fore-right the rapid chase they held,
One urged by fury, one by fear impell'd:
Now circling round the walls their course maintain,
Where the high watch-tower overlooks the plain;
Now where the fig-trees spread their umbrage broad,
(A wider compass,) smoke along the road.
Next by Scamander's double source they bound,
Where two famed fountains burst the parted ground;
This hot through scorching clefts is seen to rise,
With exhalations steaming to the skies;
That the green banks in summer's heat o'erflows,
Like crystal clear, and cold as winter snows:
Each gushing fount a marble cistern fills,
Whose polish'd bed receives the falling rills;
Where Trojan dames (ere yet alarm'd by Greece)
Wash'd their fair garments in the days of peace.(276)
By these they pass'd, one chasing, one in flight:
(The mighty fled, pursued by stronger might:)
Swift was the course; no vulgar prize they play,
No vulgar victim must reward the day:
(Such as in races crown the speedy strife:)
The prize contended was great Hector's life.
As when some hero's funerals are decreed
In grateful honour of the mighty dead;
Where high rewards the vigorous youth inflame
(Some golden tripod, or some lovely dame)
The panting coursers swiftly turn the goal,
And with them turns the raised spectator's soul:
Thus three times round the Trojan wall they fly.
The gazing gods lean forward from the sky;
To whom, while eager on the chase they look,
The sire of mortals and immortals spoke:

"Unworthy sight! the man beloved of heaven,
Behold, inglorious round yon city driven!
My heart partakes the generous Hector's pain;
Hector, whose zeal whole hecatombs has slain,
Whose grateful fumes the gods received with joy,
From Ida's summits, and the towers of Troy:
Now see him flying; to his fears resign'd,
And fate, and fierce Achilles, close behind.
Consult, ye powers! ('tis worthy your debate)
Whether to snatch him from impending fate,
Or let him bear, by stern Pelides slain,
(Good as he is) the lot imposed on man."

Then Pallas thus: "Shall he whose vengeance forms
The forky bolt, and blackens heaven with storms,
Shall he prolong one Trojan's forfeit breath?
A man, a mortal, pre-ordain'd to death!
And will no murmurs fill the courts above?
No gods indignant blame their partial Jove?"

"Go then (return'd the sire) without delay,
Exert thy will: I give the Fates their way.
Swift at the mandate pleased Tritonia flies,
And stoops impetuous from the cleaving skies.

As through the forest, o'er the vale and lawn,
The well-breath'd beagle drives the flying fawn,
In vain he tries the covert of the brakes,
Or deep beneath the trembling thicket shakes;
Sure of the vapour in the tainted dews,
The certain hound his various maze pursues.
Thus step by step, where'er the Trojan wheel'd,
There swift Achilles compass'd round the field.
Oft as to reach the Dardan gates he bends,
And hopes the assistance of his pitying friends,
(Whose showering arrows, as he coursed below,
From the high turrets might oppress the foe,)
So oft Achilles turns him to the plain:
He eyes the city, but he eyes in vain.
As men in slumbers seem with speedy pace,
One to pursue, and one to lead the chase,
Their sinking limbs the fancied course forsake,
Nor this can fly, nor that can overtake:
No less the labouring heroes pant and strain:
While that but flies, and this pursues in vain.

What god, O muse, assisted Hector's force
With fate itself so long to hold the course?
Phoebus it was; who, in his latest hour,
Endued his knees with strength, his nerves with power:
And great Achilles, lest some Greek's advance
Should snatch the glory from his lifted lance,
Sign'd to the troops to yield his foe the way,
And leave untouch'd the honours of the day.

Jove lifts the golden balances, that show
The fates of mortal men, and things below:
Here each contending hero's lot he tries,
And weighs, with equal hand, their destinies.
Low sinks the scale surcharged with Hector's fate;
Heavy with death it sinks, and hell receives the weight.

Then Phoebus left him. Fierce Minerva flies
To stern Pelides, and triumphing, cries:
"O loved of Jove! this day our labours cease,
And conquest blazes with full beams on Greece.
Great Hector falls; that Hector famed so far,
Drunk with renown, insatiable of war,
Falls by thy hand, and mine! nor force, nor flight,
Shall more avail him, nor his god of light.
See, where in vain he supplicates above,
Roll'd at the feet of unrelenting Jove;
Rest here: myself will lead the Trojan on,
And urge to meet the fate he cannot shun."

Her voice divine the chief with joyful mind
Obey'd; and rested, on his lance reclined
While like Deiphobus the martial dame
(Her face, her gesture, and her arms the same),
In show an aid, by hapless Hector's side
Approach'd, and greets him thus with voice belied:

"Too long, O Hector! have I borne the sight
Of this distress, and sorrow'd in thy flight:
It fits us now a noble stand to make,
And here, as brothers, equal fates partake."

Then he: "O prince! allied in blood and fame,
Dearer than all that own a brother's name;
Of all that Hecuba to Priam bore,
Long tried, long loved: much loved, but honoured more!
Since you, of all our numerous race alone
Defend my life, regardless of your own."

Again the goddess: "Much my father's prayer,
And much my mother's, press'd me to forbear:
My friends embraced my knees, adjured my stay,
But stronger love impell'd, and I obey.
Come then, the glorious conflict let us try,
Let the steel sparkle, and the javelin fly;
Or let us stretch Achilles on the field,
Or to his arm our bloody trophies yield."

Fraudful she said; then swiftly march'd before:
The Dardan hero shuns his foe no more.
Sternly they met. The silence Hector broke:
His dreadful plumage nodded as he spoke:

"Enough, O son of Peleus! Troy has view'd
Her walls thrice circled, and her chief pursued.
But now some god within me bids me try
Thine, or my fate: I kill thee, or I die.
Yet on the verge of battle let us stay,
And for a moment's space suspend the day;
Let Heaven's high powers be call'd to arbitrate
The just conditions of this stern debate,
(Eternal witnesses of all below,
And faithful guardians of the treasured vow!)
To them I swear; if, victor in the strife,
Jove by these hands shall shed thy noble life,
No vile dishonour shall thy corse pursue;
Stripp'd of its arms alone (the conqueror's due)
The rest to Greece uninjured I'll restore:
Now plight thy mutual oath, I ask no more."

"Talk not of oaths (the dreadful chief replies,
While anger flash'd from his disdainful eyes),
Detested as thou art, and ought to be,
Nor oath nor pact Achilles plights with thee:
Such pacts as lambs and rabid wolves combine,
Such leagues as men and furious lions join,
To such I call the gods! one constant state
Of lasting rancour and eternal hate:
No thought but rage, and never-ceasing strife,
Till death extinguish rage, and thought, and life.
Rouse then thy forces this important hour,
Collect thy soul, and call forth all thy power.
No further subterfuge, no further chance;
'Tis Pallas, Pallas gives thee to my lance.
Each Grecian ghost, by thee deprived of breath,
Now hovers round, and calls thee to thy death."

He spoke, and launch'd his javelin at the foe;
But Hector shunn'd the meditated blow:
He stoop'd, while o'er his head the flying spear
Sang innocent, and spent its force in air.
Minerva watch'd it falling on the land,
Then drew, and gave to great Achilles' hand,
Unseen of Hector, who, elate with joy,
Now shakes his lance, and braves the dread of Troy.

"The life you boasted to that javelin given,
Prince! you have miss'd. My fate depends on Heaven,
To thee, presumptuous as thou art, unknown,
Or what must prove my fortune, or thy own.
Boasting is but an art, our fears to blind,
And with false terrors sink another's mind.
But know, whatever fate I am to try,
By no dishonest wound shall Hector die.
I shall not fall a fugitive at least,
My soul shall bravely issue from my breast.
But first, try thou my arm; and may this dart
End all my country's woes, deep buried in thy heart."

The weapon flew, its course unerring held,
Unerring, but the heavenly shield repell'd
The mortal dart; resulting with a bound
From off the ringing orb, it struck the ground.
Hector beheld his javelin fall in vain,
Nor other lance, nor other hope remain;
He calls Deiphobus, demands a spear--
In vain, for no Deiphobus was there.
All comfortless he stands: then, with a sigh;
"'Tis so--Heaven wills it, and my hour is nigh!
I deem'd Deiphobus had heard my call,
But he secure lies guarded in the wall.
A god deceived me; Pallas, 'twas thy deed,
Death and black fate approach! 'tis I must bleed.
No refuge now, no succour from above,
Great Jove deserts me, and the son of Jove,
Propitious once, and kind! Then welcome fate!
'Tis true I perish, yet I perish great:
Yet in a mighty deed I shall expire,
Let future ages hear it, and admire!"

Fierce, at the word, his weighty sword he drew,
And, all collected, on Achilles flew.
So Jove's bold bird, high balanced in the air,
Stoops from the clouds to truss the quivering hare.
Nor less Achilles his fierce soul prepares:
Before his breast the flaming shield he bears,
Refulgent orb! above his fourfold cone
The gilded horse-hair sparkled in the sun.
Nodding at every step: (Vulcanian frame!)
And as he moved, his figure seem'd on flame.
As radiant Hesper shines with keener light,(277)
Far-beaming o'er the silver host of night,
When all the starry train emblaze the sphere:
So shone the point of great Achilles' spear.
In his right hand he waves the weapon round,
Eyes the whole man, and meditates the wound;
But the rich mail Patroclus lately wore
Securely cased the warrior's body o'er.
One space at length he spies, to let in fate,
Where 'twixt the neck and throat the jointed plate
Gave entrance: through that penetrable part
Furious he drove the well-directed dart:
Nor pierced the windpipe yet, nor took the power
Of speech, unhappy! from thy dying hour.
Prone on the field the bleeding warrior lies,
While, thus triumphing, stern Achilles cries:

"At last is Hector stretch'd upon the plain,
Who fear'd no vengeance for Patroclus slain:
Then, prince! you should have fear'd, what now you feel;
Achilles absent was Achilles still:
Yet a short space the great avenger stayed,
Then low in dust thy strength and glory laid.
Peaceful he sleeps, with all our rites adorn'd,
For ever honour'd, and for ever mourn'd:
While cast to all the rage of hostile power,
Thee birds shall mangle, and the gods devour."

Then Hector, fainting at the approach of death:
"By thy own soul! by those who gave thee breath!
By all the sacred prevalence of prayer;
Ah, leave me not for Grecian dogs to tear!
The common rites of sepulture bestow,
To soothe a father's and a mother's woe:
Let their large gifts procure an urn at least,
And Hector's ashes in his country rest."

"No, wretch accursed! relentless he replies;
(Flames, as he spoke, shot flashing from his eyes;)
Not those who gave me breath should bid me spare,
Nor all the sacred prevalence of prayer.
Could I myself the bloody banquet join!
No--to the dogs that carcase I resign.
Should Troy, to bribe me, bring forth all her store,
And giving thousands, offer thousands more;
Should Dardan Priam, and his weeping dame,
Drain their whole realm to buy one funeral flame:
Their Hector on the pile they should not see,
Nor rob the vultures of one limb of thee."

Then thus the chief his dying accents drew:
"Thy rage, implacable! too well I knew:
The Furies that relentless breast have steel'd,
And cursed thee with a heart that cannot yield.
Yet think, a day will come, when fate's decree
And angry gods shall wreak this wrong on thee;
Phoebus and Paris shall avenge my fate,
And stretch thee here before the Scaean gate."(278)

He ceased. The Fates suppress'd his labouring breath,
And his eyes stiffen'd at the hand of death;
To the dark realm the spirit wings its way,
(The manly body left a load of clay,)
And plaintive glides along the dreary coast,
A naked, wandering, melancholy ghost!

Achilles, musing as he roll'd his eyes
O'er the dead hero, thus unheard, replies:
"Die thou the first! When Jove and heaven ordain,
I follow thee"--He said, and stripp'd the slain.
Then forcing backward from the gaping wound
The reeking javelin, cast it on the ground.
The thronging Greeks behold with wondering eyes
His manly beauty and superior size;
While some, ignobler, the great dead deface
With wounds ungenerous, or with taunts disgrace:

"How changed that Hector, who like Jove of late
Sent lightning on our fleets, and scatter'd fate!"

High o'er the slain the great Achilles stands,
Begirt with heroes and surrounding bands;
And thus aloud, while all the host attends:
"Princes and leaders! countrymen and friends!
Since now at length the powerful will of heaven
The dire destroyer to our arm has given,
Is not Troy fallen already? Haste, ye powers!
See, if already their deserted towers
Are left unmann'd; or if they yet retain
The souls of heroes, their great Hector slain.
But what is Troy, or glory what to me?
Or why reflects my mind on aught but thee,
Divine Patroclus! Death hath seal'd his eyes;
Unwept, unhonour'd, uninterr'd he lies!
Can his dear image from my soul depart,
Long as the vital spirit moves my heart?
If in the melancholy shades below,
The flames of friends and lovers cease to glow,
Yet mine shall sacred last; mine, undecay'd,
Burn on through death, and animate my shade.
Meanwhile, ye sons of Greece, in triumph bring
The corpse of Hector, and your paeans sing.
Be this the song, slow-moving toward the shore,
"Hector is dead, and Ilion is no more."

Then his fell soul a thought of vengeance bred;
(Unworthy of himself, and of the dead;)
The nervous ancles bored, his feet he bound
With thongs inserted through the double wound;
These fix'd up high behind the rolling wain,
His graceful head was trail'd along the plain.
Proud on his car the insulting victor stood,
And bore aloft his arms, distilling blood.
He smites the steeds; the rapid chariot flies;
The sudden clouds of circling dust arise.
Now lost is all that formidable air;
The face divine, and long-descending hair,
Purple the ground, and streak the sable sand;
Deform'd, dishonour'd, in his native land,
Given to the rage of an insulting throng,
And, in his parents' sight, now dragg'd along!

The mother first beheld with sad survey;
She rent her tresses, venerable grey,
And cast, far off, the regal veils away.
With piercing shrieks his bitter fate she moans,
While the sad father answers groans with groans
Tears after tears his mournful cheeks o'erflow,
And the whole city wears one face of woe:
No less than if the rage of hostile fires.
From her foundations curling to her spires,
O'er the proud citadel at length should rise,
And the last blaze send Ilion to the skies.
The wretched monarch of the falling state,
Distracted, presses to the Dardan gate.
Scarce the whole people stop his desperate course,
While strong affliction gives the feeble force:
Grief tears his heart, and drives him to and fro,
In all the raging impotence of woe.
At length he roll'd in dust, and thus begun,
Imploring all, and naming one by one:
"Ah! let me, let me go where sorrow calls;
I, only I, will issue from your walls
(Guide or companion, friends! I ask ye none),
And bow before the murderer of my son.
My grief perhaps his pity may engage;
Perhaps at least he may respect my age.
He has a father too; a man like me;
One, not exempt from age and misery
(Vigorous no more, as when his young embrace
Begot this pest of me, and all my race).
How many valiant sons, in early bloom,
Has that cursed hand send headlong to the tomb!
Thee, Hector! last: thy loss (divinely brave)
Sinks my sad soul with sorrow to the grave.
O had thy gentle spirit pass'd in peace,
The son expiring in the sire's embrace,
While both thy parents wept the fatal hour,
And, bending o'er thee, mix'd the tender shower!
Some comfort that had been, some sad relief,
To melt in full satiety of grief!"

Thus wail'd the father, grovelling on the ground,
And all the eyes of Ilion stream'd around.

Amidst her matrons Hecuba appears:
(A mourning princess, and a train in tears;)
"Ah why has Heaven prolong'd this hated breath,
Patient of horrors, to behold thy death?
O Hector! late thy parents' pride and joy,
The boast of nations! the defence of Troy!
To whom her safety and her fame she owed;
Her chief, her hero, and almost her god!
O fatal change! become in one sad day
A senseless corse! inanimated clay!"

But not as yet the fatal news had spread
To fair Andromache, of Hector dead;
As yet no messenger had told his fate,
Not e'en his stay without the Scaean gate.
Far in the close recesses of the dome,
Pensive she plied the melancholy loom;
A growing work employ'd her secret hours,
Confusedly gay with intermingled flowers.
Her fair-haired handmaids heat the brazen urn,
The bath preparing for her lord's return
In vain; alas! her lord returns no more;
Unbathed he lies, and bleeds along the shore!
Now from the walls the clamours reach her ear,
And all her members shake with sudden fear:
Forth from her ivory hand the shuttle falls,
And thus, astonish'd, to her maids she calls:

                      [Illustration: THE BATH.]

                              THE BATH.


"Ah follow me! (she cried) what plaintive noise
Invades my ear? 'Tis sure my mother's voice.
My faltering knees their trembling frame desert,
A pulse unusual flutters at my heart;
Some strange disaster, some reverse of fate
(Ye gods avert it!) threats the Trojan state.
Far be the omen which my thoughts suggest!
But much I fear my Hector's dauntless breast
Confronts Achilles; chased along the plain,
Shut from our walls! I fear, I fear him slain!
Safe in the crowd he ever scorn'd to wait,
And sought for glory in the jaws of fate:
Perhaps that noble heat has cost his breath,
Now quench'd for ever in the arms of death."

She spoke: and furious, with distracted pace,
Fears in her heart, and anguish in her face,
Flies through the dome (the maids her steps pursue),
And mounts the walls, and sends around her view.
Too soon her eyes the killing object found,
The godlike Hector dragg'd along the ground.
A sudden darkness shades her swimming eyes:
She faints, she falls; her breath, her colour flies.
Her hair's fair ornaments, the braids that bound,
The net that held them, and the wreath that crown'd,
The veil and diadem flew far away
(The gift of Venus on her bridal day).
Around a train of weeping sisters stands,
To raise her sinking with assistant hands.
Scarce from the verge of death recall'd, again
She faints, or but recovers to complain.

           [Illustration: ANDROMACHE FAINTING ON THE WALL.]

                   ANDROMACHE FAINTING ON THE WALL.


"O wretched husband of a wretched wife!
Born with one fate, to one unhappy life!
For sure one star its baneful beam display'd
On Priam's roof, and Hippoplacia's shade.
From different parents, different climes we came.
At different periods, yet our fate the same!
Why was my birth to great Aetion owed,
And why was all that tender care bestow'd?
Would I had never been!--O thou, the ghost
Of my dead husband! miserably lost!
Thou to the dismal realms for ever gone!
And I abandon'd, desolate, alone!
An only child, once comfort of my pains,
Sad product now of hapless love, remains!
No more to smile upon his sire; no friend
To help him now! no father to defend!
For should he 'scape the sword, the common doom,
What wrongs attend him, and what griefs to come!
Even from his own paternal roof expell'd,
Some stranger ploughs his patrimonial field.
The day, that to the shades the father sends,
Robs the sad orphan of his father's friends:
He, wretched outcast of mankind! appears
For ever sad, for ever bathed in tears;
Amongst the happy, unregarded, he
Hangs on the robe, or trembles at the knee,
While those his father's former bounty fed
Nor reach the goblet, nor divide the bread:
The kindest but his present wants allay,
To leave him wretched the succeeding day.
Frugal compassion! Heedless, they who boast
Both parents still, nor feel what he has lost,
Shall cry, 'Begone! thy father feasts not here:'
The wretch obeys, retiring with a tear.
Thus wretched, thus retiring all in tears,
To my sad soul Astyanax appears!
Forced by repeated insults to return,
And to his widow'd mother vainly mourn:
He, who, with tender delicacy bred,
With princes sported, and on dainties fed,
And when still evening gave him up to rest,
Sunk soft in down upon the nurse's breast,
Must--ah what must he not? Whom Ilion calls
Astyanax, from her well-guarded walls,(279)
Is now that name no more, unhappy boy!
Since now no more thy father guards his Troy.
But thou, my Hector, liest exposed in air,
Far from thy parents' and thy consort's care;
Whose hand in vain, directed by her love,
The martial scarf and robe of triumph wove.
Now to devouring flames be these a prey,
Useless to thee, from this accursed day!
Yet let the sacrifice at least be paid,
An honour to the living, not the dead!"

So spake the mournful dame: her matrons hear,
Sigh back her sighs, and answer tear with tear.





BOOK XXIII.


ARGUMENT.

FUNERAL GAMES IN HONOUR OF PATROCLUS.(280)

Achilles and the Myrmidons do honours to the body of Patroclus. After the
funeral feast he retires to the sea-shore, where, falling asleep, the
ghost of his friend appears to him, and demands the rites of burial; the
next morning the soldiers are sent with mules and waggons to fetch wood
for the pyre. The funeral procession, and the offering their hair to the
dead. Achilles sacrifices several animals, and lastly twelve Trojan
captives, at the pile; then sets fire to it. He pays libations to the
Winds, which (at the instance of Iris) rise, and raise the flames. When
the pile has burned all night, they gather the bones, place them in an urn
of gold, and raise the tomb. Achilles institutes the funeral games: the
chariot-race, the fight of the caestus, the wrestling, the foot-race, the
single combat, the discus, the shooting with arrows, the darting the
javelin: the various descriptions of which, and the various success of the
several antagonists, make the greatest part of the book.

In this book ends the thirtieth day. The night following, the ghost of
Patroclus appears to Achilles: the one-and-thirtieth day is employed in
felling the timber for the pile: the two-and-thirtieth in burning it; and
the three-and-thirtieth in the games. The scene is generally on the
sea-shore.

Thus humbled in the dust, the pensive train
Through the sad city mourn'd her hero slain.
The body soil'd with dust, and black with gore,
Lies on broad Hellespont's resounding shore.
The Grecians seek their ships, and clear the strand,
All, but the martial Myrmidonian band:
These yet assembled great Achilles holds,
And the stern purpose of his mind unfolds:

"Not yet, my brave companions of the war,
Release your smoking coursers from the car;
But, with his chariot each in order led,
Perform due honours to Patroclus dead.
Ere yet from rest or food we seek relief,
Some rites remain, to glut our rage of grief."

The troops obey'd; and thrice in order led(281)
(Achilles first) their coursers round the dead;
And thrice their sorrows and laments renew;
Tears bathe their arms, and tears the sands bedew.
For such a warrior Thetis aids their woe,
Melts their strong hearts, and bids their eyes to flow.
But chief, Pelides: thick-succeeding sighs
Burst from his heart, and torrents from his eyes:
His slaughtering hands, yet red with blood, he laid
On his dead friend's cold breast, and thus he said:

"All hail, Patroclus! let thy honour'd ghost
Hear, and rejoice on Pluto's dreary coast;
Behold! Achilles' promise is complete;
The bloody Hector stretch'd before thy feet.
Lo! to the dogs his carcase I resign;
And twelve sad victims, of the Trojan line,
Sacred to vengeance, instant shall expire;
Their lives effused around thy funeral pyre."

Gloomy he said, and (horrible to view)
Before the bier the bleeding Hector threw,
Prone on the dust. The Myrmidons around
Unbraced their armour, and the steeds unbound.
All to Achilles' sable ship repair,
Frequent and full, the genial feast to share.
Now from the well-fed swine black smokes aspire,
The bristly victims hissing o'er the fire:
The huge ox bellowing falls; with feebler cries
Expires the goat; the sheep in silence dies.
Around the hero's prostrate body flow'd,
In one promiscuous stream, the reeking blood.
And now a band of Argive monarchs brings
The glorious victor to the king of kings.
From his dead friend the pensive warrior went,
With steps unwilling, to the regal tent.
The attending heralds, as by office bound,
With kindled flames the tripod-vase surround:
To cleanse his conquering hands from hostile gore,
They urged in vain; the chief refused, and swore:(282)

"No drop shall touch me, by almighty Jove!
The first and greatest of the gods above!
Till on the pyre I place thee; till I rear
The grassy mound, and clip thy sacred hair.
Some ease at least those pious rites may give,
And soothe my sorrows, while I bear to live.
Howe'er, reluctant as I am, I stay
And share your feast; but with the dawn of day,
(O king of men!) it claims thy royal care,
That Greece the warrior's funeral pile prepare,
And bid the forests fall: (such rites are paid
To heroes slumbering in eternal shade:)
Then, when his earthly part shall mount in fire,
Let the leagued squadrons to their posts retire."

He spoke: they hear him, and the word obey;
The rage of hunger and of thirst allay,
Then ease in sleep the labours of the day.
But great Pelides, stretch'd along the shore,
Where, dash'd on rocks, the broken billows roar,
Lies inly groaning; while on either hand
The martial Myrmidons confusedly stand.
Along the grass his languid members fall,
Tired with his chase around the Trojan wall;
Hush'd by the murmurs of the rolling deep,
At length he sinks in the soft arms of sleep.
When lo! the shade, before his closing eyes,
Of sad Patroclus rose, or seem'd to rise:
In the same robe he living wore, he came:
In stature, voice, and pleasing look, the same.
The form familiar hover'd o'er his head,
"And sleeps Achilles? (thus the phantom said:)
Sleeps my Achilles, his Patroclus dead?
Living, I seem'd his dearest, tenderest care,
But now forgot, I wander in the air.
Let my pale corse the rites of burial know,
And give me entrance in the realms below:
Till then the spirit finds no resting-place,
But here and there the unbodied spectres chase
The vagrant dead around the dark abode,
Forbid to cross the irremeable flood.
Now give thy hand; for to the farther shore
When once we pass, the soul returns no more:
When once the last funereal flames ascend,
No more shall meet Achilles and his friend;
No more our thoughts to those we loved make known;
Or quit the dearest, to converse alone.
Me fate has sever'd from the sons of earth,
The fate fore-doom'd that waited from my birth:
Thee too it waits; before the Trojan wall
Even great and godlike thou art doom'd to fall.
Hear then; and as in fate and love we join,
Ah suffer that my bones may rest with thine!
Together have we lived; together bred,
One house received us, and one table fed;
That golden urn, thy goddess-mother gave,
May mix our ashes in one common grave."

"And is it thou? (he answers) To my sight(283)
Once more return'st thou from the realms of night?
O more than brother! Think each office paid,
Whate'er can rest a discontented shade;
But grant one last embrace, unhappy boy!
Afford at least that melancholy joy."

He said, and with his longing arms essay'd
In vain to grasp the visionary shade!
Like a thin smoke he sees the spirit fly,(284)
And hears a feeble, lamentable cry.
Confused he wakes; amazement breaks the bands
Of golden sleep, and starting from the sands,
Pensive he muses with uplifted hands:

"'Tis true, 'tis certain; man, though dead, retains
Part of himself; the immortal mind remains:
The form subsists without the body's aid,
Aerial semblance, and an empty shade!
This night my friend, so late in battle lost,
Stood at my side, a pensive, plaintive ghost:
Even now familiar, as in life, he came;
Alas! how different! yet how like the same!"

Thus while he spoke, each eye grew big with tears:
And now the rosy-finger'd morn appears,
Shows every mournful face with tears o'erspread,
And glares on the pale visage of the dead.
But Agamemnon, as the rites demand,
With mules and waggons sends a chosen band
To load the timber, and the pile to rear;
A charge consign'd to Merion's faithful care.
With proper instruments they take the road,
Axes to cut, and ropes to sling the load.
First march the heavy mules, securely slow,
O'er hills, o'er dales, o'er crags, o'er rocks they go:(285)
Jumping, high o'er the shrubs of the rough ground,
Rattle the clattering cars, and the shock'd axles bound
But when arrived at Ida's spreading woods,(286)
(Fair Ida, water'd with descending floods,)
Loud sounds the axe, redoubling strokes on strokes;
On all sides round the forest hurls her oaks
Headlong. Deep echoing groan the thickets brown;
Then rustling, crackling, crashing, thunder down.
The wood the Grecians cleave, prepared to burn;
And the slow mules the same rough road return
The sturdy woodmen equal burdens bore
(Such charge was given them) to the sandy shore;
There on the spot which great Achilles show'd,
They eased their shoulders, and disposed the load;
Circling around the place, where times to come
Shall view Patroclus' and Achilles' tomb.
The hero bids his martial troops appear
High on their cars in all the pomp of war;
Each in refulgent arms his limbs attires,
All mount their chariots, combatants and squires.
The chariots first proceed, a shining train;
Then clouds of foot that smoke along the plain;
Next these the melancholy band appear;
Amidst, lay dead Patroclus on the bier;
O'er all the corse their scattered locks they throw;
Achilles next, oppress'd with mighty woe,
Supporting with his hands the hero's head,
Bends o'er the extended body of the dead.
Patroclus decent on the appointed ground
They place, and heap the sylvan pile around.
But great Achilles stands apart in prayer,
And from his head divides the yellow hair;
Those curling locks which from his youth he vow'd,(287)
And sacred grew, to Sperchius' honour'd flood:
Then sighing, to the deep his locks he cast,
And roll'd his eyes around the watery waste:

"Sperchius! whose waves in mazy errors lost
Delightful roll along my native coast!
To whom we vainly vow'd, at our return,
These locks to fall, and hecatombs to burn:
Full fifty rams to bleed in sacrifice,
Where to the day thy silver fountains rise,
And where in shade of consecrated bowers
Thy altars stand, perfumed with native flowers!
So vow'd my father, but he vow'd in vain;
No more Achilles sees his native plain;
In that vain hope these hairs no longer grow,
Patroclus bears them to the shades below."

Thus o'er Patroclus while the hero pray'd,
On his cold hand the sacred lock he laid.
Once more afresh the Grecian sorrows flow:
And now the sun had set upon their woe;
But to the king of men thus spoke the chief:
"Enough, Atrides! give the troops relief:
Permit the mourning legions to retire,
And let the chiefs alone attend the pyre;
The pious care be ours, the dead to burn--"
He said: the people to their ships return:
While those deputed to inter the slain
Heap with a rising pyramid the plain.(288)
A hundred foot in length, a hundred wide,
The growing structure spreads on every side;
High on the top the manly corse they lay,
And well-fed sheep and sable oxen slay:
Achilles covered with their fat the dead,
And the piled victims round the body spread;
Then jars of honey, and of fragrant oil,
Suspends around, low-bending o'er the pile.
Four sprightly coursers, with a deadly groan
Pour forth their lives, and on the pyre are thrown.
Of nine large dogs, domestic at his board,
Fall two, selected to attend their lord,
Then last of all, and horrible to tell,
Sad sacrifice! twelve Trojan captives fell.(289)
On these the rage of fire victorious preys,
Involves and joins them in one common blaze.
Smear'd with the bloody rites, he stands on high,
And calls the spirit with a dreadful cry:(290)

"All hail, Patroclus! let thy vengeful ghost
Hear, and exult, on Pluto's dreary coast.
Behold Achilles' promise fully paid,
Twelve Trojan heroes offer'd to thy shade;
But heavier fates on Hector's corse attend,
Saved from the flames, for hungry dogs to rend."

So spake he, threatening: but the gods made vain
His threat, and guard inviolate the slain:
Celestial Venus hover'd o'er his head,
And roseate unguents, heavenly fragrance! shed:
She watch'd him all the night and all the day,
And drove the bloodhounds from their destined prey.
Nor sacred Phoebus less employ'd his care;
He pour'd around a veil of gather'd air,
And kept the nerves undried, the flesh entire,
Against the solar beam and Sirian fire.

            [Illustration: THE FUNERAL PILE OF PATROCLUS.]

                    THE FUNERAL PILE OF PATROCLUS.


Nor yet the pile, where dead Patroclus lies,
Smokes, nor as yet the sullen flames arise;
But, fast beside, Achilles stood in prayer,
Invoked the gods whose spirit moves the air,
And victims promised, and libations cast,
To gentle Zephyr and the Boreal blast:
He call'd the aerial powers, along the skies
To breathe, and whisper to the fires to rise.
The winged Iris heard the hero's call,
And instant hasten'd to their airy hall,
Where in old Zephyr's open courts on high,
Sat all the blustering brethren of the sky.
She shone amidst them, on her painted bow;
The rocky pavement glitter'd with the show.
All from the banquet rise, and each invites
The various goddess to partake the rites.
"Not so (the dame replied), I haste to go
To sacred Ocean, and the floods below:
Even now our solemn hecatombs attend,
And heaven is feasting on the world's green end
With righteous Ethiops (uncorrupted train!)
Far on the extremest limits of the main.
But Peleus' son entreats, with sacrifice,
The western spirit, and the north, to rise!
Let on Patroclus' pile your blast be driven,
And bear the blazing honours high to heaven."

Swift as the word she vanish'd from their view;
Swift as the word the winds tumultuous flew;
Forth burst the stormy band with thundering roar,
And heaps on heaps the clouds are toss'd before.
To the wide main then stooping from the skies,
The heaving deeps in watery mountains rise:
Troy feels the blast along her shaking walls,
Till on the pile the gather'd tempest falls.
The structure crackles in the roaring fires,
And all the night the plenteous flame aspires.
All night Achilles hails Patroclus' soul,
With large libations from the golden bowl.
As a poor father, helpless and undone,
Mourns o'er the ashes of an only son,
Takes a sad pleasure the last bones to burn,
And pours in tears, ere yet they close the urn:
So stay'd Achilles, circling round the shore,
So watch'd the flames, till now they flame no more.
'Twas when, emerging through the shades of night.
The morning planet told the approach of light;
And, fast behind, Aurora's warmer ray
O'er the broad ocean pour'd the golden day:
Then sank the blaze, the pile no longer burn'd,
And to their caves the whistling winds return'd:
Across the Thracian seas their course they bore;
The ruffled seas beneath their passage roar.

Then parting from the pile he ceased to weep,
And sank to quiet in the embrace of sleep,
Exhausted with his grief: meanwhile the crowd
Of thronging Grecians round Achilles stood;
The tumult waked him: from his eyes he shook
Unwilling slumber, and the chiefs bespoke:

"Ye kings and princes of the Achaian name!
First let us quench the yet remaining flame
With sable wine; then, as the rites direct,
The hero's bones with careful view select:
(Apart, and easy to be known they lie
Amidst the heap, and obvious to the eye:
The rest around the margin will be seen
Promiscuous, steeds and immolated men:)
These wrapp'd in double cauls of fat, prepare;
And in the golden vase dispose with care;
There let them rest with decent honour laid,
Till I shall follow to the infernal shade.
Meantime erect the tomb with pious hands,
A common structure on the humble sands:
Hereafter Greece some nobler work may raise,
And late posterity record our praise!"

The Greeks obey; where yet the embers glow,
Wide o'er the pile the sable wine they throw,
And deep subsides the ashy heap below.
Next the white bones his sad companions place,
With tears collected, in the golden vase.
The sacred relics to the tent they bore;
The urn a veil of linen covered o'er.
That done, they bid the sepulchre aspire,
And cast the deep foundations round the pyre;
High in the midst they heap the swelling bed
Of rising earth, memorial of the dead.

The swarming populace the chief detains,
And leads amidst a wide extent of plains;
There placed them round: then from the ships proceeds
A train of oxen, mules, and stately steeds,
Vases and tripods (for the funeral games),
Resplendent brass, and more resplendent dames.
First stood the prizes to reward the force
Of rapid racers in the dusty course:
A woman for the first, in beauty's bloom,
Skill'd in the needle, and the labouring loom;
And a large vase, where two bright handles rise,
Of twenty measures its capacious size.
The second victor claims a mare unbroke,
Big with a mule, unknowing of the yoke:
The third, a charger yet untouch'd by flame;
Four ample measures held the shining frame:
Two golden talents for the fourth were placed:
An ample double bowl contents the last.
These in fair order ranged upon the plain,
The hero, rising, thus address'd the train:

"Behold the prizes, valiant Greeks! decreed
To the brave rulers of the racing steed;
Prizes which none beside ourself could gain,
Should our immortal coursers take the plain;
(A race unrivall'd, which from ocean's god
Peleus received, and on his son bestow'd.)
But this no time our vigour to display;
Nor suit, with them, the games of this sad day:
Lost is Patroclus now, that wont to deck
Their flowing manes, and sleek their glossy neck.
Sad, as they shared in human grief, they stand,
And trail those graceful honours on the sand!
Let others for the noble task prepare,
Who trust the courser and the flying car."

Fired at his word the rival racers rise;
But far the first Eumelus hopes the prize,
Famed though Pieria for the fleetest breed,
And skill'd to manage the high-bounding steed.
With equal ardour bold Tydides swell'd,
The steeds of Tros beneath his yoke compell'd
(Which late obey'd the Dardan chiefs command,
When scarce a god redeem'd him from his hand).
Then Menelaus his Podargus brings,
And the famed courser of the king of kings:
Whom rich Echepolus (more rich than brave),
To 'scape the wars, to Agamemnon gave,
(Ćthe her name) at home to end his days;
Base wealth preferring to eternal praise.
Next him Antilochus demands the course
With beating heart, and cheers his Pylian horse.
Experienced Nestor gives his son the reins,
Directs his judgment, and his heat restrains;
Nor idly warns the hoary sire, nor hears
The prudent son with unattending ears.

"My son! though youthful ardour fire thy breast,
The gods have loved thee, and with arts have bless'd;
Neptune and Jove on thee conferr'd the skill
Swift round the goal to turn the flying wheel.
To guide thy conduct little precept needs;
But slow, and past their vigour, are my steeds.
Fear not thy rivals, though for swiftness known;
Compare those rivals' judgment and thy own:
It is not strength, but art, obtains the prize,
And to be swift is less than to be wise.
'Tis more by art than force of numerous strokes
The dexterous woodman shapes the stubborn oaks;
By art the pilot, through the boiling deep
And howling tempest, steers the fearless ship;
And 'tis the artist wins the glorious course;
Not those who trust in chariots and in horse.
In vain, unskilful to the goal they strive,
And short, or wide, the ungovern'd courser drive:
While with sure skill, though with inferior steeds,
The knowing racer to his end proceeds;
Fix'd on the goal his eye foreruns the course,
His hand unerring steers the steady horse,
And now contracts, or now extends the rein,
Observing still the foremost on the plain.
Mark then the goal, 'tis easy to be found;
Yon aged trunk, a cubit from the ground;
Of some once stately oak the last remains,
Or hardy fir, unperish'd with the rains:
Inclosed with stones, conspicuous from afar;
And round, a circle for the wheeling car.
(Some tomb perhaps of old, the dead to grace;
Or then, as now, the limit of a race.)
Bear close to this, and warily proceed,
A little bending to the left-hand steed;
But urge the right, and give him all the reins;
While thy strict hand his fellow's head restrains,
And turns him short; till, doubling as they roll,
The wheel's round naves appear to brush the goal.
Yet (not to break the car, or lame the horse)
Clear of the stony heap direct the course;
Lest through incaution failing, thou mayst be
A joy to others, a reproach to me.
So shalt thou pass the goal, secure of mind,
And leave unskilful swiftness far behind:
Though thy fierce rival drove the matchless steed
Which bore Adrastus, of celestial breed;
Or the famed race, through all the regions known,
That whirl'd the car of proud Laomedon."

Thus (nought unsaid) the much-advising sage
Concludes; then sat, stiff with unwieldy age.
Next bold Meriones was seen to rise,
The last, but not least ardent for the prize.
They mount their seats; the lots their place dispose
(Roll'd in his helmet, these Achilles throws).
Young Nestor leads the race: Eumelus then;
And next the brother of the king of men:
Thy lot, Meriones, the fourth was cast;
And, far the bravest, Diomed, was last.
They stand in order, an impatient train:
Pelides points the barrier on the plain,
And sends before old Phoenix to the place,
To mark the racers, and to judge the race.
At once the coursers from the barrier bound;
The lifted scourges all at once resound;
Their heart, their eyes, their voice, they send before;
And up the champaign thunder from the shore:
Thick, where they drive, the dusty clouds arise,
And the lost courser in the whirlwind flies;
Loose on their shoulders the long manes reclined,
Float in their speed, and dance upon the wind:
The smoking chariots, rapid as they bound,
Now seem to touch the sky, and now the ground.
While hot for fame, and conquest all their care,
(Each o'er his flying courser hung in air,)
Erect with ardour, poised upon the rein,
They pant, they stretch, they shout along the plain.
Now (the last compass fetch'd around the goal)
At the near prize each gathers all his soul,
Each burns with double hope, with double pain,
Tears up the shore, and thunders toward the main.
First flew Eumelus on Pheretian steeds;
With those of Tros bold Diomed succeeds:
Close on Eumelus' back they puff the wind,
And seem just mounting on his car behind;
Full on his neck he feels the sultry breeze,
And, hovering o'er, their stretching shadows sees.
Then had he lost, or left a doubtful prize;
But angry Phoebus to Tydides flies,
Strikes from his hand the scourge, and renders vain
His matchless horses' labour on the plain.
Rage fills his eye with anguish, to survey
Snatch'd from his hope the glories of the day.
The fraud celestial Pallas sees with pain,
Springs to her knight, and gives the scourge again,
And fills his steeds with vigour. At a stroke
She breaks his rival's chariot from the yoke:
No more their way the startled horses held;
The car reversed came rattling on the field;
Shot headlong from his seat, beside the wheel,
Prone on the dust the unhappy master fell;
His batter'd face and elbows strike the ground;
Nose, mouth, and front, one undistinguish'd wound:
Grief stops his voice, a torrent drowns his eyes:
Before him far the glad Tydides flies;
Minerva's spirit drives his matchless pace,
And crowns him victor of the labour'd race.

The next, though distant, Menelaus succeeds;
While thus young Nestor animates his steeds:
"Now, now, my generous pair, exert your force;
Not that we hope to match Tydides' horse,
Since great Minerva wings their rapid way,
And gives their lord the honours of the day;
But reach Atrides! shall his mare outgo
Your swiftness? vanquish'd by a female foe?
Through your neglect, if lagging on the plain
The last ignoble gift be all we gain,
No more shall Nestor's hand your food supply,
The old man's fury rises, and ye die.
Haste then: yon narrow road, before our sight,
Presents the occasion, could we use it right."

Thus he. The coursers at their master's threat
With quicker steps the sounding champaign beat.
And now Antilochus with nice survey
Observes the compass of the hollow way.
'Twas where, by force of wintry torrents torn,
Fast by the road a precipice was worn:
Here, where but one could pass, to shun the throng
The Spartan hero's chariot smoked along.
Close up the venturous youth resolves to keep,
Still edging near, and bears him toward the steep.
Atrides, trembling, casts his eye below,
And wonders at the rashness of his foe.
"Hold, stay your steeds--What madness thus to ride
This narrow way! take larger field (he cried),
Or both must fall."--Atrides cried in vain;
He flies more fast, and throws up all the rein.
Far as an able arm the disk can send,
When youthful rivals their full force extend,
So far, Antilochus! thy chariot flew
Before the king: he, cautious, backward drew
His horse compell'd; foreboding in his fears
The rattling ruin of the clashing cars,
The floundering coursers rolling on the plain,
And conquest lost through frantic haste to gain.
But thus upbraids his rival as he flies:
"Go, furious youth! ungenerous and unwise!
Go, but expect not I'll the prize resign;
Add perjury to fraud, and make it thine--"
Then to his steeds with all his force he cries,
"Be swift, be vigorous, and regain the prize!
Your rivals, destitute of youthful force,
With fainting knees shall labour in the course,
And yield the glory yours."--The steeds obey;
Already at their heels they wing their way,
And seem already to retrieve the day.

Meantime the Grecians in a ring beheld
The coursers bounding o'er the dusty field.
The first who mark'd them was the Cretan king;
High on a rising ground, above the ring,
The monarch sat: from whence with sure survey
He well observed the chief who led the way,
And heard from far his animating cries,
And saw the foremost steed with sharpen'd eyes;
On whose broad front a blaze of shining white,
Like the full moon, stood obvious to the sight.
He saw; and rising, to the Greeks begun:
"Are yonder horse discern'd by me alone?
Or can ye, all, another chief survey,
And other steeds than lately led the way?
Those, though the swiftest, by some god withheld,
Lie sure disabled in the middle field:
For, since the goal they doubled, round the plain
I search to find them, but I search in vain.
Perchance the reins forsook the driver's hand,
And, turn'd too short, he tumbled on the strand,
Shot from the chariot; while his coursers stray
With frantic fury from the destined way.
Rise then some other, and inform my sight,
For these dim eyes, perhaps, discern not right;
Yet sure he seems, to judge by shape and air,
The great Ćtolian chief, renown'd in war."

"Old man! (Oileus rashly thus replies)
Thy tongue too hastily confers the prize;
Of those who view the course, nor sharpest eyed,
Nor youngest, yet the readiest to decide.
Eumelus' steeds, high bounding in the chase,
Still, as at first, unrivall'd lead the race:
I well discern him, as he shakes the rein,
And hear his shouts victorious o'er the plain."

Thus he. Idomeneus, incensed, rejoin'd:
"Barbarous of words! and arrogant of mind!
Contentious prince, of all the Greeks beside
The last in merit, as the first in pride!
To vile reproach what answer can we make?
A goblet or a tripod let us stake,
And be the king the judge. The most unwise
Will learn their rashness, when they pay the price."

He said: and Ajax, by mad passion borne,
Stern had replied; fierce scorn enhancing scorn
To fell extremes. But Thetis' godlike son
Awful amidst them rose, and thus begun:

"Forbear, ye chiefs! reproachful to contend;
Much would ye blame, should others thus offend:
And lo! the approaching steeds your contest end."
No sooner had he spoke, but thundering near,
Drives, through a stream of dust, the charioteer.
High o'er his head the circling lash he wields:
His bounding horses scarcely touch the fields:
His car amidst the dusty whirlwind roll'd,
Bright with the mingled blaze of tin and gold,
Refulgent through the cloud: no eye could find
The track his flying wheels had left behind:
And the fierce coursers urged their rapid pace
So swift, it seem'd a flight, and not a race.
Now victor at the goal Tydides stands,
Quits his bright car, and springs upon the sands;
From the hot steeds the sweaty torrents stream;
The well-plied whip is hung athwart the beam:
With joy brave Sthenelus receives the prize,
The tripod-vase, and dame with radiant eyes:
These to the ships his train triumphant leads,
The chief himself unyokes the panting steeds.

Young Nestor follows (who by art, not force,
O'erpass'd Atrides) second in the course.
Behind, Atrides urged the race, more near
Than to the courser in his swift career
The following car, just touching with his heel
And brushing with his tail the whirling wheel:
Such, and so narrow now the space between
The rivals, late so distant on the green;
So soon swift Ćthe her lost ground regain'd,
One length, one moment, had the race obtain'd.

Merion pursued, at greater distance still,
With tardier coursers, and inferior skill.
Last came, Admetus! thy unhappy son;
Slow dragged the steeds his batter'd chariot on:
Achilles saw, and pitying thus begun:

"Behold! the man whose matchless art surpass'd
The sons of Greece! the ablest, yet the last!
Fortune denies, but justice bids us pay
(Since great Tydides bears the first away)
To him the second honours of the day."

The Greeks consent with loud-applauding cries,
And then Eumelus had received the prize,
But youthful Nestor, jealous of his fame,
The award opposes, and asserts his claim.
"Think not (he cries) I tamely will resign,
O Peleus' son! the mare so justly mine.
What if the gods, the skilful to confound,
Have thrown the horse and horseman to the ground?
Perhaps he sought not heaven by sacrifice,
And vows omitted forfeited the prize.
If yet (distinction to thy friend to show,
And please a soul desirous to bestow)
Some gift must grace Eumelus, view thy store
Of beauteous handmaids, steeds, and shining ore;
An ample present let him thence receive,
And Greece shall praise thy generous thirst to give.
But this my prize I never shall forego;
This, who but touches, warriors! is my foe."

Thus spake the youth; nor did his words offend;
Pleased with the well-turn'd flattery of a friend,
Achilles smiled: "The gift proposed (he cried),
Antilochus! we shall ourself provide.
With plates of brass the corslet cover'd o'er,
(The same renown'd Asteropaeus wore,)
Whose glittering margins raised with silver shine,
(No vulgar gift,) Eumelus! shall be thine."

He said: Automedon at his command
The corslet brought, and gave it to his hand.
Distinguish'd by his friend, his bosom glows
With generous joy: then Menelaus rose;
The herald placed the sceptre in his hands,
And still'd the clamour of the shouting bands.
Not without cause incensed at Nestor's son,
And inly grieving, thus the king begun:

"The praise of wisdom, in thy youth obtain'd,
An act so rash, Antilochus! has stain'd.
Robb'd of my glory and my just reward,
To you, O Grecians! be my wrong declared:
So not a leader shall our conduct blame,
Or judge me envious of a rival's fame.
But shall not we, ourselves, the truth maintain?
What needs appealing in a fact so plain?
What Greek shall blame me, if I bid thee rise,
And vindicate by oath th' ill-gotten prize?
Rise if thou darest, before thy chariot stand,
The driving scourge high-lifted in thy hand;
And touch thy steeds, and swear thy whole intent
Was but to conquer, not to circumvent.
Swear by that god whose liquid arms surround
The globe, and whose dread earthquakes heave the ground!"

The prudent chief with calm attention heard;
Then mildly thus: "Excuse, if youth have err'd;
Superior as thou art, forgive the offence,
Nor I thy equal, or in years, or sense.
Thou know'st the errors of unripen'd age,
Weak are its counsels, headlong is its rage.
The prize I quit, if thou thy wrath resign;
The mare, or aught thou ask'st, be freely thine
Ere I become (from thy dear friendship torn)
Hateful to thee, and to the gods forsworn."

So spoke Antilochus; and at the word
The mare contested to the king restored.
Joy swells his soul: as when the vernal grain
Lifts the green ear above the springing plain,
The fields their vegetable life renew,
And laugh and glitter with the morning dew;
Such joy the Spartan's shining face o'erspread,
And lifted his gay heart, while thus he said:

"Still may our souls, O generous youth! agree
'Tis now Atrides' turn to yield to thee.
Rash heat perhaps a moment might control,
Not break, the settled temper of thy soul.
Not but (my friend) 'tis still the wiser way
To waive contention with superior sway;
For ah! how few, who should like thee offend,
Like thee, have talents to regain the friend!
To plead indulgence, and thy fault atone,
Suffice thy father's merit and thy own:
Generous alike, for me, the sire and son
Have greatly suffer'd, and have greatly done.
I yield; that all may know, my soul can bend,
Nor is my pride preferr'd before my friend."

He said; and pleased his passion to command,
Resign'd the courser to Noemon's hand,
Friend of the youthful chief: himself content,
The shining charger to his vessel sent.
The golden talents Merion next obtain'd;
The fifth reward, the double bowl, remain'd.
Achilles this to reverend Nestor bears.
And thus the purpose of his gift declares:
"Accept thou this, O sacred sire! (he said)
In dear memorial of Patroclus dead;
Dead and for ever lost Patroclus lies,
For ever snatch'd from our desiring eyes!
Take thou this token of a grateful heart,
Though 'tis not thine to hurl the distant dart,
The quoit to toss, the ponderous mace to wield,
Or urge the race, or wrestle on the field:
Thy pristine vigour age has overthrown,
But left the glory of the past thy own."

He said, and placed the goblet at his side;
With joy the venerable king replied:

"Wisely and well, my son, thy words have proved
A senior honour'd, and a friend beloved!
Too true it is, deserted of my strength,
These wither'd arms and limbs have fail'd at length.
Oh! had I now that force I felt of yore,
Known through Buprasium and the Pylian shore!
Victorious then in every solemn game,
Ordain'd to Amarynces' mighty name;
The brave Epeians gave my glory way,
Ćtolians, Pylians, all resign'd the day.
I quell'd Clytomedes in fights of hand,
And backward hurl'd Ancaeus on the sand,
Surpass'd Iphyclus in the swift career,
Phyleus and Polydorus with the spear.
The sons of Actor won the prize of horse,
But won by numbers, not by art or force:
For the famed twins, impatient to survey
Prize after prize by Nestor borne away,
Sprung to their car; and with united pains
One lash'd the coursers, while one ruled the reins.
Such once I was! Now to these tasks succeeds
A younger race, that emulate our deeds:
I yield, alas! (to age who must not yield?)
Though once the foremost hero of the field.
Go thou, my son! by generous friendship led,
With martial honours decorate the dead:
While pleased I take the gift thy hands present,
(Pledge of benevolence, and kind intent,)
Rejoiced, of all the numerous Greeks, to see
Not one but honours sacred age and me:
Those due distinctions thou so well canst pay,
May the just gods return another day!"

Proud of the gift, thus spake the full of days:
Achilles heard him, prouder of the praise.

The prizes next are order'd to the field,
For the bold champions who the caestus wield.
A stately mule, as yet by toils unbroke,
Of six years' age, unconscious of the yoke,
Is to the circus led, and firmly bound;
Next stands a goblet, massy, large, and round.
Achilles rising, thus: "Let Greece excite
Two heroes equal to this hardy fight;
Who dare the foe with lifted arms provoke,
And rush beneath the long-descending stroke.
On whom Apollo shall the palm bestow,
And whom the Greeks supreme by conquest know,
This mule his dauntless labours shall repay,
The vanquish'd bear the massy bowl away."

This dreadful combat great Epeus chose;(291)
High o'er the crowd, enormous bulk! he rose,
And seized the beast, and thus began to say:
"Stand forth some man, to bear the bowl away!
(Price of his ruin: for who dares deny
This mule my right; the undoubted victor I)
Others, 'tis own'd, in fields of battle shine,
But the first honours of this fight are mine;
For who excels in all? Then let my foe
Draw near, but first his certain fortune know;
Secure this hand shall his whole frame confound,
Mash all his bones, and all his body pound:
So let his friends be nigh, a needful train,
To heave the batter'd carcase off the plain."

The giant spoke; and in a stupid gaze
The host beheld him, silent with amaze!
'Twas thou, Euryalus! who durst aspire
To meet his might, and emulate thy sire,
The great Mecistheus; who in days of yore
In Theban games the noblest trophy bore,
(The games ordain'd dead OEdipus to grace,)
And singly vanquish the Cadmean race.
Him great Tydides urges to contend,
Warm with the hopes of conquest for his friend;
Officious with the cincture girds him round;
And to his wrist the gloves of death are bound.
Amid the circle now each champion stands,
And poises high in air his iron hands;
With clashing gauntlets now they fiercely close,
Their crackling jaws re-echo to the blows,
And painful sweat from all their members flows.
At length Epeus dealt a weighty blow
Full on the cheek of his unwary foe;
Beneath that ponderous arm's resistless sway
Down dropp'd he, nerveless, and extended lay.
As a large fish, when winds and waters roar,
By some huge billow dash'd against the shore,
Lies panting; not less batter'd with his wound,
The bleeding hero pants upon the ground.
To rear his fallen foe, the victor lends,
Scornful, his hand; and gives him to his friends;
Whose arms support him, reeling through the throng,
And dragging his disabled legs along;
Nodding, his head hangs down his shoulder o'er;
His mouth and nostrils pour the clotted gore;(292)
Wrapp'd round in mists he lies, and lost to thought;
His friends receive the bowl, too dearly bought.

The third bold game Achilles next demands,
And calls the wrestlers to the level sands:
A massy tripod for the victor lies,
Of twice six oxen its reputed price;
And next, the loser's spirits to restore,
A female captive, valued but at four.
Scarce did the chief the vigorous strife prop
When tower-like Ajax and Ulysses rose.
Amid the ring each nervous rival stands,
Embracing rigid with implicit hands.
Close lock'd above, their heads and arms are mix'd:
Below, their planted feet at distance fix'd;
Like two strong rafters which the builder forms,
Proof to the wintry winds and howling storms,
Their tops connected, but at wider space
Fix'd on the centre stands their solid base.
Now to the grasp each manly body bends;
The humid sweat from every pore descends;
Their bones resound with blows: sides, shoulders, thighs
Swell to each gripe, and bloody tumours rise.
Nor could Ulysses, for his art renown'd,
O'erturn the strength of Ajax on the ground;
Nor could the strength of Ajax overthrow
The watchful caution of his artful foe.
While the long strife even tired the lookers on,
Thus to Ulysses spoke great Telamon:
"Or let me lift thee, chief, or lift thou me:
Prove we our force, and Jove the rest decree."

He said; and, straining, heaved him off the ground
With matchless strength; that time Ulysses found
The strength to evade, and where the nerves combine
His ankle struck: the giant fell supine;
Ulysses, following, on his bosom lies;
Shouts of applause run rattling through the skies.
Ajax to lift Ulysses next essays;
He barely stirr'd him, but he could not raise:
His knee lock'd fast, the foe's attempt denied;
And grappling close, they tumbled side by side.
Defiled with honourable dust they roll,
Still breathing strife, and unsubdued of soul:
Again they rage, again to combat rise;
When great Achilles thus divides the prize:

"Your noble vigour, O my friends, restrain;
Nor weary out your generous strength in vain.
Ye both have won: let others who excel,
Now prove that prowess you have proved so well."

The hero's words the willing chiefs obey,
From their tired bodies wipe the dust away,
And, clothed anew, the following games survey.

And now succeed the gifts ordain'd to grace
The youths contending in the rapid race:
A silver urn that full six measures held,
By none in weight or workmanship excell'd:
Sidonian artists taught the frame to shine,
Elaborate, with artifice divine;
Whence Tyrian sailors did the prize transport,
And gave to Thoas at the Lemnian port:
From him descended, good Eunaeus heir'd
The glorious gift; and, for Lycaon spared,
To brave Patroclus gave the rich reward:
Now, the same hero's funeral rites to grace,
It stands the prize of swiftness in the race.
A well-fed ox was for the second placed;
And half a talent must content the last.
Achilles rising then bespoke the train:
"Who hope the palm of swiftness to obtain,
Stand forth, and bear these prizes from the plain."

The hero said, and starting from his place,
Oilean Ajax rises to the race;
Ulysses next; and he whose speed surpass'd
His youthful equals, Nestor's son, the last.
Ranged in a line the ready racers stand;
Pelides points the barrier with his hand;
All start at once; Oileus led the race;
The next Ulysses, measuring pace with pace;
Behind him, diligently close, he sped,
As closely following as the running thread
The spindle follows, and displays the charms
Of the fair spinster's breast and moving arms:
Graceful in motion thus, his foe he plies,
And treads each footstep ere the dust can rise;
His glowing breath upon his shoulders plays:
The admiring Greeks loud acclamations raise:
To him they give their wishes, hearts, and eyes,
And send their souls before him as he flies.
Now three times turn'd in prospect of the goal,
The panting chief to Pallas lifts his soul:
"Assist, O goddess!" thus in thought he pray'd!
And present at his thought descends the maid.
Buoy'd by her heavenly force, he seems to swim,
And feels a pinion lifting every limb.
All fierce, and ready now the prize to gain,
Unhappy Ajax stumbles on the plain
(O'erturn'd by Pallas), where the slippery shore
Was clogg'd with slimy dung and mingled gore.
(The self-same place beside Patroclus' pyre,
Where late the slaughter'd victims fed the fire.)
Besmear'd with filth, and blotted o'er with clay,
Obscene to sight, the rueful racer lay;
The well-fed bull (the second prize) he shared,
And left the urn Ulysses' rich reward.
Then, grasping by the horn the mighty beast,
The baffled hero thus the Greeks address'd:

"Accursed fate! the conquest I forego;
A mortal I, a goddess was my foe;
She urged her favourite on the rapid way,
And Pallas, not Ulysses, won the day."

Thus sourly wail'd he, sputtering dirt and gore;
A burst of laughter echoed through the shore.
Antilochus, more humorous than the rest,
Takes the last prize, and takes it with a jest:

"Why with our wiser elders should we strive?
The gods still love them, and they always thrive.
Ye see, to Ajax I must yield the prize:
He to Ulysses, still more aged and wise;
(A green old age unconscious of decays,
That proves the hero born in better days!)
Behold his vigour in this active race!
Achilles only boasts a swifter pace:
For who can match Achilles? He who can,
Must yet be more than hero, more than man."

The effect succeeds the speech. Pelides cries,
"Thy artful praise deserves a better prize.
Nor Greece in vain shall hear thy friend extoll'd;
Receive a talent of the purest gold."
The youth departs content. The host admire
The son of Nestor, worthy of his sire.

Next these a buckler, spear, and helm, he brings;
Cast on the plain, the brazen burden rings:
Arms which of late divine Sarpedon wore,
And great Patroclus in short triumph bore.
"Stand forth the bravest of our host! (he cries)
Whoever dares deserve so rich a prize,
Now grace the lists before our army's sight,
And sheathed in steel, provoke his foe to fight.
Who first the jointed armour shall explore,
And stain his rival's mail with issuing gore,
The sword Asteropaeus possess'd of old,
(A Thracian blade, distinct with studs of gold,)
Shall pay the stroke, and grace the striker's side:
These arms in common let the chiefs divide:
For each brave champion, when the combat ends,
A sumptuous banquet at our tents attends."

Fierce at the word uprose great Tydeus' son,
And the huge bulk of Ajax Telamon.
Clad in refulgent steel, on either hand,
The dreadful chiefs amid the circle stand;
Louring they meet, tremendous to the sight;
Each Argive bosom beats with fierce delight.
Opposed in arms not long they idly stood,
But thrice they closed, and thrice the charge renew'd.
A furious pass the spear of Ajax made
Through the broad shield, but at the corslet stay'd.
Not thus the foe: his javelin aim'd above
The buckler's margin, at the neck he drove.
But Greece, now trembling for her hero's life,
Bade share the honours, and surcease the strife.
Yet still the victor's due Tydides gains,
With him the sword and studded belt remains.

Then hurl'd the hero, thundering on the ground,
A mass of iron (an enormous round),
Whose weight and size the circling Greeks admire,
Rude from the furnace, and but shaped by fire.
This mighty quoit Aetion wont to rear,
And from his whirling arm dismiss in air;
The giant by Achilles slain, he stow'd
Among his spoils this memorable load.
For this, he bids those nervous artists vie,
That teach the disk to sound along the sky.
"Let him, whose might can hurl this bowl, arise;
Who farthest hurls it, take it as his prize;
If he be one enrich'd with large domain
Of downs for flocks, and arable for grain,
Small stock of iron needs that man provide;
His hinds and swains whole years shall be supplied
From hence; nor ask the neighbouring city's aid
For ploughshares, wheels, and all the rural trade."

Stern Polypoetes stepp'd before the throng,
And great Leonteus, more than mortal strong;
Whose force with rival forces to oppose,
Uprose great Ajax; up Epeus rose.
Each stood in order: first Epeus threw;
High o'er the wondering crowds the whirling circle flew.
Leonteus next a little space surpass'd;
And third, the strength of godlike Ajax cast.
O'er both their marks it flew; till fiercely flung
From Polypoetes' arm the discus sung:
Far as a swain his whirling sheephook throws,
That distant falls among the grazing cows,
So past them all the rapid circle flies:
His friends, while loud applauses shake the skies,
With force conjoin'd heave off the weighty prize.

Those, who in skilful archery contend,
He next invites the twanging bow to bend;
And twice ten axes casts amidst the round,
Ten double-edged, and ten that singly wound
The mast, which late a first-rate galley bore,
The hero fixes in the sandy shore;
To the tall top a milk-white dove they tie,
The trembling mark at which their arrows fly.

"Whose weapon strikes yon fluttering bird, shall bear
These two-edged axes, terrible in war;
The single, he whose shaft divides the cord."
He said: experienced Merion took the word;
And skilful Teucer: in the helm they threw
Their lots inscribed, and forth the latter flew.
Swift from the string the sounding arrow flies;
But flies unbless'd! No grateful sacrifice,
No firstling lambs, unheedful! didst thou vow
To Phoebus, patron of the shaft and bow.
For this, thy well-aim'd arrow turn'd aside,
Err'd from the dove, yet cut the cord that tied:
Adown the mainmast fell the parted string,
And the free bird to heaven displays her wing:
Sea, shores, and skies, with loud applause resound,
And Merion eager meditates the wound:
He takes the bow, directs the shaft above,
And following with his eye the soaring dove,
Implores the god to speed it through the skies,
With vows of firstling lambs, and grateful sacrific
The dove, in airy circles as she wheels,
Amid the clouds the piercing arrow feels;
Quite through and through the point its passage found,
And at his feet fell bloody to the ground.
The wounded bird, ere yet she breathed her last,
With flagging wings alighted on the mast,
A moment hung, and spread her pinions there,
Then sudden dropp'd, and left her life in air.
From the pleased crowd new peals of thunder rise,
And to the ships brave Merion bears the prize.

To close the funeral games, Achilles last
A massy spear amid the circle placed,
And ample charger of unsullied frame,
With flowers high-wrought, not blacken'd yet by flame.
For these he bids the heroes prove their art,
Whose dexterous skill directs the flying dart.
Here too great Merion hopes the noble prize;
Nor here disdain'd the king of men to rise.
With joy Pelides saw the honour paid,
Rose to the monarch, and respectful said:

"Thee first in virtue, as in power supreme,
O king of nations! all thy Greeks proclaim;
In every martial game thy worth attest,
And know thee both their greatest and their best.
Take then the prize, but let brave Merion bear
This beamy javelin in thy brother's war."

Pleased from the hero's lips his praise to hear,
The king to Merion gives the brazen spear:
But, set apart for sacred use, commands
The glittering charger to Talthybius' hands.

BOOK XXIV.


ARGUMENT.

THE REDEMPTION OF THE BODY OF HECTOR.

The gods deliberate about the redemption of Hector's body. Jupiter sends
Thetis to Achilles, to dispose him for the restoring it, and Iris to
Priam, to encourage him to go in person and treat for it. The old king,
notwithstanding the remonstrances of his queen, makes ready for the
journey, to which he is encouraged by an omen from Jupiter. He sets forth
in his chariot, with a waggon loaded with presents, under the charge of
Idaeus the herald. Mercury descends in the shape of a young man, and
conducts him to the pavilion of Achilles. Their conversation on the way.
Priam finds Achilles at his table, casts himself at his feet, and begs for
the body of his son: Achilles, moved with compassion, grants his request,
detains him one night in his tent, and the next morning sends him home
with the body: the Trojans run out to meet him. The lamentations of
Andromache, Hecuba, and Helen, with the solemnities of the funeral.

The time of twelve days is employed in this book, while the body of Hector
lies in the tent of Achilles; and as many more are spent in the truce
allowed for his interment. The scene is partly in Achilles' camp, and
partly in Troy.

Now from the finish'd games the Grecian band
Seek their black ships, and clear the crowded strand,
All stretch'd at ease the genial banquet share,
And pleasing slumbers quiet all their care.
Not so Achilles: he, to grief resign'd,
His friend's dear image present to his mind,
Takes his sad couch, more unobserved to weep;
Nor tastes the gifts of all-composing sleep.
Restless he roll'd around his weary bed,
And all his soul on his Patroclus fed:
The form so pleasing, and the heart so kind,
That youthful vigour, and that manly mind,
What toils they shared, what martial works they wrought,
What seas they measured, and what fields they fought;
All pass'd before him in remembrance dear,
Thought follows thought, and tear succeeds to tear.
And now supine, now prone, the hero lay,
Now shifts his side, impatient for the day:
Then starting up, disconsolate he goes
Wide on the lonely beach to vent his woes.
There as the solitary mourner raves,
The ruddy morning rises o'er the waves:
Soon as it rose, his furious steeds he join'd!
The chariot flies, and Hector trails behind.
And thrice, Patroclus! round thy monument
Was Hector dragg'd, then hurried to the tent.
There sleep at last o'ercomes the hero's eyes;
While foul in dust the unhonour'd carcase lies,
But not deserted by the pitying skies:
For Phoebus watch'd it with superior care,
Preserved from gaping wounds and tainting air;
And, ignominious as it swept the field,
Spread o'er the sacred corse his golden shield.
All heaven was moved, and Hermes will'd to go
By stealth to snatch him from the insulting foe:
But Neptune this, and Pallas this denies,
And th' unrelenting empress of the skies,
E'er since that day implacable to Troy,
What time young Paris, simple shepherd boy,
Won by destructive lust (reward obscene),
Their charms rejected for the Cyprian queen.
But when the tenth celestial morning broke,
To heaven assembled, thus Apollo spoke:

        [Illustration: HECTOR'S BODY AT THE CAR OF ACHILLES.]

                HECTOR'S BODY AT THE CAR OF ACHILLES.


"Unpitying powers! how oft each holy fane
Has Hector tinged with blood of victims slain?
And can ye still his cold remains pursue?
Still grudge his body to the Trojans' view?
Deny to consort, mother, son, and sire,
The last sad honours of a funeral fire?
Is then the dire Achilles all your care?
That iron heart, inflexibly severe;
A lion, not a man, who slaughters wide,
In strength of rage, and impotence of pride;
Who hastes to murder with a savage joy,
Invades around, and breathes but to destroy!
Shame is not of his soul; nor understood,
The greatest evil and the greatest good.
Still for one loss he rages unresign'd,
Repugnant to the lot of all mankind;
To lose a friend, a brother, or a son,
Heaven dooms each mortal, and its will is done:
Awhile they sorrow, then dismiss their care;
Fate gives the wound, and man is born to bear.
But this insatiate, the commission given
By fate exceeds, and tempts the wrath of heaven:
Lo, how his rage dishonest drags along
Hector's dead earth, insensible of wrong!
Brave though he be, yet by no reason awed,
He violates the laws of man and god."

                [Illustration: THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.]

                        THE JUDGMENT OF PARIS.


"If equal honours by the partial skies
Are doom'd both heroes, (Juno thus replies,)
If Thetis' son must no distinction know,
Then hear, ye gods! the patron of the bow.
But Hector only boasts a mortal claim,
His birth deriving from a mortal dame:
Achilles, of your own ethereal race,
Springs from a goddess by a man's embrace
(A goddess by ourself to Peleus given,
A man divine, and chosen friend of heaven)
To grace those nuptials, from the bright abode
Yourselves were present; where this minstrel-god,
Well pleased to share the feast, amid the quire
Stood proud to hymn, and tune his youthful lyre."

Then thus the Thunderer checks the imperial dame:
"Let not thy wrath the court of heaven inflame;
Their merits, nor their honours, are the same.
But mine, and every god's peculiar grace
Hector deserves, of all the Trojan race:
Still on our shrines his grateful offerings lay,
(The only honours men to gods can pay,)
Nor ever from our smoking altar ceased
The pure libation, and the holy feast:
Howe'er by stealth to snatch the corse away,
We will not: Thetis guards it night and day.
But haste, and summon to our courts above
The azure queen; let her persuasion move
Her furious son from Priam to receive
The proffer'd ransom, and the corse to leave."

He added not: and Iris from the skies,
Swift as a whirlwind, on the message flies,
Meteorous the face of ocean sweeps,
Refulgent gliding o'er the sable deeps.
Between where Samos wide his forests spreads,
And rocky Imbrus lifts its pointed heads,
Down plunged the maid; (the parted waves resound;)
She plunged and instant shot the dark profound.
As bearing death in the fallacious bait,
From the bent angle sinks the leaden weight;
So pass'd the goddess through the closing wave,
Where Thetis sorrow'd in her secret cave:
There placed amidst her melancholy train
(The blue-hair'd sisters of the sacred main)
Pensive she sat, revolving fates to come,
And wept her godlike son's approaching doom.
Then thus the goddess of the painted bow:
"Arise, O Thetis! from thy seats below,
'Tis Jove that calls."--"And why (the dame replies)
Calls Jove his Thetis to the hated skies?
Sad object as I am for heavenly sight!
Ah may my sorrows ever shun the light!
Howe'er, be heaven's almighty sire obey'd--"
She spake, and veil'd her head in sable shade,
Which, flowing long, her graceful person clad;
And forth she paced, majestically sad.

Then through the world of waters they repair
(The way fair Iris led) to upper air.
The deeps dividing, o'er the coast they rise,
And touch with momentary flight the skies.
There in the lightning's blaze the sire they found,
And all the gods in shining synod round.
Thetis approach'd with anguish in her face,
(Minerva rising, gave the mourner place,)
Even Juno sought her sorrows to console,
And offer'd from her hand the nectar-bowl:
She tasted, and resign'd it: then began
The sacred sire of gods and mortal man:

"Thou comest, fair Thetis, but with grief o'ercast;
Maternal sorrows; long, ah, long to last!
Suffice, we know and we partake thy cares;
But yield to fate, and hear what Jove declares
Nine days are past since all the court above
In Hector's cause have moved the ear of Jove;
'Twas voted, Hermes from his godlike foe
By stealth should bear him, but we will'd not so:
We will, thy son himself the corse restore,
And to his conquest add this glory more.
Then hie thee to him, and our mandate bear:
Tell him he tempts the wrath of heaven too far;
Nor let him more (our anger if he dread)
Vent his mad vengeance on the sacred dead;
But yield to ransom and the father's prayer;
The mournful father, Iris shall prepare
With gifts to sue; and offer to his hands
Whate'er his honour asks, or heart demands."

His word the silver-footed queen attends,
And from Olympus' snowy tops descends.
Arrived, she heard the voice of loud lament,
And echoing groans that shook the lofty tent:
His friends prepare the victim, and dispose
Repast unheeded, while he vents his woes;
The goddess seats her by her pensive son,
She press'd his hand, and tender thus begun:

"How long, unhappy! shall thy sorrows flow,
And thy heart waste with life-consuming woe:
Mindless of food, or love, whose pleasing reign
Soothes weary life, and softens human pain?
O snatch the moments yet within thy power;
Not long to live, indulge the amorous hour!
Lo! Jove himself (for Jove's command I bear)
Forbids to tempt the wrath of heaven too far.
No longer then (his fury if thou dread)
Detain the relics of great Hector dead;
Nor vent on senseless earth thy vengeance vain,
But yield to ransom, and restore the slain."

To whom Achilles: "Be the ransom given,
And we submit, since such the will of heaven."

While thus they communed, from the Olympian bowers
Jove orders Iris to the Trojan towers:
"Haste, winged goddess! to the sacred town,
And urge her monarch to redeem his son.
Alone the Ilian ramparts let him leave,
And bear what stern Achilles may receive:
Alone, for so we will; no Trojan near
Except, to place the dead with decent care,
Some aged herald, who with gentle hand
May the slow mules and funeral car command.
Nor let him death, nor let him danger dread,
Safe through the foe by our protection led:
Him Hermes to Achilles shall convey,
Guard of his life, and partner of his way.
Fierce as he is, Achilles' self shall spare
His age, nor touch one venerable hair:
Some thought there must be in a soul so brave,
Some sense of duty, some desire to save."

   [Illustration: IRIS ADVISES PRIAM TO OBTAIN THE BODY OF HECTOR.]

           IRIS ADVISES PRIAM TO OBTAIN THE BODY OF HECTOR.


Then down her bow the winged Iris drives,
And swift at Priam's mournful court arrives:
Where the sad sons beside their father's throne
Sat bathed in tears, and answer'd groan with groan.
And all amidst them lay the hoary sire,
(Sad scene of woe!) his face his wrapp'd attire
Conceal'd from sight; with frantic hands he spread
A shower of ashes o'er his neck and head.
From room to room his pensive daughters roam;
Whose shrieks and clamours fill the vaulted dome;
Mindful of those, who late their pride and joy,
Lie pale and breathless round the fields of Troy!
Before the king Jove's messenger appears,
And thus in whispers greets his trembling ears:

"Fear not, O father! no ill news I bear;
From Jove I come, Jove makes thee still his care;
For Hector's sake these walls he bids thee leave,
And bear what stern Achilles may receive;
Alone, for so he wills; no Trojan near,
Except, to place the dead with decent care,
Some aged herald, who with gentle hand
May the slow mules and funeral car command.
Nor shalt thou death, nor shall thou danger dread:
Safe through the foe by his protection led:
Thee Hermes to Pelides shall convey,
Guard of thy life, and partner of thy way.
Fierce as he is, Achilles' self shall spare
Thy age, nor touch one venerable hair;
Some thought there must be in a soul so brave,
Some sense of duty, some desire to save."

She spoke, and vanish'd. Priam bids prepare
His gentle mules and harness to the car;
There, for the gifts, a polish'd casket lay:
His pious sons the king's command obey.
Then pass'd the monarch to his bridal-room,
Where cedar-beams the lofty roofs perfume,
And where the treasures of his empire lay;
Then call'd his queen, and thus began to say:

"Unhappy consort of a king distress'd!
Partake the troubles of thy husband's breast:
I saw descend the messenger of Jove,
Who bids me try Achilles' mind to move;
Forsake these ramparts, and with gifts obtain
The corse of Hector, at yon navy slain.
Tell me thy thought: my heart impels to go
Through hostile camps, and bears me to the foe."

The hoary monarch thus. Her piercing cries
Sad Hecuba renews, and then replies:
"Ah! whither wanders thy distemper'd mind?
And where the prudence now that awed mankind?
Through Phrygia once and foreign regions known;
Now all confused, distracted, overthrown!
Singly to pass through hosts of foes! to face
(O heart of steel!) the murderer of thy race!
To view that deathful eye, and wander o'er
Those hands yet red with Hector's noble gore!
Alas! my lord! he knows not how to spare.
And what his mercy, thy slain sons declare;
So brave! so many fallen! To claim his rage
Vain were thy dignity, and vain thy age.
No--pent in this sad palace, let us give
To grief the wretched days we have to live.
Still, still for Hector let our sorrows flow,
Born to his own, and to his parents' woe!
Doom'd from the hour his luckless life begun,
To dogs, to vultures, and to Peleus' son!
Oh! in his dearest blood might I allay
My rage, and these barbarities repay!
For ah! could Hector merit thus, whose breath
Expired not meanly, in unactive death?
He poured his latest blood in manly fight,
And fell a hero in his country's right."

"Seek not to stay me, nor my soul affright
With words of omen, like a bird of night,
(Replied unmoved the venerable man;)
'Tis heaven commands me, and you urge in vain.
Had any mortal voice the injunction laid,
Nor augur, priest, nor seer, had been obey'd.
A present goddess brought the high command,
I saw, I heard her, and the word shall stand.
I go, ye gods! obedient to your call:
If in yon camp your powers have doom'd my fall,
Content--By the same hand let me expire!
Add to the slaughter'd son the wretched sire!
One cold embrace at least may be allow'd,
And my last tears flow mingled with his blood!"

From forth his open'd stores, this said, he drew
Twelve costly carpets of refulgent hue,
As many vests, as many mantles told,
And twelve fair veils, and garments stiff with gold,
Two tripods next, and twice two chargers shine,
With ten pure talents from the richest mine;
And last a large well-labour'd bowl had place,
(The pledge of treaties once with friendly Thrace:)
Seem'd all too mean the stores he could employ,
For one last look to buy him back to Troy!

Lo! the sad father, frantic with his pain,
Around him furious drives his menial train:
In vain each slave with duteous care attends,
Each office hurts him, and each face offends.
"What make ye here, officious crowds! (he cries).
Hence! nor obtrude your anguish on my eyes.
Have ye no griefs at home, to fix ye there:
Am I the only object of despair?
Am I become my people's common show,
Set up by Jove your spectacle of woe?
No, you must feel him too; yourselves must fall;
The same stern god to ruin gives you all:
Nor is great Hector lost by me alone;
Your sole defence, your guardian power is gone!
I see your blood the fields of Phrygia drown,
I see the ruins of your smoking town!
O send me, gods! ere that sad day shall come,
A willing ghost to Pluto's dreary dome!"

He said, and feebly drives his friends away:
The sorrowing friends his frantic rage obey.
Next on his sons his erring fury falls,
Polites, Paris, Agathon, he calls;
His threats Deiphobus and Dius hear,
Hippothous, Pammon, Helenes the seer,
And generous Antiphon: for yet these nine
Survived, sad relics of his numerous line.

"Inglorious sons of an unhappy sire!
Why did not all in Hector's cause expire?
Wretch that I am! my bravest offspring slain.
You, the disgrace of Priam's house, remain!
Mestor the brave, renown'd in ranks of war,
With Troilus, dreadful on his rushing car,(293)
And last great Hector, more than man divine,
For sure he seem'd not of terrestrial line!
All those relentless Mars untimely slew,
And left me these, a soft and servile crew,
Whose days the feast and wanton dance employ,
Gluttons and flatterers, the contempt of Troy!
Why teach ye not my rapid wheels to run,
And speed my journey to redeem my son?"

The sons their father's wretched age revere,
Forgive his anger, and produce the car.
High on the seat the cabinet they bind:
The new-made car with solid beauty shined;
Box was the yoke, emboss'd with costly pains,
And hung with ringlets to receive the reins;
Nine cubits long, the traces swept the ground:
These to the chariot's polish'd pole they bound.
Then fix'd a ring the running reins to guide,
And close beneath the gather'd ends were tied.
Next with the gifts (the price of Hector slain)
The sad attendants load the groaning wain:
Last to the yoke the well-matched mules they bring,
(The gift of Mysia to the Trojan king.)
But the fair horses, long his darling care,
Himself received, and harness'd to his car:
Grieved as he was, he not this task denied;
The hoary herald help'd him, at his side.
While careful these the gentle coursers join'd,
Sad Hecuba approach'd with anxious mind;
A golden bowl that foam'd with fragrant wine,
(Libation destined to the power divine,)
Held in her right, before the steed she stands,
And thus consigns it to the monarch's hands:

"Take this, and pour to Jove; that safe from harms
His grace restore thee to our roof and arms.
Since victor of thy fears, and slighting mine,
Heaven, or thy soul, inspires this bold design;
Pray to that god, who high on Ida's brow
Surveys thy desolated realms below,
His winged messenger to send from high,
And lead thy way with heavenly augury:
Let the strong sovereign of the plumy race
Tower on the right of yon ethereal space.
That sign beheld, and strengthen'd from above,
Boldly pursue the journey mark'd by Jove:
But if the god his augury denies,
Suppress thy impulse, nor reject advice."

"'Tis just (said Priam) to the sire above
To raise our hands; for who so good as Jove?"
He spoke, and bade the attendant handmaid bring
The purest water of the living spring:
(Her ready hands the ewer and bason held:)
Then took the golden cup his queen had fill'd;
On the mid pavement pours the rosy wine,
Uplifts his eyes, and calls the power divine:

"O first and greatest! heaven's imperial lord!
On lofty Ida's holy hill adored!
To stern Achilles now direct my ways,
And teach him mercy when a father prays.
If such thy will, despatch from yonder sky
Thy sacred bird, celestial augury!
Let the strong sovereign of the plumy race
Tower on the right of yon ethereal space;
So shall thy suppliant, strengthen'd from above,
Fearless pursue the journey mark'd by Jove."

Jove heard his prayer, and from the throne on high,
Despatch'd his bird, celestial augury!
The swift-wing'd chaser of the feather'd game,
And known to gods by Percnos' lofty name.
Wide as appears some palace-gate display'd.
So broad, his pinions stretch'd their ample shade,
As stooping dexter with resounding wings
The imperial bird descends in airy rings.
A dawn of joy in every face appears:
The mourning matron dries her timorous tears:
Swift on his car the impatient monarch sprung;
The brazen portal in his passage rung;
The mules preceding draw the loaded wain,
Charged with the gifts: Idaeus holds the rein:
The king himself his gentle steeds controls,
And through surrounding friends the chariot rolls.
On his slow wheels the following people wait,
Mourn at each step, and give him up to fate;
With hands uplifted eye him as he pass'd,
And gaze upon him as they gazed their last.
Now forward fares the father on his way,
Through the lone fields, and back to Ilion they.
Great Jove beheld him as he cross'd the plain,
And felt the woes of miserable man.
Then thus to Hermes: "Thou whose constant cares
Still succour mortals, and attend their prayers;
Behold an object to thy charge consign'd:
If ever pity touch'd thee for mankind,
Go, guard the sire: the observing foe prevent,
And safe conduct him to Achilles' tent."

The god obeys, his golden pinions binds,(294)
And mounts incumbent on the wings of winds,
That high, through fields of air, his flight sustain,
O'er the wide earth, and o'er the boundless main;
Then grasps the wand that causes sleep to fly,
Or in soft slumbers seals the wakeful eye:
Thus arm'd, swift Hermes steers his airy way,
And stoops on Hellespont's resounding sea.
A beauteous youth, majestic and divine,
He seem'd; fair offspring of some princely line!
Now twilight veil'd the glaring face of day,
And clad the dusky fields in sober grey;
What time the herald and the hoary king
(Their chariots stopping at the silver spring,
That circling Ilus' ancient marble flows)
Allow'd their mules and steeds a short repose,
Through the dim shade the herald first espies
A man's approach, and thus to Priam cries:
"I mark some foe's advance: O king! beware;
This hard adventure claims thy utmost care!
For much I fear destruction hovers nigh:
Our state asks counsel; is it best to fly?
Or old and helpless, at his feet to fall,
Two wretched suppliants, and for mercy call?"

The afflicted monarch shiver'd with despair;
Pale grew his face, and upright stood his hair;
Sunk was his heart; his colour went and came;
A sudden trembling shook his aged frame:
When Hermes, greeting, touch'd his royal hand,
And, gentle, thus accosts with kind demand:

"Say whither, father! when each mortal sight
Is seal'd in sleep, thou wanderest through the night?
Why roam thy mules and steeds the plains along,
Through Grecian foes, so numerous and so strong?
What couldst thou hope, should these thy treasures view;
These, who with endless hate thy race pursue?
For what defence, alas! could'st thou provide;
Thyself not young, a weak old man thy guide?
Yet suffer not thy soul to sink with dread;
From me no harm shall touch thy reverend head;
From Greece I'll guard thee too; for in those lines
The living image of my father shines."

"Thy words, that speak benevolence of mind,
Are true, my son! (the godlike sire rejoin'd:)
Great are my hazards; but the gods survey
My steps, and send thee, guardian of my way.
Hail, and be bless'd! For scarce of mortal kind
Appear thy form, thy feature, and thy mind."

"Nor true are all thy words, nor erring wide;
(The sacred messenger of heaven replied;)
But say, convey'st thou through the lonely plains
What yet most precious of thy store remains,
To lodge in safety with some friendly hand:
Prepared, perchance, to leave thy native land?
Or fliest thou now?--What hopes can Troy retain,
Thy matchless son, her guard and glory, slain?"

The king, alarm'd: "Say what, and whence thou art
Who search the sorrows of a parent's heart,
And know so well how godlike Hector died?"
Thus Priam spoke, and Hermes thus replied:

"You tempt me, father, and with pity touch:
On this sad subject you inquire too much.
Oft have these eyes that godlike Hector view'd
In glorious fight, with Grecian blood embrued:
I saw him when, like Jove, his flames he toss'd
On thousand ships, and wither'd half a host:
I saw, but help'd not: stern Achilles' ire
Forbade assistance, and enjoy'd the fire.
For him I serve, of Myrmidonian race;
One ship convey'd us from our native place;
Polyctor is my sire, an honour'd name,
Old like thyself, and not unknown to fame;
Of seven his sons, by whom the lot was cast
To serve our prince, it fell on me, the last.
To watch this quarter, my adventure falls:
For with the morn the Greeks attack your walls;
Sleepless they sit, impatient to engage,
And scarce their rulers check their martial rage."

"If then thou art of stern Pelides' train,
(The mournful monarch thus rejoin'd again,)
Ah tell me truly, where, oh! where are laid
My son's dear relics? what befals him dead?
Have dogs dismember'd (on the naked plains),
Or yet unmangled rest, his cold remains?"

"O favour'd of the skies! (thus answered then
The power that mediates between god and men)
Nor dogs nor vultures have thy Hector rent,
But whole he lies, neglected in the tent:
This the twelfth evening since he rested there,
Untouch'd by worms, untainted by the air.
Still as Aurora's ruddy beam is spread,
Round his friend's tomb Achilles drags the dead:
Yet undisfigured, or in limb or face,
All fresh he lies, with every living grace,
Majestical in death! No stains are found
O'er all the corse, and closed is every wound,
Though many a wound they gave. Some heavenly care,
Some hand divine, preserves him ever fair:
Or all the host of heaven, to whom he led
A life so grateful, still regard him dead."

Thus spoke to Priam the celestial guide,
And joyful thus the royal sire replied:
"Blest is the man who pays the gods above
The constant tribute of respect and love!
Those who inhabit the Olympian bower
My son forgot not, in exalted power;
And heaven, that every virtue bears in mind,
Even to the ashes of the just is kind.
But thou, O generous youth! this goblet take,
A pledge of gratitude for Hector's sake;
And while the favouring gods our steps survey,
Safe to Pelides' tent conduct my way."

To whom the latent god: "O king, forbear
To tempt my youth, for apt is youth to err.
But can I, absent from my prince's sight,
Take gifts in secret, that must shun the light?
What from our master's interest thus we draw,
Is but a licensed theft that 'scapes the law.
Respecting him, my soul abjures the offence;
And as the crime, I dread the consequence.
Thee, far as Argos, pleased I could convey;
Guard of thy life, and partner of thy way:
On thee attend, thy safety to maintain,
O'er pathless forests, or the roaring main."

He said, then took the chariot at a bound,
And snatch'd the reins, and whirl'd the lash around:
Before the inspiring god that urged them on,
The coursers fly with spirit not their own.
And now they reach'd the naval walls, and found
The guards repasting, while the bowls go round;
On these the virtue of his wand he tries,
And pours deep slumber on their watchful eyes:
Then heaved the massy gates, removed the bars,
And o'er the trenches led the rolling cars.
Unseen, through all the hostile camp they went,
And now approach'd Pelides' lofty tent.
On firs the roof was raised, and cover'd o'er
With reeds collected from the marshy shore;
And, fenced with palisades, a hall of state,
(The work of soldiers,) where the hero sat.
Large was the door, whose well-compacted strength
A solid pine-tree barr'd of wondrous length:
Scarce three strong Greeks could lift its mighty weight,
But great Achilles singly closed the gate.
This Hermes (such the power of gods) set wide;
Then swift alighted the celestial guide,
And thus reveal'd--"Hear, prince! and understand
Thou ow'st thy guidance to no mortal hand:
Hermes I am, descended from above,
The king of arts, the messenger of Jove,
Farewell: to shun Achilles' sight I fly;
Uncommon are such favours of the sky,
Nor stand confess'd to frail mortality.
Now fearless enter, and prefer thy prayers;
Adjure him by his father's silver hairs,
His son, his mother! urge him to bestow
Whatever pity that stern heart can know."

Thus having said, he vanish'd from his eyes,
And in a moment shot into the skies:
The king, confirm'd from heaven, alighted there,
And left his aged herald on the car,
With solemn pace through various rooms he went,
And found Achilles in his inner tent:
There sat the hero: Alcimus the brave,
And great Automedon, attendance gave:
These served his person at the royal feast;
Around, at awful distance, stood the rest.

Unseen by these, the king his entry made:
And, prostrate now before Achilles laid,
Sudden (a venerable sight!) appears;
Embraced his knees, and bathed his hands in tears;
Those direful hands his kisses press'd, embrued
Even with the best, the dearest of his blood!

As when a wretch (who, conscious of his crime,
Pursued for murder, flies his native clime)
Just gains some frontier, breathless, pale, amazed,
All gaze, all wonder: thus Achilles gazed:
Thus stood the attendants stupid with surprise:
All mute, yet seem'd to question with their eyes:
Each look'd on other, none the silence broke,
Till thus at last the kingly suppliant spoke:

"Ah think, thou favour'd of the powers divine!(295)
Think of thy father's age, and pity mine!
In me that father's reverend image trace,
Those silver hairs, that venerable face;
His trembling limbs, his helpless person, see!
In all my equal, but in misery!
Yet now, perhaps, some turn of human fate
Expels him helpless from his peaceful state;
Think, from some powerful foe thou seest him fly,
And beg protection with a feeble cry.
Yet still one comfort in his soul may rise;
He hears his son still lives to glad his eyes,
And, hearing, still may hope a better day
May send him thee, to chase that foe away.
No comfort to my griefs, no hopes remain,
The best, the bravest, of my sons are slain!
Yet what a race! ere Greece to Ilion came,
The pledge of many a loved and loving dame:
Nineteen one mother bore--Dead, all are dead!
How oft, alas! has wretched Priam bled!
Still one was left their loss to recompense;
His father's hope, his country's last defence.
Him too thy rage has slain! beneath thy steel,
Unhappy in his country's cause he fell!

"For him through hostile camps I bent my way,
For him thus prostrate at thy feet I lay;
Large gifts proportion'd to thy wrath I bear;
O hear the wretched, and the gods revere!

"Think of thy father, and this face behold!
See him in me, as helpless and as old!
Though not so wretched: there he yields to me,
The first of men in sovereign misery!
Thus forced to kneel, thus grovelling to embrace
The scourge and ruin of my realm and race;
Suppliant my children's murderer to implore,
And kiss those hands yet reeking with their gore!"

These words soft pity in the chief inspire,
Touch'd with the dear remembrance of his sire.
Then with his hand (as prostrate still he lay)
The old man's cheek he gently turn'd away.
Now each by turns indulged the gush of woe;
And now the mingled tides together flow:
This low on earth, that gently bending o'er;
A father one, and one a son deplore:
But great Achilles different passions rend,
And now his sire he mourns, and now his friend.
The infectious softness through the heroes ran;
One universal solemn shower began;
They bore as heroes, but they felt as man.

Satiate at length with unavailing woes,
From the high throne divine Achilles rose;
The reverend monarch by the hand he raised;
On his white beard and form majestic gazed,
Not unrelenting; then serene began
With words to soothe the miserable man:

"Alas, what weight of anguish hast thou known,
Unhappy prince! thus guardless and alone
Two pass through foes, and thus undaunted face
The man whose fury has destroy'd thy race!
Heaven sure has arm'd thee with a heart of steel,
A strength proportion'd to the woes you feel.
Rise, then: let reason mitigate your care:
To mourn avails not: man is born to bear.
Such is, alas! the gods' severe decree:
They, only they are blest, and only free.
Two urns by Jove's high throne have ever stood,
The source of evil one, and one of good;
From thence the cup of mortal man he fills,
Blessings to these, to those distributes ill;
To most he mingles both: the wretch decreed
To taste the bad unmix'd, is cursed indeed;
Pursued by wrongs, by meagre famine driven,
He wanders, outcast both of earth and heaven.
The happiest taste not happiness sincere;
But find the cordial draught is dash'd with care.
Who more than Peleus shone in wealth and power
What stars concurring bless'd his natal hour!
A realm, a goddess, to his wishes given;
Graced by the gods with all the gifts of heaven.
One evil yet o'ertakes his latest day:
No race succeeding to imperial sway;
An only son; and he, alas! ordain'd
To fall untimely in a foreign land.
See him, in Troy, the pious care decline
Of his weak age, to live the curse of thine!
Thou too, old man, hast happier days beheld;
In riches once, in children once excell'd;
Extended Phrygia own'd thy ample reign,
And all fair Lesbos' blissful seats contain,
And all wide Hellespont's unmeasured main.
But since the god his hand has pleased to turn,
And fill thy measure from his bitter urn,
What sees the sun, but hapless heroes' falls?
War, and the blood of men, surround thy walls!
What must be, must be. Bear thy lot, nor shed
These unavailing sorrows o'er the dead;
Thou canst not call him from the Stygian shore,
But thou, alas! may'st live to suffer more!"

To whom the king: "O favour'd of the skies!
Here let me grow to earth! since Hector lies
On the bare beach deprived of obsequies.
O give me Hector! to my eyes restore
His corse, and take the gifts: I ask no more.
Thou, as thou may'st, these boundless stores enjoy;
Safe may'st thou sail, and turn thy wrath from Troy;
So shall thy pity and forbearance give
A weak old man to see the light and live!"

"Move me no more, (Achilles thus replies,
While kindling anger sparkled in his eyes,)
Nor seek by tears my steady soul to bend:
To yield thy Hector I myself intend:
For know, from Jove my goddess-mother came,
(Old Ocean's daughter, silver-footed dame,)
Nor comest thou but by heaven; nor comest alone,
Some god impels with courage not thy own:
No human hand the weighty gates unbarr'd,
Nor could the boldest of our youth have dared
To pass our outworks, or elude the guard.
Cease; lest, neglectful of high Jove's command,
I show thee, king! thou tread'st on hostile land;
Release my knees, thy suppliant arts give o'er,
And shake the purpose of my soul no more."

The sire obey'd him, trembling and o'eraw'd.
Achilles, like a lion, rush'd abroad:
Automedon and Alcimus attend,
(Whom most he honour'd, since he lost his friend,)
These to unyoke the mules and horses went,
And led the hoary herald to the tent;
Next, heap'd on high, the numerous presents bear,
(Great Hector's ransom,) from the polish'd car.
Two splendid mantles, and a carpet spread,
They leave: to cover and enwrap the dead.
Then call the handmaids, with assistant toil
To wash the body and anoint with oil,
Apart from Priam: lest the unhappy sire,
Provoked to passion, once more rouse to ire
The stern Pelides; and nor sacred age,
Nor Jove's command, should check the rising rage.
This done, the garments o'er the corse they spread;
Achilles lifts it to the funeral bed:
Then, while the body on the car they laid,
He groans, and calls on loved Patroclus' shade:

"If, in that gloom which never light must know,
The deeds of mortals touch the ghosts below,
O friend! forgive me, that I thus fulfil
(Restoring Hector) heaven's unquestion'd will.
The gifts the father gave, be ever thine,
To grace thy manes, and adorn thy shrine."(296)

He said, and, entering, took his seat of state;
Where full before him reverend Priam sate;
To whom, composed, the godlike chief begun:
"Lo! to thy prayer restored, thy breathless son;
Extended on the funeral couch he lies;
And soon as morning paints the eastern skies,
The sight is granted to thy longing eyes:
But now the peaceful hours of sacred night
Demand reflection, and to rest invite:
Nor thou, O father! thus consumed with woe,
The common cares that nourish life forego.
Not thus did Niobe, of form divine,
A parent once, whose sorrows equall'd thine:
Six youthful sons, as many blooming maids,
In one sad day beheld the Stygian shades;
Those by Apollo's silver bow were slain,
These, Cynthia's arrows stretch'd upon the plain:
So was her pride chastised by wrath divine,
Who match'd her own with bright Latona's line;
But two the goddess, twelve the queen enjoy'd;
Those boasted twelve, the avenging two destroy'd.
Steep'd in their blood, and in the dust outspread,
Nine days, neglected, lay exposed the dead;
None by to weep them, to inhume them none;
(For Jove had turn'd the nation all to stone.)
The gods themselves, at length relenting gave
The unhappy race the honours of a grave.
Herself a rock (for such was heaven's high will)
Through deserts wild now pours a weeping rill;
Where round the bed whence Achelous springs,
The watery fairies dance in mazy rings;
There high on Sipylus's shaggy brow,
She stands, her own sad monument of woe;
The rock for ever lasts, the tears for ever flow.

"Such griefs, O king! have other parents known;
Remember theirs, and mitigate thy own.
The care of heaven thy Hector has appear'd,
Nor shall he lie unwept, and uninterr'd;
Soon may thy aged cheeks in tears be drown'd,
And all the eyes of Ilion stream around."

He said, and, rising, chose the victim ewe
With silver fleece, which his attendants slew.
The limbs they sever from the reeking hide,
With skill prepare them, and in parts divide:
Each on the coals the separate morsels lays,
And, hasty, snatches from the rising blaze.
With bread the glittering canisters they load,
Which round the board Automedon bestow'd.
The chief himself to each his portion placed,
And each indulging shared in sweet repast.
When now the rage of hunger was repress'd,
The wondering hero eyes his royal guest:
No less the royal guest the hero eyes,
His godlike aspect and majestic size;
Here, youthful grace and noble fire engage;
And there, the mild benevolence of age.
Thus gazing long, the silence neither broke,
(A solemn scene!) at length the father spoke:

"Permit me now, beloved of Jove! to steep
My careful temples in the dew of sleep:
For, since the day that number'd with the dead
My hapless son, the dust has been my bed;
Soft sleep a stranger to my weeping eyes;
My only food, my sorrows and my sighs!
Till now, encouraged by the grace you give,
I share thy banquet, and consent to live."

With that, Achilles bade prepare the bed,
With purple soft and shaggy carpets spread;
Forth, by the flaming lights, they bend their way,
And place the couches, and the coverings lay.
Then he: "Now, father, sleep, but sleep not here;
Consult thy safety, and forgive my fear,
Lest any Argive, at this hour awake,
To ask our counsel, or our orders take,
Approaching sudden to our open'd tent,
Perchance behold thee, and our grace prevent.
Should such report thy honour'd person here,
The king of men the ransom might defer;
But say with speed, if aught of thy desire
Remains unask'd; what time the rites require
To inter thy Hector? For, so long we stay
Our slaughtering arm, and bid the hosts obey."

"If then thy will permit (the monarch said)
To finish all due honours to the dead,
This of thy grace accord: to thee are known
The fears of Ilion, closed within her town;
And at what distance from our walls aspire
The hills of Ide, and forests for the fire.
Nine days to vent our sorrows I request,
The tenth shall see the funeral and the feast;
The next, to raise his monument be given;
The twelfth we war, if war be doom'd by heaven!"

"This thy request (replied the chief) enjoy:
Till then our arms suspend the fall of Troy."

Then gave his hand at parting, to prevent
The old man's fears, and turn'd within the tent;
Where fair Briseis, bright in blooming charms,
Expects her hero with desiring arms.
But in the porch the king and herald rest;
Sad dreams of care yet wandering in their breast.
Now gods and men the gifts of sleep partake;
Industrious Hermes only was awake,
The king's return revolving in his mind,
To pass the ramparts, and the watch to blind.
The power descending hover'd o'er his head:
"And sleep'st thou, father! (thus the vision said:)
Now dost thou sleep, when Hector is restored?
Nor fear the Grecian foes, or Grecian lord?
Thy presence here should stern Atrides see,
Thy still surviving sons may sue for thee;
May offer all thy treasures yet contain,
To spare thy age; and offer all in vain."

Waked with the word the trembling sire arose,
And raised his friend: the god before him goes:
He joins the mules, directs them with his hand,
And moves in silence through the hostile land.
When now to Xanthus' yellow stream they drove,
(Xanthus, immortal progeny of Jove,)
The winged deity forsook their view,
And in a moment to Olympus flew.
Now shed Aurora round her saffron ray,
Sprang through the gates of light, and gave the day:
Charged with the mournful load, to Ilion go
The sage and king, majestically slow.
Cassandra first beholds, from Ilion's spire,
The sad procession of her hoary sire;
Then, as the pensive pomp advanced more near,
(Her breathless brother stretched upon the bier,)
A shower of tears o'erflows her beauteous eyes,
Alarming thus all Ilion with her cries:

"Turn here your steps, and here your eyes employ,
Ye wretched daughters, and ye sons of Troy!
If e'er ye rush'd in crowds, with vast delight,
To hail your hero glorious from the fight,
Now meet him dead, and let your sorrows flow;
Your common triumph, and your common woe."

In thronging crowds they issue to the plains;
Nor man nor woman in the walls remains;
In every face the self-same grief is shown;
And Troy sends forth one universal groan.
At Scaea's gates they meet the mourning wain,
Hang on the wheels, and grovel round the slain.
The wife and mother, frantic with despair,
Kiss his pale cheek, and rend their scatter'd hair:
Thus wildly wailing, at the gates they lay;
And there had sigh'd and sorrow'd out the day;
But godlike Priam from the chariot rose:
"Forbear (he cried) this violence of woes;
First to the palace let the car proceed,
Then pour your boundless sorrows o'er the dead."

The waves of people at his word divide,
Slow rolls the chariot through the following tide;
Even to the palace the sad pomp they wait:
They weep, and place him on the bed of state.
A melancholy choir attend around,
With plaintive sighs, and music's solemn sound:
Alternately they sing, alternate flow
The obedient tears, melodious in their woe.
While deeper sorrows groan from each full heart,
And nature speaks at every pause of art.

First to the corse the weeping consort flew;
Around his neck her milk-white arms she threw,
"And oh, my Hector! Oh, my lord! (she cries)
Snatch'd in thy bloom from these desiring eyes!
Thou to the dismal realms for ever gone!
And I abandon'd, desolate, alone!
An only son, once comfort of our pains,
Sad product now of hapless love, remains!
Never to manly age that son shall rise,
Or with increasing graces glad my eyes:
For Ilion now (her great defender slain)
Shall sink a smoking ruin on the plain.
Who now protects her wives with guardian care?
Who saves her infants from the rage of war?
Now hostile fleets must waft those infants o'er
(Those wives must wait them) to a foreign shore:
Thou too, my son, to barbarous climes shall go,
The sad companion of thy mother's woe;
Driven hence a slave before the victor's sword
Condemn'd to toil for some inhuman lord:
Or else some Greek whose father press'd the plain,
Or son, or brother, by great Hector slain,
In Hector's blood his vengeance shall enjoy,
And hurl thee headlong from the towers of Troy.(297)
For thy stern father never spared a foe:
Thence all these tears, and all this scene of woe!
Thence many evils his sad parents bore,
His parents many, but his consort more.
Why gav'st thou not to me thy dying hand?
And why received not I thy last command?
Some word thou would'st have spoke, which, sadly dear,
My soul might keep, or utter with a tear;
Which never, never could be lost in air,
Fix'd in my heart, and oft repeated there!"

Thus to her weeping maids she makes her moan,
Her weeping handmaids echo groan for groan.

The mournful mother next sustains her part:
"O thou, the best, the dearest to my heart!
Of all my race thou most by heaven approved,
And by the immortals even in death beloved!
While all my other sons in barbarous bands
Achilles bound, and sold to foreign lands,
This felt no chains, but went a glorious ghost,
Free, and a hero, to the Stygian coast.
Sentenced, 'tis true, by his inhuman doom,
Thy noble corse was dragg'd around the tomb;
(The tomb of him thy warlike arm had slain;)
Ungenerous insult, impotent and vain!
Yet glow'st thou fresh with every living grace;
No mark of pain, or violence of face:
Rosy and fair! as Phoebus' silver bow
Dismiss'd thee gently to the shades below."

Thus spoke the dame, and melted into tears.
Sad Helen next in pomp of grief appears;
Fast from the shining sluices of her eyes
Fall the round crystal drops, while thus she cries.

"Ah, dearest friend! in whom the gods had join'd(298)
Tne mildest manners with the bravest mind,
Now twice ten years (unhappy years) are o'er
Since Paris brought me to the Trojan shore,
(O had I perish'd, ere that form divine
Seduced this soft, this easy heart of mine!)
Yet was it ne'er my fate, from thee to find
A deed ungentle, or a word unkind.
When others cursed the authoress of their woe,
Thy pity check'd my sorrows in their flow.
If some proud brother eyed me with disdain,
Or scornful sister with her sweeping train,
Thy gentle accents soften'd all my pain.
For thee I mourn, and mourn myself in thee,
The wretched source of all this misery.
The fate I caused, for ever I bemoan;
Sad Helen has no friend, now thou art gone!
Through Troy's wide streets abandon'd shall I roam!
In Troy deserted, as abhorr'd at home!"

So spoke the fair, with sorrow-streaming eye.
Distressful beauty melts each stander-by.
On all around the infectious sorrow grows;
But Priam check'd the torrent as it rose:
"Perform, ye Trojans! what the rites require,
And fell the forests for a funeral pyre;
Twelve days, nor foes nor secret ambush dread;
Achilles grants these honours to the dead."(299)

                  [Illustration: FUNERAL OF HECTOR.]

                          FUNERAL OF HECTOR.


He spoke, and, at his word, the Trojan train
Their mules and oxen harness to the wain,
Pour through the gates, and fell'd from Ida's crown,
Roll back the gather'd forests to the town.
These toils continue nine succeeding days,
And high in air a sylvan structure raise.
But when the tenth fair morn began to shine,
Forth to the pile was borne the man divine,
And placed aloft; while all, with streaming eyes,
Beheld the flames and rolling smokes arise.
Soon as Aurora, daughter of the dawn,
With rosy lustre streak'd the dewy lawn,
Again the mournful crowds surround the pyre,
And quench with wine the yet remaining fire.
The snowy bones his friends and brothers place
(With tears collected) in a golden vase;
The golden vase in purple palls they roll'd,
Of softest texture, and inwrought with gold.
Last o'er the urn the sacred earth they spread,
And raised the tomb, memorial of the dead.
(Strong guards and spies, till all the rites were done,
Watch'd from the rising to the setting sun.)
All Troy then moves to Priam's court again,
A solemn, silent, melancholy train:
Assembled there, from pious toil they rest,
And sadly shared the last sepulchral feast.
Such honours Ilion to her hero paid,
And peaceful slept the mighty Hector's shade.(300)





CONCLUDING NOTE.


We have now passed through the Iliad, and seen the anger of Achilles, and
the terrible effects of it, at an end, as that only was the subject of the
poem, and the nature of epic poetry would not permit our author to proceed
to the event of the war, it perhaps may be acceptable to the common reader
to give a short account of what happened to Troy and the chief actors in
this poem after the conclusion of it.

I need not mention that Troy was taken soon after the death of Hector by
the stratagem of the wooden horse, the particulars of which are described
by Virgil in the second book of the Ćneid.

Achilles fell before Troy, by the hand of Paris, by the shot of an arrow
in his heel, as Hector had prophesied at his death, lib. xxii.

The unfortunate Priam was killed by Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles.

Ajax, after the death of Achilles, had a contest with Ulysses for the
armour of Vulcan, but being defeated in his aim, he slew himself through
indignation.

Helen, after the death of Paris, married Deiphobus his brother, and at the
taking of Troy betrayed him, in order to reconcile herself to Menelaus her
first husband, who received her again into favour.

Agamemnon at his return was barbarously murdered by Ćgysthus, at the
instigation of Clytemnestra his wife, who in his absence had dishonoured
his bed with Ćgysthus.

Diomed, after the fall of Troy, was expelled his own country, and scarce
escaped with his life from his adulterous wife Ćgiale; but at last was
received by Daunus in Apulia, and shared his kingdom; it is uncertain how
he died.

Nestor lived in peace with his children, in Pylos, his native country.

Ulysses also, after innumerable troubles by sea and land, at last returned
in safety to Ithaca, which is the subject of Homer's Odyssey.

For what remains, I beg to be excused from the ceremonies of taking leave
at the end of my work, and from embarrassing myself, or others, with any
defences or apologies about it. But instead of endeavouring to raise a
vain monument to myself, of the merits or difficulties of it (which must
be left to the world, to truth, and to posterity), let me leave behind me
a memorial of my friendship with one of the most valuable of men, as well
as finest writers, of my age and country, one who has tried, and knows by
his own experience, how hard an undertaking it is to do justice to Homer,
and one whom (I am sure) sincerely rejoices with me at the period of my
labours. To him, therefore, having brought this long work to a conclusion,
I desire to dedicate it, and to have the honour and satisfaction of
placing together, in this manner, the names of Mr. CONGREVE, and of
